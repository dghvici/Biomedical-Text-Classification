40575969,The effects of radiation therapy on the brain: implications for management.,"Radiation therapy (RT) plays a critical role in the management of intracranial malignancies, offering a potent and targeted approach to tumor control. The benefits of RT have been recognized for decades, and it is commonly employed in the management of both primary brain tumors and, especially, brain metastases. Through the induction of DNA damage and disruption of cellular integrity, RT promotes apoptosis and inhibits the proliferative capacity of cancer cells. Advances in imaging, dose planning, and delivery techniques have significantly enhanced the precision of RT, allowing for effective tumor eradication while minimizing harm to surrounding healthy tissue. As a result, RT improves local disease control and contributes to prolonged survival in patients with brain tumors. Nonetheless, intracranial RT may inadvertently damage surrounding healthy brain structures. The effects of RT can manifest as both acute and delayed toxicities, potentially compromising patient quality of life and long-term outcomes. For treating clinicians, a thorough understanding of these complications is necessary to design radiation treatment plans that properly balance the therapeutic efficacy of therapy with the risks of adverse treatment-related outcomes. In this review, we explore the distinct pathophysiological mechanisms, symptoms, and management strategies associated with acute, early delayed (one to six months), and late delayed radiation-induced brain toxicities. In particular, we discuss the risks of somnolence syndrome, peri-ictal pseudoprogression, radiation necrosis, vascular disorders, cognitive impairment, cranial neuropathies, endocrine dysfunction, the development of secondary malignancies, stroke-like migraine attacks after radiation therapy (SMART) syndrome, and acute late-onset encephalopathy after radiation therapy (ALERT) syndrome after brain RT.",Chinese clinical oncology,2025.0,Bayle Smith-Salzberg; Kristin Hsieh; Daniel Cherry; Julie R Bloom; Catherine Yu; Anthony D Nehlsen; Lucas Resende Salgado; Kunal K Sindhu,radiation therapy rt play critical role management intracranial malignancy offer potent target approach tumor control benefit rt recognize decade commonly employ management primary brain tumor especially brain metastasis induction dna damage disruption cellular integrity rt promote apoptosis inhibit proliferative capacity cancer cell advance imaging dose planning delivery technique significantly enhance precision rt allow effective tumor eradication minimize harm surround healthy tissue result rt improve local disease control contribute prolonged survival patient brain tumor nonetheless intracranial rt inadvertently damage surround healthy brain structure effect rt manifest acute delayed toxicity potentially compromise patient quality life long term outcome treat clinician thorough understanding complication necessary design radiation treatment plan properly balance therapeutic efficacy therapy risk adverse treatment relate outcome review explore distinct pathophysiological mechanism symptom management strategy associate acute early delay month late delay radiation induce brain toxicity particular discuss risk somnolence syndrome peri ictal pseudoprogression radiation necrosis vascular disorder cognitive impairment cranial neuropathy endocrine dysfunction development secondary malignancy stroke like migraine attack radiation therapy smart syndrome acute late onset encephalopathy radiation therapy alert syndrome brain rt
40575926,Polyvalent immunoglobulin therapy: preclinical evidence and potential for treating chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.,"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a prevalent and often debilitating complication of cancer treatment, affecting over 68% of treated patients. This condition is characterized by sensory deficits, neuropathic pain, and reduced quality of life. While polyvalent human immunoglobulins (IVIg) are established treatments for various immune-mediated neurological disorders, including certain inflammatory and autoimmune peripheral neuropathies, their role in CIPN remains unexplored in clinical settings. This review examines the neuroprotective properties of IVIg, focusing on approved indications, and explores recent preclinical evidence on the role of neuroinflammation in CIPN pathophysiology. We propose that IVIg could, based on preclinical findings, offer therapeutic benefits in managing CIPN without interfering with cancer treatments, provided that future clinical validation supports its efficacy and safety. Although there is currently no clinical experience with IVIg in CIPN patients, preclinical data suggest promising therapeutic prospects. Future research is essential to elucidate CIPN mechanisms further and to determine how IVIg might contribute as a novel therapeutic strategy, ultimately improving the quality of life for cancer patients.",Expert opinion on investigational drugs,2025.0,William Moret; Aurore Danigo; Simon Frachet; Franck Sturtz; Sylvie Bourthoumieu; Laurent Magy; Claire Demiot; Amandine Rovini,chemotherapy induce peripheral neuropathy cipn prevalent debilitate complication cancer treatment affect 68 treat patient condition characterize sensory deficit neuropathic pain reduce quality life polyvalent human immunoglobulin ivig establish treatment immune mediate neurological disorder include certain inflammatory autoimmune peripheral neuropathy role cipn remain unexplored clinical setting review examine neuroprotective property ivig focus approve indication explore recent preclinical evidence role neuroinflammation cipn pathophysiology propose ivig base preclinical finding offer therapeutic benefit manage cipn interfere cancer treatment provide future clinical validation support efficacy safety currently clinical experience ivig cipn patient preclinical datum suggest promise therapeutic prospect future research essential elucidate cipn mechanism determine ivig contribute novel therapeutic strategy ultimately improve quality life cancer patient

40575809,Assessment of mental health symptoms in new refugees.,"Refugees have a higher prevalence of mental disorders than the general population. The Norwegian Directorate of Health recommends screening for traumatic experiences and assessing mental health symptoms three months atter arrival when deemed relevant. However, it is uncertain whether this recommendation helps identify individuals at increased risk of a mental disorder. The aim of the study was to investigate whether assessing mental health symptoms and the risk of mental disorders in newly arrived refugees can help identify individuals who subsequently experience mental health problems. We conducted a retrospective study based on the medical records of refugees who underwent a health assessment at Hommelvik Medical Centre in the period 2016-2019 and the Centre for Migration Health (SEMI) in Bergen in 2022. The risk of mental disorders was categorised as high, moderate or low. Symptoms of mental disorders were recorded during the follow-up period, which was two years and one year, respectively. A total of 123 refugees were included in the study. Based on the health assessments, 50 participants (41 %) were retrospectively assessed as having a low risk of a mental disorder, 30 (24 %) a moderate risk and 12 (10 %) a high risk. There was insufficient medical documentation to perform a risk assessment for 31 participants (25 %). During the follow-up period, mental health symptoms were observed in 9 of the 12 high-risk participants, compared to 5 of the 50 low-risk participants. Conducting health and risk assessments three months atter arrival in Norway can help identify refugees who subsequently experience symptoms of a mental disorder.","Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",2025.0,Trygve Sølberg Ellingsen; Frida Faaland; Espen Bjertness; Kjærsti Thorsteinsen; Johanna Laue,refugee high prevalence mental disorder general population norwegian directorate health recommend screen traumatic experience assess mental health symptom month atter arrival deem relevant uncertain recommendation helps identify individual increase risk mental disorder aim study investigate assess mental health symptom risk mental disorder newly arrive refugee help identify individual subsequently experience mental health problem conduct retrospective study base medical record refugee undergo health assessment hommelvik medical centre period 2016 2019 centre migration health semi bergen 2022 risk mental disorder categorise high moderate low symptom mental disorder record follow period year year respectively total 123 refugee include study base health assessment 50 participant 41 retrospectively assess have low risk mental disorder 30 24 moderate risk 12 10 high risk insufficient medical documentation perform risk assessment 31 participant 25 follow period mental health symptom observe 9 12 high risk participant compare 5 50 low risk participant conduct health risk assessment month atter arrival norway help identify refugee subsequently experience symptom mental disorder

This study aimed to develop a hospital-based educational and follow-up strategy at Ziaeian Hospital and assess how it affected the diabetic patients' health outcomes. This study was a community-level intervention based on Compassion-Focused Therapy (CFT). The study was conducted from 2020 to 2022 at Ziaeian Hospital in District 17 of Tehran, involving 312 diabetic patients. Participants were randomly allocated to two groups: the intervention group (<i>n</i> = 156) and the control group (<i>n</i> = 156). The intervention group received structured education, continuous follow-up, and family engagement, while the control group underwent standard treatment. Data were collected using a researcher-developed questionnaire and the SF-36 quality of life assessment. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 14.02, with significance set at <i>P</i> < 0.05. The statistical tests employed included t-tests, Chi-squared tests, Fisher's exact test, and paired t-test. The mortality rate in the control group was therefore 9.03%, higher than the 5.52% noted in the intervention group. Baseline clinical markers (FBS, HbA1c, triglycerides, cholesterol, and BMI) showed no appreciable differences across the groups. Though no significant changes in social functioning, mental health, or physical performance, the intervention group showed notable improvements in overall quality of life (<i>p</i> = 0.0053), general health (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), energy/fatigue (<i>p</i> < 0.0001).

40575733,Persistent pain signaling and stress response in a mouse model of inflammatory low back pain.,"Chronic low back pain (LBP) is linked to dysfunction in both peripheral and central nervous systems and is a risk factor of psychiatric disorders such as depression. However, pain-related signaling in sensory and central neurons during chronic LBP, and its impact on stress-induced emotional behaviors, remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate persistent changes in pain-related and inflammation-related signaling in an inflammatory LBP mouse model and assess its influence on stress-related behaviors. An LBP-like condition was induced by administering complete Freund adjuvant to the lumbar region in mice. Behavioral assessments included gait analysis and mechanical sensitivity testing. Gene expression and immunohistological changes in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), spinal cord, and brain regions were examined. Chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) was used to evaluate stress susceptibility and emotion-related behavior. Complete Freund adjuvant-induced lumbar inflammation led to delayed onset of LBP-like behaviors, including impaired gait and hindpaw hypersensitivity, persisting into the chronic phase. Expression of inflammatory and pain-related genes was significantly elevated in the DRG and spinal cord in the lumbar region. Increased microglial activation and reduced <i>Bdnf</i> expression in the hippocampus were observed, accompanied by impaired hippocampal neurogenic process. Mice with LBP-like conditions exhibited heightened avoidance behavior following CSDS and an exaggerated hippocampal stress response. Chronic inflammation-induced LBP disrupts both peripheral and central neural function and may contribute to increased stress susceptibility and depression-like behaviors.",Pain reports,2025.0,Hiroaki Motohashi; Yasuhito Yamaji; Kazunari Mori; Sena Washizu; Oki Hoshino; Kotone Fujimoto; Seiji Kanazawa; Yoshihiko Minegishi; Noriyasu Ota; Takuya Mori; Eri Segi-Nishida,chronic low pain lbp link dysfunction peripheral central nervous system risk factor psychiatric disorder depression pain relate signaling sensory central neuron chronic lbp impact stress induce emotional behavior remains poorly understand aim study investigate persistent change pain relate inflammation relate signaling inflammatory lbp mouse model assess influence stress relate behavior lbp like condition induce administer complete freund adjuvant lumbar region mouse behavioral assessment include gait analysis mechanical sensitivity testing gene expression immunohistological change dorsal root ganglia drg spinal cord brain region examine chronic social defeat stress csds evaluate stress susceptibility emotion relate behavior complete freund adjuvant induce lumbar inflammation lead delay onset lbp like behavior include impaired gait hindpaw hypersensitivity persist chronic phase expression inflammatory pain relate gene significantly elevate drg spinal cord lumbar region increase microglial activation reduce < > bdnf</i > expression hippocampus observe accompany impaired hippocampal neurogenic process mouse lbp like condition exhibit heighten avoidance behavior follow csds exaggerated hippocampal stress response chronic inflammation induce lbp disrupt peripheral central neural function contribute increase stress susceptibility depression like behavior
40575691,Work Exposome and Related Disorders of Firefighters: An Overview of Systematized Reviews.,"Firefighters experience many exposures associated with negative health outcomes. Because of this, there are many studies on the subject. Our objective here was to conduct an umbrella review of systematized reviews to identify firefighting activities and related exposures associated with negative health outcomes. A comprehensive search of the PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus (Health) was conducted using all firefighter systematized reviews. We extracted the country and date of the review, type of firefighter, types of exposure, and related health outcomes. Risk of bias was based on AMSTAR-2 checklist. In 1130 studies, 47 systematized reviews were included, mostly in the last 5 years and from North America and Australia. The topics were diverse, ranging from general aspects to specific exposures, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, wildland fires, organizational, traumatic, or psychological stress exposure, and from prevention or surveillance to specific health effects (e.g., cancer, mental health, musculoskeletal disorders, cardiovascular, and pulmonary health, etc.). The risk of bias assessment using the selection grid shows a significant heterogeneity, though some studies were of very high quality.

40575660,A mixed methods exploration of the origin of dental anxiety and coping strategies among participants in a behavioral intervention for dental anxiety.,"Little is known about the onset and early progression of dental anxiety. The current mixed-methods study aimed to evaluate patient-reported early experiences and onset of dental anxiety, as well as the experience of managing dental anxiety (i.e., coping strategies and symptom severity). Adults (N=499) were recruited from a dental school clinic to participate in a clinical trial testing the efficacy of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based intervention for dental anxiety. As one aspect of this trial, participants answered the Anxiety and Related Disorders Interview Schedule. During this interview, participants described when they first noticed developing anxiety about dental appointments, as well as how they coped during their appointments. Assessments were repeated at one-month and three-month follow-ups. Bivariate associations (e.g., chi-square and t-test) and repeated measures ANOVA were explored. Qualitative data were coded in NVivo. The three identified origins for dental anxiety were: ""traumatic dental visit in childhood,"" ""traumatic dental visit in adulthood,"" and ""anxiety has always been present."" Participants who reported a childhood trauma had the highest levels of dental anxiety relative to the other two groups. In total, 30 unique coping mechanisms were identified. A reduction in avoidant coping strategies was observed among the intervention groups at both one-month and three-months, but not in the control group. Earlier negative dental experiences are more likely to result in greater anxiety severity. A one-time CBT-based dental anxiety treatment reduced the use of avoidant coping strategies, which may in turn reduce patient fears.",Frontiers in oral health,2025.0,Elizabeth Konneker; Devon Singh; Marisol Tellez; Amid I Ismail; Eugene M Dunne,little know onset early progression dental anxiety current mixed method study aim evaluate patient report early experience onset dental anxiety experience manage dental anxiety i.e. cope strategy symptom severity adult n=499 recruit dental school clinic participate clinical trial test efficacy cognitive behavioral therapy cbt)-base intervention dental anxiety aspect trial participant answer anxiety related disorders interview schedule interview participant describe notice develop anxiety dental appointment cope appointment assessment repeat month month follow up bivariate association e.g. chi square t test repeat measure anova explore qualitative datum code nvivo identify origin dental anxiety traumatic dental visit childhood traumatic dental visit adulthood anxiety present participant report childhood trauma high level dental anxiety relative group total 30 unique coping mechanism identify reduction avoidant cope strategy observe intervention group month month control group early negative dental experience likely result great anxiety severity time cbt base dental anxiety treatment reduce use avoidant cope strategy turn reduce patient fear
40575652,"Ultra-stretchable, adhesive and photothermal multifunctional hydrogel for renal denervation to treat hypertension.","Hypertension is a major risk factors for stroke, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic kidney diseases. Although taking antihypertension drugs improves the prognosis of hypertensive patients to a certain extent, there are still lots of refractory hypertension and non-adherent patients. Therefore, it is imperative to explore more effective and targeted treatment approaches. Herein, we construct a multifunctional photothermal hydrogel to treat hypertension and cardiac remodeling through renal denervation (RDN) under 808 nm near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation. The prepared multifunctional hydrogel, which is customized based on renal perivascular microenvironment, exhibits excellent stretchability, mechanical properties, flexibility and adhesion, ensuring it with remarkable conformability to the dynamic movements of the renal arteries throughout RDN procedures. Photothermal RDN achieved significant blood pressure reduction, with sustained decreases of 13.3 ± 2.5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and 10.6 ± 1.2 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure, persisting for 8 weeks post-treatment. Additionally, a reduction in myocardial fibrosis and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is observed, which indicative of the alleviation of cardiac remodeling. The antihypertensive effect of photothermal RDN is mediated through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) pathway and activation of the cGMP-PKG signaling cascade. The photothermal hydrogel-mediated RDN treatment provides a promising and innovative strategy for treating hypertension and cardiac remodeling.",Materials today.

40575556,Treatment of women with postpartum mental disorders in a day clinic mother-baby unit and the effect on child behavioural problems - A 1-year follow-up.,"Postpartum mental disorders are highly prevalent with substantial impact on mother-child bonding and child development. While short-term benefits of an interaction-focused mother-baby treatment for maternal mental health are documented, little is known about the stability of these effects and their influence on child behavioural development. This prospective study included 348 women with postpartum mental disorders who received dyadic treatment at a specialized mother-baby day clinic. Maternal symptoms of depression (EPDS), anxiety (STAI-T), overall psychological distress (BSI-GSI) as well as parenting sense of competence (PSOC) were assessed at admission, discharge, and 1-year follow-up, along with diagnostic classification at admission. At 1-year follow-up, mothers (<i>n</i> = 164) completed the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) to measure child behavioural problems. Maternal psychopathology and PSOC improved significantly from admission to discharge, with clinically meaningful effects. No additional improvements emerged from discharge to 1-year follow-up, except for a tentative reduction in anxiety symptoms. All outcome measures and outcome trajectories regarding anxiety symptoms and overall psychological distress varied by primary clinical diagnosis. Greater maternal symptom improvement from admission to 1-year follow-up was associated with fewer child behavioural problems. However, this effect was not found for symptom changes from admission to discharge when controlling for maternal symptoms at 1-year follow-up. Interaction-focused treatment in a mother-baby day clinic may be associated with clinically meaningful improvements in maternal mental health outcomes up to 1-year follow-up. These long-term improvements may also relate to less child behavioural problems.

There is no standard of care treatment other than radiation therapy. This study aimed to determine the safety, tolerability, and distribution of nanoliposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI) delivered via CED in patients with DIPG. Newly diagnosed DIPG patients > 2 years were eligible for enrollment. Dose level (DL) 1 and 2 were completed (DL1 = 2 mL of nal-IRI [20 mg/mL] DL2 = 3 mL of nal-IRI [20 mg/mL]). Nal-IRI was co-infused with gadoteridol via CED to achieve maximal tumor coverage. The distribution of infusate mixture was monitored with real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The study employed an accelerated dose escalation approach and transitioned to a conventional 3 + 3 design based on predefined rules. The study was terminated prematurely due to the discontinuation of drug supply by industry partner. Six patients (median age 10 years, range 5-40) underwent a total of 13 treatments (median 2, range 1-5/patient). Four grade 3 adverse events, (muscle weakness <i>n</i> = 2, dysarthria <i>n</i> = 1, and gait disturbance <i>n</i> = 1) were observed, including one dose-limiting toxicity (muscle weakness).

40575407,"Risk factors, predictive models, and general work ability trajectory in patients with glioma.","Glioma research has increasingly emphasized quality of life alongside traditional survival metrics, emphasizing functional outcomes, symptom burden, and social reintegration, including the ability to work. While previous studies focused on return-to-work rates, we assessed general work ability as a broader measure of work capacity. We aimed to develop predictive models for general work ability recovery, identify key risk factors, and explore long-term trajectories. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 342 patients with glioma (aged 18-64, WHO Grades 2-4) between March 2010 and December 2018. Work ability and symptoms were assessed using the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor Module (MDASI-BT), which was administered at months 1 and 3 postoperatively, then every three months up to 12 months, and at longer intervals thereafter.

40575350,Mediating Role of Trauma Connecting Psychiatric Family History and Adolescent Mental Health.,"Adolescent mental health is influenced by family history. Experiences of trauma also convey substantial risk for mental health challenges. Mediation of the association of family history with adolescent mental health by trauma experiences could be actionable and warrants evaluation. We sought to interrogate the mediating role of trauma in the association of family history of psychiatric disorders (FH) with adolescent general psychopathology, accounting for shared environment and genetics. The Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort was a cross-sectional study of participants ages 8 to 21 years with English fluency and in good medical health with characterization from November 2009 to December 2011.

Among 7840 participants, we tested associations of first-degree FH (category count [0-4]: psychosis, mood, suicide attempt, substance use), youth exposure to trauma, neighborhood environment (block-level geocoded socioeconomic indices), and genomic factor of polygenic scores for psychopathologies (depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar, cross-disorder) with adolescent general psychopathology modeled as p-factor. Association of FH with general psychopathology was assessed with structural equation modeling, querying for an indirect pathway via trauma, with stepwise accounting of genomics and shared environment, controlling for age and sex. Of 7840 participants, 31% had FH and 44% of youths reported trauma exposure. Trauma had substantial direct association with general psychopathology and consistently mediated more than 20% of variance from FH to psychopathology, accounting for neighborhood and genomic predisposition. Trauma exposures mediate a substantial portion of association between FH and adolescent psychopathology, an opportunity for transgenerational intervention.",Biological psychiatry global open science,2025.0,Barbara H Chaiyachati; Jamie L Catalano; Laura M Schultz; Laura Almasy; Elina Visoki; Jakob Seidlitz; Tyler M Moore; Jerome H Taylor; Monica E Calkins; Raquel E Gur; Ran Barzilay,adolescent mental health influence family history experience trauma convey substantial risk mental health challenge mediation association family history adolescent mental health trauma experience actionable warrant evaluation seek interrogate mediate role trauma association family history psychiatric disorder fh adolescent general psychopathology account shared environment genetic philadelphia neurodevelopmental cohort cross sectional study participant age 8 21 year english fluency good medical health characterization november 2009 december 2011 analysis report complete march 2023 february 2025 7840 participant test association degree fh category count 0 4 psychosis mood suicide attempt substance use youth exposure trauma neighborhood environment block level geocode socioeconomic index genomic factor polygenic score psychopathology depression posttraumatic stress disorder schizophrenia bipolar cross disorder adolescent general psychopathology model p factor association fh general psychopathology assess structural equation modeling query indirect pathway trauma stepwise accounting genomic shared environment control age sex 7840 participant 31 fh 44 youth report trauma exposure trauma substantial direct association general psychopathology consistently mediate 20 variance fh psychopathology account neighborhood genomic predisposition trauma exposure mediate substantial portion association fh adolescent psychopathology opportunity transgenerational intervention
40575349,Deconvolution-Based Transcriptomic Analysis in the Hippocampus Reveals Cell Type-Specific Risk Genes and Pathways Associated With Depression and Suicide.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent mental health condition with the highest associated suicide risk among major psychiatric disorders. Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms is crucial for assessing the risk of MDD and associated suicide. In this study, transcriptome-based deconvolution was applied to human postmortem hippocampal samples from nonpsychiatric control subjects (<i>n</i> = 29), subjects with MDD who died by means other than suicide (D-S; <i>n</i> = 15), and subjects with MDD who died by suicide (D+S; <i>n</i> = 29). A reference gene expression profile for deconvolution was established using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-Seq) analysis. The proportions of various cell types were assessed using the MuSiC2 package, and the cell type-specific gene expression was estimated from the bulk transcriptome using bMIND. Differential expression analysis using the deconvoluted expression profile was conducted to study cell type-specific gene regulation patterns in the hippocampi of patients with MDD who died by nonsuicidal or suicidal means. The snRNA-Seq analysis identified 11 major cell types in the hippocampus, which were consolidated into 5 primary categories: pyramidal, GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acidergic), microglia, macroglia, and endothelial cells. Variability in the cell-type proportions was noted among the sample groups, and the gene expression deconvolution showed distinct patterns among cell types and sample groups. Differential expression analysis at the cell-type level identified more differentially expressed genes than the bulk transcriptome, with variations across comparisons and cell types. Notably, pyramidal neurons displayed significant contrasts between D-S and D+S subjects; the former group exhibited enrichment in cytoskeleton-related pathways and molecular functions, while the latter demonstrated a prevalence of immune-related terms. The distinct cell type-specific transcriptomic patterns, gene networks, and pathways reveal critical vulnerabilities associated with suicidality in individuals with MDD. These findings underscore the potential for targeted interventions aimed at these specific molecular pathways to mitigate suicide risk in individuals with depression.",Biological psychiatry global open science,2025.0,Aleena Francis; Bhaskar Roy; Yogesh Dwivedi,major depressive disorder mdd prevalent mental health condition high associate suicide risk major psychiatric disorder understand molecular cellular mechanism crucial assess risk mdd associated suicide study transcriptome base deconvolution apply human postmortem hippocampal sample nonpsychiatric control subject < > n</i > = 29 subject mdd die mean suicide d s < > n</i > = 15 subject mdd die suicide d+s < > n</i > = 29 reference gene expression profile deconvolution establish single nucleus rna sequence snrna seq analysis proportion cell type assess music2 package cell type specific gene expression estimate bulk transcriptome bmind differential expression analysis deconvolute expression profile conduct study cell type specific gene regulation pattern hippocampi patient mdd die nonsuicidal suicidal mean snrna seq analysis identify 11 major cell type hippocampus consolidate 5 primary category pyramidal gabaergic gamma aminobutyric acidergic microglia macroglia endothelial cell variability cell type proportion note sample group gene expression deconvolution show distinct pattern cell type sample group differential expression analysis cell type level identify differentially express gene bulk transcriptome variation comparison cell type notably pyramidal neuron display significant contrast d s d+s subject group exhibit enrichment cytoskeleton relate pathway molecular function demonstrate prevalence immune relate term distinct cell type specific transcriptomic pattern gene network pathway reveal critical vulnerability associate suicidality individual mdd finding underscore potential target intervention aim specific molecular pathway mitigate suicide risk individual depression
40575340,"Gastroparesis, a diabetic complication causing further, even serious, complications: How to prevent its worsening?","Gastroparesis is a severe diabetic complication, caused by a progressive multifactorial enteric neuropathy. To make an early diagnosis in patients at risk of diabetic gastroparesis is crucial for slow down its progression towards full-blown disease source of further complications and requesting effective, but unsafe, drugs as well as invasive surgical treatments. This aim can be achieved by detecting its first signal represented by the gastric emptying (GE) delay, by using, among the tests to measure GE, the simple, safe, reliable, and easily available one, that is real-time ultrasonography, possibly done annually. Once the GE delay has been identified, it is necessary to evaluate with endoluminal functional lumen imaging probe or manometry whether it depends on pylorospasm, which should be treated by means of non-surgical endoscopic therapies. If, instead, it depends on initial gastropathy, detected by electrogastrograhic body surface gastric mapping, it should be treated with the safest prokinetic drugs and with the newly emerging treatments, thus distancing heavy medical and surgical treatments, while waiting for future solutions.",World journal of gastroenterology,2025.0,Mauro Bortolotti,gastroparesis severe diabetic complication cause progressive multifactorial enteric neuropathy early diagnosis patient risk diabetic gastroparesis crucial slow progression blow disease source complication request effective unsafe drug invasive surgical treatment aim achieve detect signal represent gastric empty ge delay test measure ge simple safe reliable easily available real time ultrasonography possibly annually ge delay identify necessary evaluate endoluminal functional luman imaging probe manometry depend pylorospasm treat mean non surgical endoscopic therapy instead depend initial gastropathy detect electrogastrograhic body surface gastric mapping treat safe prokinetic drug newly emerge treatment distance heavy medical surgical treatment wait future solution
40575333,Endothelin A receptor in nociceptors is essential for persistent mechanical pain in a chronic pancreatitis of mouse model.,"Chronic pancreatitis (CP) accompanied with persistent abdominal pain represents a major clinical challenge for the symptom management in patients. Although with clear involvement of neuropathy, the detailed mechanisms underlying pain hypersensitivity associated with CP are not totally clear. The endothelin system has been reported to contribute to chronic pain and chronic inflammatory settings, and is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of chronic pain. To evaluate the role of nociceptor-specific endothelin A receptor (ETAR) in pain hypersensitivity in a CP mouse model and its potential contributing mechanisms. Oral gavage delivery of dibutyltin dichloride (DBTC) was used to induce CP in mice. A conditional knockout (CKO) strain which specifically delete ETAR in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptive neurons was generated. Abdominal pain hypersensitivity associated with CP and other behaviors were evaluated. The size of mouse gallbladder was measured and pancreatic histopathology was examined to validate the CP model. Calcitonin gene-related peptide expression and immune cells in the innervated DRGs and spinal cord were also examined. Calcium imaging in dissociated DRG neurons was performed to investigate the excitability of affected nociceptive neurons. Specific deletion of endothelin receptor type A gene in nociceptive DRG neurons did not affect basal abdominal thermal and mechanical pain threshold in mice. Abdominal mechanical pain hypersensitivity was persistent in DBTC-treated WT mice but was significantly reduced in DBTC-treated CKO mice. DBTC treatment did not affect mouse nociceptive responses to heat and cold stimuli, as well as motor functions and anxiety-like behaviors of mice. DBTC treatment induced severe pancreatic inflammation and obvious gallbladder enlargement in wild type (WT) mice, but less in CKO mice. DBTC-induced increase of calcitonin gene-related peptide- and induction of brown adipocytes 1-positive signals in the DRG and spinal cord in WT mice were remarkably attenuated in CKO mice. DRG neurons from CKO mice exhibited less excitability and sensitivity in response to endothelin-1 exposure than those from WT mice. DBTC intragastric administration in mice produced a convenient and reliable animal model for studying abdominal pain associated with CP.

40575269,Management of patients with acromegaly in clinical practice in the gulf countries: a Delphi consensus survey.,"Acromegaly management practices in the Gulf region lack standardized guidelines, leading to variability in care. This study aimed to establish evidence-based regional consensus recommendations to address clinical challenges and align management with local healthcare resources. A three-round Delphi consensus survey was conducted among 15 endocrinology experts from six Gulf countries. Forty-six statements across six domains-primary treatment, pre-surgery treatment with somatostatin analogs (SSAs), second-line therapy, radiotherapy, post-surgery follow-up, and long-term management-were evaluated. Consensus was predefined as ≥66.8% agreement. Strong consensus was achieved on surgical resection as first-line therapy for eligible patients (100% agreement), with referrals to multidisciplinary centers emphasized (93.8%). Preoperative SSAs were endorsed to reduce surgical/anesthesia risks in high-risk patients (93.8%). For second-line management, watchful waiting for asymptomatic patients with mildly elevated insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) (93.8%) and combination therapy (where feasible) were supported. Radiotherapy received unanimous agreement for specific cases. Structured post-surgical follow-up protocols, including biochemical testing timelines and remission criteria, were established. Long-term monitoring emphasized individualized risk assessment. These guidelines provide a regionally tailored framework for acromegaly management, prioritizing surgery as the cornerstone of treatment while integrating adjuvant therapies and follow-up strategies aligned with Gulf healthcare infrastructures. The consensus reflects pragmatic adaptations to resource availability, such as endorsing watchful waiting in specific contexts. While acknowledging limitations such as potential expert bias, these consensus guidelines provide a framework for standardizing acromegaly care across the Gulf countries, with emphasis on surgical intervention as the cornerstone of treatment while recognizing the importance of adjunctive therapies.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2025.0,Mussa H Almalki; Tarik Elhadd; Khaled M AlDahmani; Aishah Ekhzaimy; Abdullah Alqanaei; Hasan Frookh; Arwa Alyamani; Osamah Hakami; Zeinab Dabbous; Zaina Rohani; Wael Almistehi; Hazem Aljumah; Abdulla Alfutaisi; Alaaeldin Bashier; Moeber Mahzari,acromegaly management practice gulf region lack standardize guideline lead variability care study aim establish evidence base regional consensus recommendation address clinical challenge align management local healthcare resource round delphi consensus survey conduct 15 endocrinology expert gulf country statement domain primary treatment pre surgery treatment somatostatin analogs ssa second line therapy radiotherapy post surgery follow long term management evaluate consensus predefine ≥66.8 agreement strong consensus achieve surgical resection line therapy eligible patient 100 agreement referral multidisciplinary center emphasize 93.8 preoperative ssa endorse reduce surgical anesthesia risk high risk patient 93.8 second line management watchful wait asymptomatic patient mildly elevate insulin like growth factor-1 igf-1 93.8 combination therapy feasible support radiotherapy receive unanimous agreement specific case structured post surgical follow protocol include biochemical testing timeline remission criterion establish long term monitoring emphasize individualized risk assessment guideline provide regionally tailor framework acromegaly management prioritize surgery cornerstone treatment integrate adjuvant therapy follow strategy align gulf healthcare infrastructure consensus reflect pragmatic adaptation resource availability endorse watchful wait specific context acknowledge limitation potential expert bias consensus guideline provide framework standardize acromegaly care gulf country emphasis surgical intervention cornerstone treatment recognize importance adjunctive therapy
40575267,Methylation and gene expression patterns in adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma highlight a panel of genes associated with disease progression-free survival.,"Over the past decade, advancements in next-generation sequencing have significantly enhanced our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas (ACP). This study integrated methylome and transcriptome analyses in ACP samples to explore the potential interplay between DNA methylation and RNA expression signatures for diagnostic and prognostic applications in ACP patients. This cross-sectional study evaluated clinicopathological features, DNA methylation, and gene expression profiles in 15 patients with ACP (33% women, age range: 3-55 years, 53% diagnosed before 18 years) treated at Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of São Paulo. Multidimensional scaling and principal component analysis identified two distinct clusters (ACP-A: n=9, ACP-B: n=6) with consistent composition across DNA methylation and gene expression profiles. While most clinical and histopathological characteristics were similar between clusters, ACP-A exhibited a longer median progression-free survival. ACP-B showed a higher prevalence of hypomethylated probes in CGI sites, and 63% of differentially methylated positions (DMPs) located in gene body regions. Differential methylation patterns were categorized into Methyl-Set1 (hypomethylated in ACP-A and hypermethylated in ACP-B) and Methyl-Set2 (hypermethylated in ACP-A and hypomethylated in ACP-B). Clustering analyses based on the methylation levels of probes and expression levels of the stringently filtered 212- and 37-gene sets further confirmed these two distinct ACP subgroups. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted key roles in synaptic modulation, nervous system development, cell adhesion, as well as pathways linked to RAS signaling, GTPase activity, and membrane potential regulation. Although clinical characteristics were largely comparable between the clusters, ACP-B patients exhibited shorter median progression-free survival, suggesting a more aggressive phenotype. The higher prevalence of hypomethylation in ACP-B indicates increased transcriptional activation, potentially driving tumor aggressiveness. The strong concordance between methylation and transcriptomic data in the 212- and 37-gene sets underscores their potential as a clinically relevant molecular biomarker panel.

40575266,Psychological symptoms in perimenarcheal adolescents: association with PCOS risk factors.,"PCOS is linked with disproportionately high rates of depression and anxiety that significantly compromise quality of life and pose problems for treatment eligibility and adherence. The overarching objective of the proposed manuscript is to define the presence and severity of psychological symptoms in peri-menarcheal adolescents, and their association with well-described risk-factors for future PCOS. Fifty-two pre- and early post-menarcheal participants underwent a non-fasting blood draw to measure reproductive hormones (Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Total Testosterone, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) and HbA1c, anthropometry, menstrual history (if post-menarcheal), and a series of surveys to evaluate depression (CES-DC), anxiety (MASC) and, as a novel approach, rumination, which is a transdiagnostic psychological process and early prodromal risk for psychological disorders. Parents/legal guardians completed a demographics survey. Random Forest analysis was used to predict depression, anxiety, and rumination from a predetermined set of variables in this participant sample. The overall R<sup>2</sup> for depression, anxiety, and rumination from the random forest model were 0.557, 0.555, and 0.597, respectively, suggesting overall good explanatory power for psychological outcomes. Parent education (Portion Sum of Squares (SS) = 11.4%) followed by AMH (Portion SS = 10.9%) and waist-hip-ratio (WHR) (Portion SS = 9.2%) were the most important variables in predicting depression. LH: FSH ratio was the most important variable in the dataset used to differentiate participants along the observed anxiety score continuum (Portion SS = 0.112 (11%) followed by HbA1c (Portion SS = 8.1%) and WHR (Portion SS = 7.9%). SHBG was the most frequently identified variable to differentiate participants reporting rumination (Portion SS = 13.3%) followed by Free Androgen Index (Portion SS = 6.9%) and WHR (Portion SS = 6.9%).

40575260,Association between glycemic variability and acute kidney injury incidence in patients with cerebral infarction: an analysis of the MIMIC-IV database.,"Glycemic variability (GV) is an increasingly important predictive indicator of vascular occlusion-related complications. Studies have demonstrated that a higher GV is associated with poor outcomes in patients with cerebral infarction (CI). The prognostic utility of GV in CI patients for predicting acute kidney injury (AKI) remains inadequately characterized. This investigation systematically examines the pathophysiological relationship between acute glycemic fluctuations and AKI development in CI populations, with particular emphasis on temporal patterns of glucose dysregulation. This retrospective cohort analysis utilized data from the MIMIC-IV database, categorizing CI patients into quartiles based on GV metrics. Primary outcomes included AKI incidence and renal replacement therapy (RRT) initiation, with in-hospital mortality designated as the secondary endpoint. Analytical methodologies employed Kaplan-Meier survival curves with log-rank testing, multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression, and logistic regression modeling to evaluate GV-AKI associations while controlling for critical confounders. The analytical cohort comprised 3,343 critically ill individuals extracted from the MIMIC-IV database. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis demonstrated progressively elevated cumulative risks of AKI development, RRT requirement, and in-hospital mortality among individuals with heightened GV. Following multivariable adjustment, logistic regression models and Cox proportional hazards analyses confirmed GV as an independent predictor of AKI progression, RRT dependency, and mortality risk in cerebral infarction patients. This investigation identifies GV as an independent prognostic determinant for AKI development in cerebral infarction patients.

40575094,Impact of exposure of particulate matters on stroke risk: exploring the influence of physical activity among middle-aged and older adults in China.,"Particulate matter is increasingly recognized as a critical environmental risk factor for stroke, particularly among older populations. Although physical activity confers substantial cerebrovascular benefits, it remains unclear how it might mediate or moderate the adverse influence of different sizes of particulate matter on stroke risk. A prospective cohort analysis was conducted using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, which enrolled adults aged ≥45 years from diverse regions across mainland China. Annual mean concentrations of PM<sub>1</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and PM<sub>10</sub> were estimated from 2010 to 2020 based on geocoded residential information. Incident stroke cases were identified through self-reported diagnoses and hospitalization records. Binary logistic mixed-effect models examined the associations between exposures to PM<sub>1</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and PM<sub>10</sub>, respectively, and stroke risk. Subgroup and mediation analyses explored the roles of physical activity, gender, and job status. Of 13,573 participants, 540 (4.0%) experienced an incident stroke during follow-up. After full adjustment for covariates, each 10 μg/m3 increment in PM<sub>1</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and PM<sub>10</sub> was significantly associated with higher stroke odds (odds ratios = 1.08, 1.05, and 1.04, all <i>P</i> < 0.01). Stronger relationships were observed among physically inactive individuals, women, and those who were unemployed or engaged in agricultural work. Mediation analysis indicated that physical activity accounted for ~19.6% of the detrimental effect of elevated PM<sub>2.5</sub> on stroke likelihood, suggesting that reduced engagement in physical activity constitutes an important pathway through which finer particulate pollution exerts its harmful impact. Greater exposure to PM<sub>1</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and PM<sub>10</sub> substantially elevates the risk of stroke among middle-aged and older adults in China, especially in subgroups characterized by lower levels of physical activity and socioeconomic disadvantage. Physical activity partially mediates the effect of PM<sub>2.5</sub> on stroke risk, underscoring the need for integrated public health interventions that address both environmental pollution and modifiable lifestyle factors. Future studies utilizing high-resolution exposure assessments and objective health measures could further elucidate causal mechanisms and guide strategies to mitigate pollution-related stroke.",Frontiers in public health,2025.0,Zhongning Fang; Pengwei Hou; Chenzhu Cai; Xieli Guo; Mingfa Cai,"particulate matter increasingly recognize critical environmental risk factor stroke particularly old population physical activity confer substantial cerebrovascular benefit remain unclear mediate moderate adverse influence different size particulate matter stroke risk prospective cohort analysis conduct datum china health retirement longitudinal study enrol adult age ≥45 year diverse region mainland china annual mean concentration pm < sub>1</sub > pm < sub>2.5</sub > pm < sub>10</sub > estimate 2010 2020 base geocode residential information incident stroke case identify self report diagnosis hospitalization record binary logistic mixed effect model examine association exposure pm < sub>1</sub > pm < sub>2.5</sub > pm < sub>10</sub > respectively stroke risk subgroup mediation analysis explore role physical activity gender job status 13,573 participant 540 4.0 experience incident stroke follow adjustment covariate 10 μg m3 increment pm < sub>1</sub > pm < sub>2.5</sub > pm < sub>10</sub > significantly associate high stroke odd odd ratio = 1.08 1.05 1.04 < > p</i > < 0.01 strong relationship observe physically inactive individual woman unemployed engage agricultural work mediation analysis indicate physical activity account ~19.6 detrimental effect elevated pm < sub>2.5</sub > stroke likelihood suggest reduce engagement physical activity constitute important pathway fine particulate pollution exert harmful impact great exposure pm < sub>1</sub > pm < sub>2.5</sub > pm < sub>10</sub > substantially elevate risk stroke middle aged old adult china especially subgroup characterize low level physical activity socioeconomic disadvantage physical activity partially mediate effect pm < sub>2.5</sub > stroke risk underscore need integrated public health intervention address environmental pollution modifiable lifestyle factor future study utilize high resolution exposure assessment objective health measure elucidate causal mechanism guide strategy mitigate pollution relate stroke"

The review included observational studies, clinical trials, narrative reviews, guidelines and meta-analyses published in the past 10 years. Additional references were identified through manual searches of relevant bibliographies. The global prevalence of PHH is estimated to range between 0.072% and 9%, with PHH accounting for 93% of all HH cases. Whilst the precise pathophysiology remains unclear, PHH is believed to result from sympathetic overactivity, whereas SHH is associated with endocrine, neurological, infectious, malignant and medication-induced causes. PHH is diagnosed clinically and distinguishing between primary and secondary forms is essential. Management options vary based on severity, ranging from topical therapies (antiperspirants, anticholinergics), systemic medications (oral anticholinergics, adrenergic modulators), device-based interventions (iontophoresis, microwave thermolysis), injectable therapies (botulinum toxin) and surgical approaches (sympathectomy, excision, liposuction/curettage). Whilst these interventions can significantly improve symptoms and quality of life, long-term efficacy, recurrence and adverse effects remain concerns. PHH significantly impacts the quality life of patients contributing to both physical discomfort and psychosocial distress. An individualized, multi-modal approach is crucial to optimizing management. Further research is warranted to refine existing therapies and evaluate emerging treatment modalities for improved long-term outcomes.",Drugs in context,2025.0,Mahan Maazi; Alexander Kc Leung; Joseph M Lam,hyperhidrosis hh condition characterize excessive sweating physiological need thermoregulation hh classify primary idiopathic hyperhidrosis phh secondary hyperhidrosis shh associate underlying medical condition medication systemic disorder narrative review provide update overview phh focus epidemiology aetiopathogenesis clinical manifestation diagnostic approach current management strategy particularly highlight pharmacological procedural treatment option literature search conduct february 2025 ovid medline embase cochrane central register controlled trials central key term hyperhidrosis review include observational study clinical trial narrative review guideline meta analysis publish past 10 year additional reference identify manual search relevant bibliography global prevalence phh estimate range 0.072 9 phh account 93 hh case whilst precise pathophysiology remain unclear phh believe result sympathetic overactivity shh associate endocrine neurological infectious malignant medication induce cause phh diagnose clinically distinguish primary secondary form essential management option vary base severity range topical therapy antiperspirant anticholinergic systemic medication oral anticholinergic adrenergic modulator device base intervention iontophoresis microwave thermolysis injectable therapy botulinum toxin surgical approach sympathectomy excision liposuction curettage whilst intervention significantly improve symptom quality life long term efficacy recurrence adverse effect remain concern phh significantly impact quality life patient contribute physical discomfort psychosocial distress individualized multi modal approach crucial optimize management research warrant refine exist therapy evaluate emerge treatment modality improved long term outcome
40574974,Higher healthcare use before paediatric multiple sclerosis onset: a nationwide cohort study.,"Evidence of increased healthcare use occurring before paediatric-onset multiple sclerosis presentation suggests a prodromal phase. However, little is known of its duration or features, and few studies have accessed a clinical cohort to examine the period before symptom onset. We compared annual rates of healthcare use before paediatric multiple sclerosis onset in clinical and administrative cohorts versus matched non-multiple sclerosis cohorts. We identified persons with paediatric-onset multiple sclerosis from the Swedish Multiple Sclerosis registry and population-based administrative data using a validated algorithm requiring ≥3 hospital or outpatient multiple sclerosis diagnostic codes recorded on separate dates. The index date was multiple sclerosis symptom onset, as recorded in the multiple sclerosis registry by a neurologist (clinical cohort) or the earliest demyelinating disease-related International Classification of Diseases code (administrative cohort). Individuals with age at index <18 years were matched with up to five individuals from the general population on sex, birth year, county of residence at the index date and residency time. Healthcare use was measured as hospital/outpatient diagnoses (International Classification of Diseases chapters) and prescription drug classes (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system, 2nd level). Yearly rates of hospital and outpatient visits (up to 17 years pre-index) and prescription fills (up to 14 years pre-index) were compared using Quasi-Poisson regression. The clinical/administrative cohorts included 233/206 paediatric-onset multiple sclerosis and 1151/1011 matched individuals, with a mean age at the index of 16 years (standard deviation: 2) in all four groups. In both cohorts, individuals with paediatric-onset multiple sclerosis exhibited elevated healthcare use predominantly 1-10 years pre-index, including, for example, higher prescriptions filled for corticosteroids for dermatological use (rate ratio range: 2.61-3.91) and outpatient visits for ill-defined signs/symptoms (rate ratio range: 2.17-8.64) and unassigned ICD codes (rate ratio range: 2.20-4.17). In the year pre-index, individuals with paediatric-onset multiple sclerosis in both cohorts exhibited higher rates of outpatient visits for neoplasms, nervous system disorders, sense organ conditions, ill-defined signs/symptoms and 'other health system contact' (rate ratio range: 2.05-18.00). In the same year, the clinical cohort also had higher rates of prescription fills for 'other gynecologicals' (4.08, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-16.09), and the administrative cohort had higher rates for prescriptions filled across eight drug classes (rate ratio range: 1.56-6.49). Healthcare use was higher primarily in the 1-10 years before paediatric-onset multiple sclerosis versus a matched cohort, suggestive of a prodromal phase. During this period, the paediatric-onset multiple sclerosis cohort was more often identified as having ill-defined signs/symptoms, neoplasms and skin-related issues.",Brain communications,2025.0,Kyla Anne McKay; Ali Manouchehrinia; Feng Zhu; Yinshan Zhao; Ruth Ann Marrie; Colleen Jean Maxwell; Jan Hillert; Helen Tremlett,evidence increase healthcare use occur paediatric onset multiple sclerosis presentation suggest prodromal phase little know duration feature study access clinical cohort examine period symptom onset compare annual rate healthcare use paediatric multiple sclerosis onset clinical administrative cohort versus match non multiple sclerosis cohort identify person paediatric onset multiple sclerosis swedish multiple sclerosis registry population base administrative datum validate algorithm require ≥3 hospital outpatient multiple sclerosis diagnostic code record separate date index date multiple sclerosis symptom onset record multiple sclerosis registry neurologist clinical cohort early demyelinate disease relate international classification diseases code administrative cohort individual age index < 18 year match individual general population sex birth year county residence index date residency time healthcare use measure hospital outpatient diagnosis international classification diseases chapter prescription drug class anatomical therapeutic chemical classification system 2nd level yearly rate hospital outpatient visit 17 year pre index prescription fill 14 year pre index compare quasi poisson regression clinical administrative cohort include 233/206 paediatric onset multiple sclerosis 1151/1011 matched individual mean age index 16 year standard deviation 2 group cohort individual paediatric onset multiple sclerosis exhibit elevated healthcare use predominantly 1 10 year pre index include example high prescription fill corticosteroid dermatological use rate ratio range 2.61 3.91 outpatient visit ill define sign symptom rate ratio range 2.17 8.64 unassigne icd code rate ratio range 2.20 4.17 year pre index individual paediatric onset multiple sclerosis cohort exhibit high rate outpatient visit neoplasm nervous system disorder sense organ condition ill define sign symptom health system contact rate ratio range 2.05 18.00 year clinical cohort high rate prescription fill gynecological 4.08 95 confidence interval 1.04 16.09 administrative cohort high rate prescription fill drug class rate ratio range 1.56 6.49 healthcare use high primarily 1 10 year paediatric onset multiple sclerosis versus match cohort suggestive prodromal phase period paediatric onset multiple sclerosis cohort identify have ill define sign symptom neoplasm skin relate issue
40574970,Lesion distribution and network mapping in dyskinetic cerebral palsy.,"Dyskinetic cerebral palsy encompasses a group of predominantly perinatally acquired complex motor disorders that present with dystonia and/or choreoathetosis and are frequently associated with brain lesions in neuroimaging. Recently, lesion network mapping provided a tool to redefine neurological disorders as circuitopathies. Elucidating the common networks impacted by lesions in this condition could pave the way to identify new targets for neuromodulatory therapeutic approaches. In this study, we aim to assess lesion distribution in dyskinetic cerebral palsy and identify a related functional network derived from lesions. Here, we review the literature of MRI findings in dyskinetic cerebral palsy and perform literature-based lesion network mapping. Articles reporting conventional MRI findings clearly attributable to affected patients were included for review. Imaging findings and their anatomical distribution were extracted and quantified according to an established MRI classification system for cerebral palsy. Reviewed articles were searched for figures depicting lesions and these were traced onto a paediatric template. Whole-brain functional connectivity from lesions causing dyskinetic cerebral palsy was calculated using a paediatric resting-state functional MRI connectome. Individual maps were thresholded and later overlapped to derive a common network map associated with dyskinetic cerebral palsy. Results were contrasted with two control datasets for spatial specificity. Review of 48 selected articles revealed that grey matter injury predominated (51%), followed by white matter injury (28%). In 16% of cases MRI was normal. Subcortical lesions affected the thalamus, pallidum and putamen in >40% of reported patients, respectively. Figures available from 23 literature cases were used to calculate the lesion netwok map of dyskinetic cerebral palsy. The lesion-derived map revealed functional connectivity to a wide network including the brainstem, cerebellum, basal ganglia, cingulate and sensorimotor cortices. The strongest connectivity was found for the motor thalamus. This study confirms subcortical grey matter lesions as the most common MRI finding in dyskinetic cerebral palsy. The neural network identified with lesion network mapping includes areas previously implicated in hyperkinetic disorders and highlights the motor thalamus as a common network node. These results should be validated and their therapeutic implications explored in prospective trials.",Brain communications,2025.0,Ana Luísa de Almeida Marcelino; Bassam Al-Fatly; Mehmet S Tuncer; Ingeborg Krägeloh-Mann; Anne Koy; Andrea A Kühn,dyskinetic cerebral palsy encompass group predominantly perinatally acquire complex motor disorder present dystonia and/or choreoathetosis frequently associate brain lesion neuroimaging recently lesion network mapping provide tool redefine neurological disorder circuitopathie elucidate common network impact lesion condition pave way identify new target neuromodulatory therapeutic approach study aim assess lesion distribution dyskinetic cerebral palsy identify related functional network derive lesion review literature mri finding dyskinetic cerebral palsy perform literature base lesion network mapping article report conventional mri finding clearly attributable affected patient include review image finding anatomical distribution extract quantify accord established mri classification system cerebral palsy review article search figure depict lesion trace paediatric template brain functional connectivity lesion cause dyskinetic cerebral palsy calculate paediatric resting state functional mri connectome individual map thresholde later overlap derive common network map associate dyskinetic cerebral palsy result contrast control dataset spatial specificity review 48 select article reveal grey matter injury predominate 51 follow white matter injury 28 16 case mri normal subcortical lesion affect thalamus pallidum putaman > 40 reported patient respectively figure available 23 literature case calculate lesion netwok map dyskinetic cerebral palsy lesion derive map reveal functional connectivity wide network include brainstem cerebellum basal ganglia cingulate sensorimotor cortex strong connectivity find motor thalamus study confirm subcortical grey matter lesion common mri finding dyskinetic cerebral palsy neural network identify lesion network mapping include area previously implicate hyperkinetic disorder highlight motor thalamus common network node result validate therapeutic implication explore prospective trial
40574928,Luscan-Lumish syndrome: A case report.,"Luscan-Lumish syndrome (LLS) is a rare genetic congenital anomaly syndrome characterised by neurodevelopmental disorders, including delayed psychomotor development, behavioral difficulties, relative or true macrocephaly and, in individual cases, ocular abnormalities. This paper aims to present the case of a child with ocular abnormalities associated with LLS. A 10-year-old girl born at 40 weeks gestation with features of dysmorphia, neurodevelopmental disorders, genetically confirmed LLS, convergent strabismus and suspected congenital glaucoma. Eye examination, ultrasound, optical coherence tomography (OCT), perimetry and electrophysiological study [pattern visually evoked potentials (VEP)] were performed. Best-corrected distance visual acuity was 0.5 in the right eye (correction -1.0 Dsph, -1.0 Dcyl, axis 180°) and 0.62 in the left eye (correction -2.0 Dsph). Near visual acuity (Snellen Chart) with the above correction was -0.5 D. A cycloplegic refraction test yielded -1.25 Dsph, -1.25 Dcyl, axis 165° in the right eye, and -2.0 Dsph, -0.25 Dcyl, axis 154° in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was 15 mmHg in both eyes. OCT of the maculae showed no abnormalities. In both eyes, the average ganglion cell layer and inner plexiform layer thickness was 73 μm. OCT of the optic nerve disc showed an average retinal nerve fibre layer thickness of 89 μm in the right eye and 81 μm in the left eye, with symmetry of 90%. The rim area was 1.59 mm<sup>2</sup> and 1.74 mm<sup>2</sup> in the right and left eye, respectively. The disc area was 2.77 mm² in the right eye and 2.89 mm<sup>2</sup> in the left. The average cup-to-disc ratio was 0.64 in the right eye and 0.62 in the left eye. Ocular ultrasound depicted single extra echoes inside the vitreous chamber; otherwise, there were no abnormalities. Right and left eyeball lengths were 24.59 mm and 24.51 mm, respectively. Kinetic perimetry revealed no visual field defects, while static testing showed single relative scotomas. The mean defect was 4.7 dB in the right and 2.6 dB in the left eye. The loss variance values were 4.8 and 3.8 dB for the right and left eye, respectively. Pattern VEP test revealed normal values of P100 Latency. Wave amplitude in the right eye was 50% at a visual angle of 1.0° and 30% at 15'. Due to the rarity of LLS, it seems interesting to present the child ophthalmological examination with changes in the electrophysiological examination. Although eye abnormalities are infrequently described in children with LLS, the patients should undergo eye examinations, especially as they may have central nervous system anomalies that may give rise to visual impairments. Generally, children with genetically determined congenital syndromes should receive regular ophthalmic check-ups for a thorough evaluation of the eyes and prognosis of the development of visual function.",World journal of clinical cases,2025.0,Bogumiła Wójcik-Niklewska; Erita Filipek,luscan lumish syndrome lls rare genetic congenital anomaly syndrome characterise neurodevelopmental disorder include delay psychomotor development behavioral difficulty relative true macrocephaly individual case ocular abnormality paper aim present case child ocular abnormality associate lls 10 year old girl bear 40 week gestation feature dysmorphia neurodevelopmental disorder genetically confirm lls convergent strabismus suspect congenital glaucoma eye examination ultrasound optical coherence tomography oct perimetry electrophysiological study pattern visually evoke potential vep perform well correct distance visual acuity 0.5 right eye correction -1.0 dsph -1.0 dcyl axis 180 ° 0.62 left eye correction -2.0 dsph near visual acuity snellen chart correction -0.5 d. cycloplegic refraction test yield -1.25 dsph -1.25 dcyl axis 165 ° right eye -2.0 dsph -0.25 dcyl axis 154 ° left eye intraocular pressure 15 mmhg eye oct maculae show abnormality eye average ganglion cell layer inner plexiform layer thickness 73 μm oct optic nerve disc show average retinal nerve fibre layer thickness 89 μm right eye 81 μm left eye symmetry 90 rim area 1.59 mm < sup>2</sup > 1.74 mm < sup>2</sup > right leave eye respectively disc area 2.77 mm² right eye 2.89 mm < sup>2</sup > left average cup disc ratio 0.64 right eye 0.62 left eye ocular ultrasound depict single extra echo inside vitreous chamber abnormality right leave eyeball length 24.59 mm 24.51 mm respectively kinetic perimetry reveal visual field defect static testing show single relative scotoma mean defect 4.7 db right 2.6 db left eye loss variance value 4.8 3.8 db right leave eye respectively pattern vep test reveal normal value p100 latency wave amplitude right eye 50 visual angle 1.0 ° 30 15 rarity lls interesting present child ophthalmological examination change electrophysiological examination eye abnormality infrequently describe child lls patient undergo eye examination especially central nervous system anomaly rise visual impairment generally child genetically determine congenital syndrome receive regular ophthalmic check up thorough evaluation eye prognosis development visual function
40574926,Refractory Crohn's disease complicated with Guillain-Barré syndrome: A case report.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises a group of chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders, including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis, with uncertain etiologies. The natural course of IBD can be accompanied by extraintestinal manifestations involving the skin, mucous membranes, musculoskeletal structures, eyes, cardiovascular system and nervous system. Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a type of peripheral neuropathy. However, the etiology and pathogenesis of IBD combined with GBS are unclear, and only a few clinical cases have been reported. Here, we report a case of refractory CD complicated by GBS and review the previous literature to improve the understanding of these diseases. A 34-year-old man had a 9-year history of refractory CD. He became unresponsive to multiple drugs and experienced recurrent intestinal fistulas. After several abdominal surgeries and treatment with ustekinumab, he achieved clinical remission. Unfortunately, he developed GBS during maintenance treatment with ustekinumab. According to previous reports, in some patients with IBD combined with GBS, GBS may be a comorbidity, an extraintestinal manifestation of IBD, or an adverse reaction to IBD therapeutic drugs. After a comprehensive evaluation, we suspected that GBS might have been a comorbidity in this patient. To avoid fatal disease relapse after medication discontinuation, we concluded that ustekinumab should not be withdrawn. On the basis of a joint decision between doctors and the patient, we decided to continue maintenance treatment with ustekinumab along with intravenous immunoglobulin, dexamethasone and traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture, which resulted in a steady improvement in his GBS symptoms and sustained remission of CD. When IBD is complicated by a neurological disease, it is first necessary to analyze the patient's condition and then choose the corresponding treatment strategy. If the neurological disease is a specific comorbidity, treatment of both IBD and the comorbid disease should be considered. For IBD patients with extraintestinal manifestations involving the nervous system, neurological manifestations tend to resolve when the active IBD is controlled. When an adverse drug reaction is suspected, the medication should be discontinued, and symptomatic treatment should be administered.",World journal of clinical cases,2025.0,A-Niu Liu; Jia-Yi Yang; Xing-Yu Chen; Shan-Shan Wu; Se-Niu Ji Zhi; Shu-Mei Zheng,inflammatory bowel disease ibd comprise group chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disorder include crohn disease cd ulcerative colitis uncertain etiology natural course ibd accompany extraintestinal manifestation involve skin mucous membrane musculoskeletal structure eye cardiovascular system nervous system guillain barré syndrome gbs type peripheral neuropathy etiology pathogenesis ibd combine gbs unclear clinical case report report case refractory cd complicate gbs review previous literature improve understanding disease 34 year old man 9 year history refractory cd unresponsive multiple drug experience recurrent intestinal fistula abdominal surgery treatment ustekinumab achieve clinical remission unfortunately develop gbs maintenance treatment ustekinumab accord previous report patient ibd combine gbs gbs comorbidity extraintestinal manifestation ibd adverse reaction ibd therapeutic drug comprehensive evaluation suspect gbs comorbidity patient avoid fatal disease relapse medication discontinuation conclude ustekinumab withdraw basis joint decision doctor patient decide continue maintenance treatment ustekinumab intravenous immunoglobulin dexamethasone traditional chinese medicine acupuncture result steady improvement gbs symptom sustain remission cd ibd complicate neurological disease necessary analyze patient condition choose correspond treatment strategy neurological disease specific comorbidity treatment ibd comorbid disease consider ibd patient extraintestinal manifestation involve nervous system neurological manifestation tend resolve active ibd control adverse drug reaction suspect medication discontinue symptomatic treatment administer
40574857,Acute exacerbation of anti-Ha antibody-positive antisynthetase syndrome-associated interstitial lung disease: a case report.,"Anti-synthetase syndrome (ASS) is a rare autoimmune myopathy, frequently associated with interstitial lung disease, and is characterized by the presence of anti-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (ARS) antibodies. However, there have been limited reports of cases exhibiting positive anti-Ha antibodies. This study presents a retrospective analysis of the clinical data from a patient with an acute exacerbation of ASS who tested positive for anti-Ha antibodies. This patient initially presented with interstitial pneumonia. The initial anti-infective treatment was ineffective; however, symptoms improved following the addition of corticosteroids. Upon discontinuation of corticosteroids, the patient experienced a recurrence of cough, progressive worsening of dyspnea, and developed lower general weakness. Comprehensive autoantibody testing revealed positivity for anti-Ha antibodies, and MRI of the lower limbs indicated soft tissue edema. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with ASS with interstitial lung disease. Treatment with methylprednisolone pulse therapy, combined with cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus, tofacitinib citrate, and pirfenidone, led to an improvement in the patient's condition, resulting in discharge. Post-discharge, the patient was maintained on regular oral prednisone, nintedanib, and tofacitinib. Follow-up to date has shown a stable condition, with resolution of pulmonary lesions observed upon re-examination. Anti-Ha antibody is one of the specific antibodies associated with ASS, yet its positive rate remains exceedingly low. This case represents the first reported instance of an anti-Ha antibody-positive ASS in China. Misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis are prevalent in clinical practice, underscoring the importance of screening for autoantibodies when patients present with acute, unexplained interstitial lung changes and a poor response to anti-infective treatment. Furthermore, interstitial lung disease is the most common extra-muscular clinical manifestation observed in ASS patients. Differentiating between acute exacerbations of pulmonary infections and interstitial lung disease associated with rheumatic diseases poses a significant challenge, as both can occur concurrently. Therefore, during diagnosis and treatment, it is crucial to consider not only infections but also to identify the underlying causes of worsening lung lesions.",Frontiers in immunology,2025.0,Yinying Li; Junyi Ke; Shu Huang; Shiya Lin; Siyu Lei; Hongchun Huang; Luxi Lei; Qinglan Li; Yuanlan Wu; Minchao Duan,anti synthetase syndrome ass rare autoimmune myopathy frequently associate interstitial lung disease characterize presence anti aminoacyl trna synthetase ars antibodie limit report case exhibit positive anti ha antibodie study present retrospective analysis clinical datum patient acute exacerbation ass test positive anti ha antibodie patient initially present interstitial pneumonia initial anti infective treatment ineffective symptom improve follow addition corticosteroid discontinuation corticosteroid patient experience recurrence cough progressive worsening dyspnea develop low general weakness comprehensive autoantibody testing reveal positivity anti ha antibody mri low limb indicate soft tissue edema patient ultimately diagnose ass interstitial lung disease treatment methylprednisolone pulse therapy combine cyclophosphamide tacrolimus tofacitinib citrate pirfenidone lead improvement patient condition result discharge post discharge patient maintain regular oral prednisone nintedanib tofacitinib follow date show stable condition resolution pulmonary lesion observe examination anti ha antibody specific antibody associate ass positive rate remain exceedingly low case represent report instance anti ha antibody positive ass china misdiagnosis miss diagnosis prevalent clinical practice underscore importance screen autoantibody patient present acute unexplained interstitial lung change poor response anti infective treatment furthermore interstitial lung disease common extra muscular clinical manifestation observe ass patient differentiate acute exacerbation pulmonary infection interstitial lung disease associate rheumatic disease pose significant challenge occur concurrently diagnosis treatment crucial consider infection identify underlying cause worsen lung lesion

This study aimed to elucidate the clinical characteristics of, and the efficacy of treatments attempted in, patients with HA20 in Japan. Clinical information on HA20 patients from medical records was retrospectively collected through the attending physicians. Seventy-two HA20 patients were identified in Japan. And, 54 patients from 37 unrelated families were analyzed in detail. HA20 patients exhibited common features, including recurrent fever, gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal symptoms, and autoimmune disease; various organ disorders (e.g. neurological, liver, and pulmonary diseases) were less common complications. Molecular target drugs (MTDs) were administered in 44.4% of patients, among which anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α agents showed efficacy in 59.5% of patients. Eleven patients did not experience control of inflammation with initial MTDs, most commonly because of relapse due to secondary failure of MTDs. Anti-drug antibodies were related to the secondary failure of adalimumab in one patient and infusion reactions to infliximab in two patients. In such refractory cases, other treatments (e.g. switching the first MTD to an alternative agent or adding a Janus kinase inhibitor or immunomodulators, or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation [HCT]) were attempted. Our survey revealed that anti-TNF-α agents showed high efficacy. However, secondary failure of MTDs was a significant refractory-related factor in HA20 patients in Japan. Although anti-interferon therapies, thalidomide, and HCT might be potential treatment options, the results of this study suggest that further research is necessary to establish suitable treatments for HA20, especially for those with refractory disease.",Frontiers in immunology,2025.0,Mayuka Shiraki; Saori Kadowaki; Yuki Miwa; Kenichi Nishimura; Yuta Maruyama; Dai Kishida; Kazuo Imagawa; Chie Kobayashi; Hidetoshi Takada; Kanako Mitsunaga; Yuzaburo Inoue; Takasuke Ebato; Takayuki Miyamoto; Eitaro Hiejima; Shuzo Sato; Kiyoshi Migita; Tadashi Matsubayashi; Daisuke Kobayashi; Eriko Hasegawa; Utako Kaneko; Takashi Ishikawa; Masafumi Onodera; Kohei Matsushita; Yuhki Koike; Hiroaki Umebayashi; Fumihiko Kakuta; Daiki Abukawa; Yasutomo Funakoshi; Masataka Ishimura; Yusuke Otani; Takuya Nishizawa; Takashi Ishige; Reiko Hatori; Seiji Tanaka; Shouichirou Kusunoki; Kimitoshi Nakamura; Harumi Shirai; Yoshiho Hatai; Futaba Miyaoka; Shuya Kaneko; Asami Shimbo; Masaki Shimizu; Hirokazu Kanegane; Motomu Hashimoto; Nobuo Negoro; Taro Yoshida; Yasunori Wada; Masaaki Usami; Taizo Wada; Kazushi Izawa; Takahiro Yasumi; Ryuta Nishikomori; Hidenori Ohnishi,severity a20 haploinsufficiency ha20 vary establish clinical guideline treatment study aim elucidate clinical characteristic efficacy treatment attempt patient ha20 japan clinical information ha20 patient medical record retrospectively collect attend physician seventy ha20 patient identify japan 54 patient 37 unrelated family analyze detail ha20 patient exhibit common feature include recurrent fever gastrointestinal musculoskeletal symptom autoimmune disease organ disorder e.g. neurological liver pulmonary disease common complication molecular target drug mtds administer 44.4 patient anti tumor necrosis factor tnf)-α agent show efficacy 59.5 patient patient experience control inflammation initial mtd commonly relapse secondary failure mtds anti drug antibody relate secondary failure adalimumab patient infusion reaction infliximab patient refractory case treatment e.g. switch mtd alternative agent add janus kinase inhibitor immunomodulator allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation hct attempt survey reveal anti tnf α agent show high efficacy secondary failure mtds significant refractory relate factor ha20 patient japan anti interferon therapy thalidomide hct potential treatment option result study suggest research necessary establish suitable treatment ha20 especially refractory disease

40574783,Modulating oral microbiota ameliorates hypobaric hypoxia-induced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in mice.,"Hypobaric hypoxia exposure (HHE) often causes neuropsychiatric disorders. Due to its complex mechanism, efficient strategies for alleviating HHE-induced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors remain limited. To characterize alterations in the oral and gut microbiota following HHE and to explore a potential microbiota-based intervention to mitigate associated psychiatric symptoms. C57BL/6J mice were exposed to simulated high-altitude hypoxia (5000 m) for 1, 3, 5, or 7 days. Behavioral assessments, including the open field test, elevated plus maze, and forced swim test, were conducted to evaluate anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Oral and fecal microbiota were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing to assess changes in microbial composition and diversity. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to examine c-Fos expression in brain nuclei. A probiotic formulation containing <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> (<i>L. rhamnosus</i>) DSM17648, <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i> DDS-1, and <i>L. rhamnosus</i> UALR-06 was administered to mice subjected to one day of HHE (HH1) to evaluate its therapeutic efficacy. Behavioral tests revealed that HHE caused anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, which were most pronounced after 1 day of exposure. The IF data revealed significantly increased expression of c-Fos in various brain nuclei after HHE, including the anterior cingulate cortex, paraventricular thalamic nucleus, lateral habenula nucleus, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, and periaqueductal gray. The 16S rRNA sequencing results demonstrated a sharp decline in the abundance of <i>Lactobacillus</i> in the oral microbiota of mice exposed to HH1 and a marked decrease in the abundance of <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> in the fecal microbiota of mice exposed to three days of HHE. Finally, oral administration and gavage of <i>Lactobacillus</i> significantly alleviated anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in HH1 mice.

40574781,Sleep disorders and mental health: Understanding the cognitive connection.,"Sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, have emerged as a critical public health challenge, with the situation worsened by the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic. Insomnia symptoms, which affected up to 45% of the population during this period, highlight the urgent need to understand the mechanisms linking sleep disturbances to mental health outcomes. Recent findings suggest that cognitive failures, such as memory lapses and attentional deficits, mediate the relationship between insomnia and emotional disorders such as anxiety and depression. The role of personality traits, particularly neuroticism, adds further complexity, as it may either exacerbate or buffer these effects under specific conditions. This review explores the study by Li <i>et al</i>, which offers valuable insights into the cognitive-emotional pathways influenced by sleep disturbances. The study makes significant contributions by identifying key cognitive mechanisms and proposing the dual role of neuroticism in shaping emotional outcomes. To advance these findings, this letter advocates for future longitudinal research and the integration of targeted interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia, into public health frameworks.

To explore the effects of medical care-family integration-based exercise rehabilitation in older patients with CHF and psychological problems. Data from 118 older patients with CHF and psychological problems were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into conventional (<i>n</i> = 56) and exercise rehabilitation groups (<i>n</i> = 62). The results of the 6-min walking distance (6 MWD), N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), Minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire (MLHFQ), generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, 9-item patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Athens insomnia scale (AIS) were compared before and after intervention. After intervention, there were significant differences in the number of patients with depression and anxiety between the two groups. There was also a significant difference in the distribution of sleep disorders. The PHQ-9 score, GAD-7 score, AIS score, NT-proBNP value, LVEDD value, physical field, emotional field, other fields, and MLHFQ total scores were lower in the exercise rehabilitation group compared to the conventional rehabilitation group, while the 6 MWD and LVEF values were higher compared to the conventional rehabilitation group (<i>P</i> < 0.05). During the intervention period, the readmission rate of the exercise rehabilitation group (1.61%) was significantly lower than that of the conventional rehabilitation group (12.50%) (<i>χ</i> <sup>2</sup> = 3.930, <i>P</i> = 0.047).

40574770,Diagnostic dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging blood-brain barrier assessment combined with plasma biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment.,"The role of cerebral microvascular dysfunction in early cognitive impairment and dementia has become increasingly recognized. Furthermore, pathological changes in both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia are almost always associated with cerebral hemodynamic deficits. To investigate the diagnostic performance of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) assessment of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in combination with relevant plasma biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study selected 50 patients with non-amnestic MCI (na-MCI group), 52 patients with amnestic MCI (a-MCI group), and 55 healthy elderly controls (control group). The Chinese version of the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), auditory verbal learning test (AVLT), Hamilton anxiety/depression scale (HAMA/HAMD), and activity of daily living (ADL) scales were used to analyze the characteristics of mental and behavioral symptoms of patients with MCI. The DCE-MRI technique was used to assess the contrast enhancement kinetics. The Patlak model was utilized to analyze the BBB permeability (volume transfer constants). Further, fasting blood was was used to quantify plasma homocysteine (Hcy), β-amyloid protein (Aβ) 40, Aβ42, human phosphorylated tau-181 protein (p-tau181), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels, as well as serum neurofilament light chain (NFL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) concentrations. The na-MCI and a-MCI groups demonstrated significantly lower MoCA and AVLT-Huashan version scores, and statistically higher HAMA, HAMD, and ADL scores compared to the control group. Moreover, the a-MCI group showed notably higher HAMA, HAMD, and ADL scores compared to the na-MCI group. Cranial MRI results revealed significant disparities in cerebral blood flow in the left and right frontal lobes, temporal lobes, hippocampi, cuneus, precuneus, parietal lobes, basal ganglia, and occipital lobes between the a-MCI and na-MCI groups. Compared to healthy controls, patients with MCI demonstrated a smaller amplitude of hippocampal contrast enhancement kinetics and a slower decay rate, indicating smaller vascular volume and increased BBB permeability. Further, Hcy, p-tau181, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, PAI-1, and NFL levels were substantially higher in the a-MCI group than in the na-MCI group, whereas the Aβ42 level was significantly lower. We did not observe any significant differences in Aβ40 and GFAP levels. Patients with MCI may have experienced cerebrovascular system changes in the hippocampal region. Disorders associated with changes in cerebral blood supply may begin before pathophysiological changes are visible by imaging, which provides references for the assessment and treatment of patients with cognitive disorders. Further, DCE-MRI provides a noninvasive approach to diagnose subtle BBB leakage associated with cerebrovascular pathology.",World journal of psychiatry,2025.0,Ling Sun; Meng-Rong Xu; Cheng-Yu Zhou; Shao-Dong Cao; Xiao-Liang Zhang; Si-Qi Guan; Wen-Xu Sang; Xu-Ling Li,role cerebral microvascular dysfunction early cognitive impairment dementia increasingly recognize furthermore pathological change alzheimer disease vascular dementia associate cerebral hemodynamic deficit investigate diagnostic performance dynamic contrast enhance magnetic resonance imaging dce mri assessment blood brain barrier bbb combination relevant plasma biomarker mild cognitive impairment mci study select 50 patient non amnestic mci na mci group 52 patient amnestic mci mci group 55 healthy elderly control control group chinese version montreal cognitive assessment moca auditory verbal learning test avlt hamilton anxiety depression scale hama hamd activity daily living adl scale analyze characteristic mental behavioral symptom patient mci dce mri technique assess contrast enhancement kinetic patlak model utilize analyze bbb permeability volume transfer constant fast blood quantify plasma homocysteine hcy β amyloid protein aβ 40 aβ42 human phosphorylate tau-181 protein p tau181 intercellular adhesion molecule-1 icam-1 vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 vcam-1 plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 pai-1 level serum neurofilament light chain nfl glial fibrillary acidic protein gfap concentration na mci mci group demonstrate significantly low moca avlt huashan version score statistically high hama hamd adl score compare control group mci group show notably high hama hamd adl score compare na mci group cranial mri result reveal significant disparity cerebral blood flow left right frontal lobe temporal lobe hippocampi cuneus precuneus parietal lobe basal ganglia occipital lobe mci na mci group compare healthy control patient mci demonstrate small amplitude hippocampal contrast enhancement kinetic slow decay rate indicate small vascular volume increase bbb permeability hcy p tau181 icam-1 vcam-1 pai-1 nfl level substantially high mci group na mci group aβ42 level significantly low observe significant difference aβ40 gfap level patient mci experience cerebrovascular system change hippocampal region disorder associate change cerebral blood supply begin pathophysiological change visible imaging provide reference assessment treatment patient cognitive disorder dce mri provide noninvasive approach diagnose subtle bbb leakage associate cerebrovascular pathology
40574764,Neural correlates of rumination in remitted depressive episodes: Brain network connectivity and topology analyses.,"Rumination is a critical psychological factor contributing to the relapse of major depressive episodes (MDEs) and a core residual symptom in remitted MDEs. Investigating its neural correlations is essential for developing strategies to prevent MDE relapse. Despite its clinical importance, the brain network mechanisms underlying rumination in remitted MDE patients have yet to be fully elucidated. To investigate the brain network mechanism underlying rumination in patients with remitted MDEs using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We conducted an fMRI-based rumination-distraction task to induce rumination and distraction states in 51 patients with remitted MDEs. Functional connectivity (FC) was analyzed using the network-based statistic (NBS) approach, and eight topological metrics were calculated to compare the network topological properties between the two states. Correlation analyses were further performed to identify the relationships between individual rumination levels and the significantly altered brain network metrics. The NBS analysis revealed that the altered FCs between the rumination and distraction states were located primarily in the frontoparietal, default mode, and cerebellar networks. No significant correlation was detected between these altered FCs and individual rumination levels. Among the eight topological metrics, the clustering coefficient, shortest path length, and local efficiency were significantly lower during rumination and positively correlated with individual rumination levels. In contrast, global efficiency was greater in the rumination state than in the distraction state and was negatively correlated with individual rumination levels. Our work revealed the altered FC and topological properties during rumination in remitted MDE patients, offering valuable insights into the neural mechanisms of rumination from a brain network perspective.",World journal of psychiatry,2025.0,Kang-Ning Li; Shi-Xiong Tang; You-Fu Tao; Hai-Ruo He; Mo-Han Ma; Qian-Qian Zhang; Mei Huang; Wen-Tao Chen; Hui Liang; Ao-Qian Deng; Si-Rui Gao; Fan-Yu Meng; Yi-Lin Peng; Yu-Meng Ju; Wen-Wen Ou; Su Shu; Yan Zhang,rumination critical psychological factor contribute relapse major depressive episode mde core residual symptom remit mde investigate neural correlation essential develop strategy prevent mde relapse despite clinical importance brain network mechanism underlie rumination remitted mde patient fully elucidate investigate brain network mechanism underlie rumination patient remit mde functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri conduct fmri base rumination distraction task induce rumination distraction state 51 patient remit mde functional connectivity fc analyze network base statistic nbs approach topological metric calculate compare network topological property state correlation analysis perform identify relationship individual rumination level significantly alter brain network metric nbs analysis reveal alter fc rumination distraction state locate primarily frontoparietal default mode cerebellar network significant correlation detect alter fc individual rumination level topological metric cluster coefficient short path length local efficiency significantly low rumination positively correlate individual rumination level contrast global efficiency great rumination state distraction state negatively correlate individual rumination level work reveal altered fc topological property rumination remitted mde patient offer valuable insight neural mechanism rumination brain network perspective

40574762,Cerebral hemodynamic characteristics of patients with auditory verbal hallucinations and the construction of nomogram models.,"The characteristics of cerebral hemodynamic indexes of patients with different types of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) was not clear. To explore the characteristics of cerebral hemodynamic indexes of patients with different types of AVHs and construct the risk nomogram prediction model of patients with different types of AVHs. Patients with different types of verbal hallucinations who visited Wenzhou Seventh People's Hospital were retrospectively selected from March 2021 to March 2023, and these patients were classified into 117 cases of schizophrenia (SCZ) with AVHs, 108 cases of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with AVHs, and 105 cases of recurrent depressive disorder with AVHs according to type. Transcranial doppler was performed to measure the hemodynamic parameters of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), middle cerebral artery (MCA), posterior cerebral artery (PCA), basilar artery (BA) and vertebral artery (VA). Logistic regression modelling was used to explore the factors affecting patients with different types of AVHs and odds ratio, 95% confidence interval (CI). A clinical prediction model was constructed, and the efficacy of the clinical prediction model was evaluated by using receiver operating characteristic, Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness-of-Fit test, calibration curves and decision curve analysis. The differences between the three groups of patients in mean velocity (Vm)-MCA, end-diastolic velocity (Vd)-MCA, Vm-ACA, pulsatility index (PI)-ACA, Vm-PCA, peak systolic velocity (Vs)-PCA, Vd-PCA, Vm-BA, Vs-BA, Vd-BA, PI-BA, resistance index (RI)-BA, Vm-VA, Vs-VA, Vd-VA, PI-VA, and RI-VA indexes were statistically significant. Rising Vm-ACA is an independent risk factor for SCZ with AVHs, and falling Vm-VA, Vd-MCA, and Vd-VA are independent risk factors for SCZ with AVHs. Rising Vm-ACA, Vm-PCA, Vs-PCA, Vd-PCA, Vm-BA, and Vs-BA are independent risk factors for PTSD with AVHs, and Vm-MCA, Vs-MCA, Vd-MCA, PI-PCA, and RI-BA are independent protective factors for PTSD with AVHs. Elevated Vm-MCA, Vd-MCA, RI-BA, Vm-VA, and Vd-VA were independent risk factors, and elevated Vm-ACA, Vs-ACA, Vm-PCA, Vs-PCA, and Vd-PCA were independent protective factors. The areas under the curve of the three models were 0.82 (95%CI: 0.76-0.87), 0.88 (95%CI: 0.83-0.92), and 0.81 (95%CI: 0.77-0.86), respectively; the Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness-of-Fit test of the calibration curves of the three models suggests that <i>P</i> > 0.05.

40574761,"Interplay between insomnia, anxiety, and depression.","Insomnia, anxiety, and depression have become critical mental health issues exacerbated by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, highlighting the importance of understanding their interrelationships. This article evaluates the study by Li <i>et al</i>, which investigates the links between insomnia, anxiety, and depression while examining the mediating role of cognitive failures and the moderating effect of neuroticism. The study employed a cross-sectional design with 1011 participants, using validated scales to measure insomnia severity, neuroticism, cognitive failures, and mental health indicators. Li <i>et al</i> found that approximately 40% of participants exhibited symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia, with most cases being mild. The results demonstrated that cognitive failures play a mediating role in the relationship between insomnia and both anxiety and depression. Furthermore, neuroticism moderated the relationship between insomnia and cognitive failures, with a stronger effect observed in individuals with lower levels of neuroticism. These findings underscore the importance of considering personality traits and cognitive processes in understanding mental health outcomes. This study emphasizes the critical need for interventions aimed at reducing cognitive failures and enhancing emotional stability to mitigate the impact of insomnia on mental health. Strategies to improve sleep quality, boost cognitive resilience, and regulate emotional responses could significantly enhance individuals' mental well-being. Moreover, integrating personality assessments into mental health services could facilitate more effective and personalized interventions. This article provides an original perspective on the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on global mental health. The content of the article addresses the complex relationships between sleep disorders, cognitive function losses, and neuroticism in light of data compiled from existing literature and current research. In addition, how these relationships have deepened during the pandemic and the effectiveness of proposed treatment methods for these phenomena are discussed in comparison with previous studies. The arguments in the article offer new perspectives and suggestions aimed at filling gaps in the literature, and make an important contribution to both clinical practice and public health policies.

40574647,Pica in Childhood: Concurrent and Sequential Psychiatric Comorbidity.,"Pica is the persistent eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances, and is associated with serious medical consequences. There has been a lack of research into the psychiatric comorbidities of pica, despite being important for informing clinical care. The current study examines psychiatric comorbidities of pica in childhood and the longitudinal relationship between childhood pica and adolescent eating disorders. We analyzed data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children study. Pica and psychopathology, assessed with the Development and Well-Being Assessment and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, were assessed at about 7- and 10-years of age, and reported eating disorders (EDs) at 14-, 16-, and 18-years of age. We conducted linear and logistic regression models, adjusting for covariates, to identify concurrent psychiatric comorbidities, as well as risk for later EDs. We conducted the Benjamini-Hochberg correction procedure to correct for multiple testing. Pica (prevalence ranged from 0.33% to 2.33% dependent on age) was associated with increased odds of any psychiatric disorder and behavioral disorders in early childhood (OR = 7.30, q < 0.001, and OR = 5.65, q < 0.001, respectively) and mid-childhood (OR = 5.75, q < 0.001, and OR = 10.66, q < 0.001, respectively), and greater concurrent hyperactivity, conduct problems, peer problems, prosocial difficulties, and emotional difficulties (q < 0.01 across analyses).

40574638,Neuromodulation of the right inferior frontal gyrus in bipolar disorder to target response inhibition: a proof-of-concept study.,"Bipolar disorder (BD) affects over 1% of the population and is characterized by deficits in response inhibition. Response inhibition, a crucial component of executive functions, involves the ability to suppress or withhold a planned or ongoing response that is no longer required or appropriate in a given context. Response inhibition may be dissociated into three subcomponents: interference inhibition, action withholding, and action cancellation. These subcomponents are assessed using the hybrid response inhibition (HRI) task. Previous research has shown that inhibitory control is strongly lateralized to the right hemisphere. Specifically, the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) is a key node underpinning response inhibition and might be amenable to neuromodulation using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). This proof-of-concept study aimed to investigate the effects of rTMS targeting the rIFG on response inhibition in individuals with BD and controls. We investigated HRI performance scores in individuals with BD (<i>n</i> = 12) and sex-/age-matched controls (<i>n</i> = 12) immediately before and after intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) and continuous TBS to modulate cortical excitability of the rIFG.

40574580,A randomised controlled feasibility trial comparing culturally adapted psychoeducation and treatment as usual for persons with bipolar disorders in Nigeria.,"Bipolar disorders are a major cause of disability worldwide, with most of the disease burden attributed to those in low- and middle-income countries, including Nigeria. There is limited evidence on culturally appropriate interventions for bipolar disorders in Nigeria. The study aims to examine the feasibility, and acceptability of culturally adapted psychoeducation (CaPE) for treating bipolar disorders. A randomised controlled trial (RCT) compared CaPE plus treatment as usual (TAU) with TAU alone among 34 persons with bipolar disorders in Jos, Nigeria. CaPE comprised 12 group sessions of in-person psychoeducation lasting approximately 90 min each, delivered on a weekly basis by clinical researchers supervised by clinical psychologists and consultant psychiatrists. The primary outcome was feasibility, measured by participants' recruitment and retention rates. Other outcomes included acceptability as measured by the Service Satisfaction Scale (SSS), Brief Bipolar Disorder Symptom Scale (BBDSS), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Quality-of-Life scale (EQ5D). Outcomes were assessed at baseline and weeks 12 and 24. Focus group (<i>n</i> = 10) and individual interviews (<i>n</i> = 5) were conducted with the CaPE + TAU group, recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. The CaPE+TAU group (<i>n</i> = 17) recorded a high participant recruitment and retention rate of 86% across 12 sessions, and also recorded a higher level of satisfaction with SSS compared with the TAU alone group; 87.5% indicated very satisfied compared with 66.7% indicated not sure in the TAU group. In terms of clinical outcomes, for PHQ-9 scores the intervention group showed a reduction from baseline to end of intervention (EOI) and follow-up, with differences of -12.01 and -7.39, respectively (both <i>P</i> < 0.001). The EQ5D index showed a notable improvement in the intervention group at both EOI and follow-up (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Lastly, BBDS scores decreased significantly in the CaPE+TAU group at both EOI and follow-up, with differences of -21.45 and -15.76 (both <i>P</i> < 0.001).

40574565,How negative life events affect emotional eating in Chinese adolescents: moderated mediation model.,"Emotional eating, the tendency to eat in response to negative emotions, is rising among adolescents and linked to obesity and mental health issues. While negative life events contribute to emotional eating, the roles of self-control and social support remain unclear. This study examined the relationship between negative life events and emotional eating in adolescents, testing self-control as a mediator and perceived social support as a moderator. A sample of 740 Chinese high school students (aged 14-18) completed validated measures of negative life events, self-control, perceived social support, and emotional eating. Data were analyzed using SPSS 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA)and PROCESS macro for mediation/moderation effects. Negative life events predicted higher emotional eating (<i>β</i> = 0.11, <i>p</i> < 0.01), while lower self-control mediated this relationship (<i>β</i> = -0.15, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Perceived social support moderated the association (<i>β</i> = -0.09, <i>p</i> < 0.05), weakening it among adolescents with stronger support.

40574549,The Impact of Adding Multisensory Stimulation to a Fear of Heights Virtual Reality Experience.,"The sense of presence (SP) is a critical factor in eliciting emotional responses during virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) for treating anxiety disorders. Multisensory stimulation has been suggested as an effective method to enhance the SP in VR environments. This study aims to investigate the relationship between SP and anxiety in a VR environment designed to simulate fear of heights (FoH). Specifically, it compares the levels of SP and anxiety experienced in multisensory (i.e., visual, auditory and tactile stimulation) versus bisensory (i.e., visual and auditory stimulation) virtual environments and examines the associations between SP and individual characteristics. A total of 162 participants were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions: bisensory virtual reality exposure (B-VRE; n = 85) and multisensory virtual reality exposure (M-VRE; n = 77). Differences in anxiety and SP between the two conditions were assessed using Student's t-tests. In addition, correlation, mediation and moderation analyses were conducted to explore the relationships between SP, anxiety, technological features and individual characteristics. Correlation analyses revealed statistically significant relationships between SP and anxiety during VR exposure, as well as between SP and participants' demographic and personality characteristics. Furthermore, SP partially mediated the relationship between participants' baseline FoH and the anxiety they experienced in the VR environment. Finally, the addition of multisensory cues increased the SP experienced in the virtual scenario but did not significantly impact reported anxiety levels. Incorporating multisensory feedback to enhance SP during VRET should be considered when designing VR systems for therapeutic use. Adding multisensory cues enhances users' sense of presence in virtual environments. Sense of presence partially mediates the link between fear of heights and anxiety during VR exposure.

In the Netherlands, a 6-month residential version (R-ISTDP) of this traditionally outpatient therapy for patients with treatment-resistant personality disorders was developed and tested. This study focused on changes that occurred directly after treatment and 1-10 years after discharge. All patients admitted to the R-ISTDP program between 1995 and 2005 were assessed at admission, discharge, and a variable follow-up of 1-10 years. In this single-arm trial, treatment outcome was measured in terms of symptom severity (with the Symptom Checklist-90-R [SCL-90-R]), general functioning (with the Global Assessment of Functioning [GAF] Scale), employment status, social welfare benefits, and living situation. Demographic variables and psychopathology indicators were included as predictors. Because of the variable distribution of length of follow-up, outcome data from 155 patients were evaluated by using mixed-models analysis. From admission to discharge, significant and large improvements were seen in SCL-90-R total scores (d=1.2) and GAF scores (d=0.9). From discharge over the course of 10-year follow-up, SCL-90-R total scores remained stable, and GAF scores further improved (d=1.5). At follow-up 1-10 years after discharge, more patients had returned to work compared with pretreatment. No statistically significant association between any of the predictors and outcome was found.

40574522,Review Article: The acceptability and effectiveness of standardised diagnostic assessment approaches in children and young people's mental health services - an updated systematic review.,"Standardised diagnostic assessment (SDA) tools are designed to comprehensively evaluate various mental health disorders and support accurate diagnoses. While evidence for their routine use in child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) remains limited, increasing service demands underscore the need for efficient clinical assessments. This updated review examines the acceptability and clinical utility of SDA tools in CAMHS. A systematic review of 464 studies published between January 2013 and February 2025 was conducted (PROSPERO: CRD42024494051). Ten studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising eight cross-sectional studies and two randomised controlled trials. SDA tools reviewed included Development and Wellbeing Assessment (DAWBA), Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID) and Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (KSADS). DAWBA improved referral decision accuracy, while both DAWBA and MINI-KID had acceptable agreements with expert consensus diagnoses. MINI-KID and KSADS were able to identify more cases than routine clinical assessments. However, DAWBA did not show effectiveness in changing diagnostic practice. Clinicians were favourable of SDA tools' psychometric properties but less favourable of diagnostic labels and feasibility in practice. Psychiatrists and psychologists were more likely than other healthcare professionals to use these tools in practice. This review highlights that while SDA tools may aid referral decisions, evidence supporting their overall effectiveness in CAMHS is lacking.

40574509,Investigating the association between the number of interpersonal supporters during first-time pregnancy and postpartum depression symptoms.,"First-year postpartum depression is a common mental health problem among first-time mothers. A younger age of pregnancy often compounds the challenge due to underlying factors such as poverty and limited educational achievement. This study aimed to examine the minimal number of interpersonal supporters during pregnancy associated with lower levels of postpartum depressive symptoms among first-time mothers. We obtained data from the population-based Mother-Infant/Newborn Tokyo Cohort (MINT cohort) in four municipalities in Tokyo on 429 first-time mothers who responded to two waves of surveys (early pregnancy and one month postpartum). They completed self-report measures of interpersonal support using one item from the Social Support Questionnaire and depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Segmented regression analyses were conducted to determine the threshold at which the strength of the association changed between the number of interpersonal supporters and postpartum depressive symptoms, with adjustment for depressive symptoms in pregnancy. This analysis was also conducted with the sample stratified into young mothers (≤ 25 years) and older mothers (≥ 26 years). In the overall sample, postpartum depressive symptoms were found to be lower among individuals with more than 3.0 supportive individuals (prepartum). Among young mothers, this threshold was higher, with lower symptom levels observed among those with at least 5.3 supporters. Only 22.9% of young first-time mothers had this level of interpersonal support, compared to 54.8% of all first-time mothers. Our results suggest that having four or more interpersonal supporters in early pregnancy is associated with lower levels of postpartum depressive symptoms among first-time mothers. Additionally, among young mothers, having six or more supporters was associated with lower postpartum depressive symptoms.

40574459,Identification of Schwann Cells in Human Intracranial Arteries: Potential Regulatory Role in Atherosclerotic Plaque Progression.,"Intracranial atherosclerosis (ICAS), a common cause of ischemic stroke, remains a therapeutic challenge due to complex intracranial anatomy and intervention risks. Although ICAS develops intracranially, cerebral artery innervation originates in the peripheral nervous system. The scarcity of human intracranial specimens has hindered investigations into the potential role of Schwann cells (SCs) in neurovascular homeostasis. Using multimodal analysis of plaque-bearing and non-plaque-bearing intracranial artery samples from the same postmortem individuals (n = 16 donors), SCs associated with myelinated neural structures are identified. Quantitative ultrastructural evaluation reveals a 4.3-fold increase in SC-derived myelin sheaths within plaque-bearing vessels (P <0.001). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of SCs demonstrates significant upregulation of genes involved in axonogenesis, axon ensheathment, axon guidance, synaptic transmission, and synaptic integration. Cell-cell communication analysis shows enhanced interactions between SCs and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in plaque-bearing vessels. Synaptic-like structures are observed in the walls of intracranial arteries, along with a 2.9-fold increase in VSMC-innervating myelinated fibers (P <0.001). Ligand-receptor analysis indicates SPP1-ITGB1 signaling as a potential mediator of SCs-VSMCs crosstalk.

Central sensitisation (CS) is a significant factor in both chronic pain and temporomandibular disorders. Psychological aspects like anxiety and depression are known to exacerbate pain symptoms. However, the interplay between CS and these factors in CMMP remains unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between CS, anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with CMMP and to assess how they correlate. A total of 206 patients with CMMP underwent a clinical examination following the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD) and completed the Central Sensitisation Inventory (CSI), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaires.

40574425,Long Term High-Salt Diet Induces Cognitive Impairments via Down-Regulating SHANK1.,"High-salt (HS) diet is an established risk factor for cognitive impairment, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study reveals that HS diet reduces SHANK1, a key postsynaptic scaffolding protein, via downregulation of the PKA/CREB pathway, leading to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits in rats. RNA sequencing of HS-fed rat hippocampi showed downregulation of cAMP signaling and SHANK1 expression. Pharmacological inhibition of PKA/CREB reduced SHANK1 levels and impaired dendritic structure and synaptic function, while PKA activation restored CREB activity and SHANK1 expression, reversing HS-induced deficits. Notably, CREB activation is essential for SHANK1 regulation, as a CREB mutant (S133A) blocked the effects of PKA activation, and a constitutively active CREB (S133D) prevented SHANK1 downregulation. These findings highlight the PKA/CREB/SHANK1 pathway as a potential therapeutic target for HS-induced cognitive dysfunction.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2025.0,Cuiping Guo; Yuanyuan Li; Wensheng Li; Tongrui Wu; Yi Liu; Yacoubou Abdoul Razak Mahaman; Jianzhi Wang; Rong Liu; Wei Liu; Hui Shen; Xiaochuan Wang,high salt hs diet establish risk factor cognitive impairment underlie mechanism remain unclear study reveal hs diet reduce shank1 key postsynaptic scaffold protein downregulation pka creb pathway lead synaptic dysfunction cognitive deficit rat rna sequence hs fed rat hippocampi show downregulation camp signal shank1 expression pharmacological inhibition pka creb reduce shank1 level impaired dendritic structure synaptic function pka activation restore creb activity shank1 expression reverse hs induce deficit notably creb activation essential shank1 regulation creb mutant s133a block effect pka activation constitutively active creb s133d prevent shank1 downregulation finding highlight pka creb shank1 pathway potential therapeutic target hs induce cognitive dysfunction
40574410,Astrocytic abnormalities in brain-specific <i>Cacna1c</i>-deficient mice: Implications for BBB impairment in neuropsychiatric diseases associated with <i>CACNA1C</i> mutations.,"Intronic genetic variants within the <i>CACNA1C</i> gene, which encodes the pore-forming alpha 1c subunit of the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 L-type calcium channel, are significant risk factors for a multitude of neuropsychiatric disorders. In most cases, these intronic SNPs have been associated with reduced <i>CACNA1C</i> expression. Here, we demonstrate that targeted genetic deletion of <i>Cacna1c</i> in mouse brain leads to increased astrocyte reactivity, increased expression of aquaporin 4 (AQP4) in astrocytes adjacent to the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and neuroinflammation, including changes in the levels of brain chemokines and inflammatory cytokines. Astrocytes are vital for maintaining BBB integrity, with AQP4 predominantly expressed in astrocytic endfeet where it regulates water balance in the brain. This function is critical to brain health, and deterioration of the BBB is a major feature of virtually all forms of neuropsychiatric disease.

40574301,Association of Genetic Variations in Energy Metabolism Genes with Noise-Induced Hearing Loss in a Chinese Population: A Case-Control Study.,"This study explored the relationship between susceptibility to single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in a population exposed to occupational noise. Workers exposed to noise in a steel enterprise in Henan Province were included in the study. Workers with a hearing threshold of ≥40 dB (A) for binaural high-frequency (3000, 4000, and 6000 Hz) in the pure tone audiometry were included in the case group (393 workers in total). Individuals whose hearing threshold for any frequency (500, 1000, and 2000 Hz) was ≤25 dB (A) and an average hearing threshold of <35 dB (A) for high frequencies were included in the control group (731 individuals in total). A SNPscan multiple SNP typing kit was used for SNP typing, and PLINK software was used in analyzing the correlation between each gene locus and NIHL susceptibility. Cumulative noise exposure (CNE) was stratified as CNE < 97 dB (A) · year and CNE ≥ 97 dB (A) · year. Regarding rs11204100, compared with subjects with the TT genotype, subjects with the TC+CC genotype were less susceptible to NIHL (odds ratio [OR] [95% CI] = 0.712 [0.554, 0.913], P = 0.009). After CNE stratification, subjects with the TC+CC genotype were less susceptible to NIHL than those with the TT genotype in the CNE ≥97 dB (A) · year group (OR [95% CI] = 0.614 [0.433, 0.871], P = 0.007). As for the rs10503675, subjects with the AG+GG genotype were less susceptible to NIHL than subjects with the AA genotype (OR [95% CI] = 0.797 [0.541, 0.925], P = 0.011) in the general population. Haplotype results showed that CGT (rs11204100-rs10503675-rs17412009) is associated with lowered susceptibility to NIHL.

40574299,Conicity Index Associated with Adult Hearing Impairment: A Cross-Sectional Study Based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2001-2018).,"This study aimed to evaluate the association of conicity index (C-index), a marker of abdominal obesity, with hearing impairment (HI) in US adults using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We conducted a cross-sectional investigation using data from nine NHANES cycles spanning from 2001 to 2018. The C-index was used as the independent variable, whereas HI-defined as a pure-tone average hearing threshold exceeding 25 dB HL-was the outcome measure. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the association between C-index and HI, adjusting for potential confounders including age, sex, race/ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes, total cholesterol, haemoglobin and blood urea nitrogen. Dose-response relationships were evaluated using trend tests (P for trend) and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess potential interaction effects. A total of 7394 adults aged 20-69 were included. Higher C-index values were significantly associated with an increased prevalence of HI. In the fully adjusted model, each unit increase in C-index was associated with 7.35-fold higher odds of HI (95% CI: 3.03-17.82, P < 0.01). When stratified into tertiles, individuals in the highest tertile had a 57% higher likelihood of HI compared to the lowest tertile (Odds Ratio = 1.57, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.14-2.18, P < 0.01). RCS analysis indicated a significant non-linear association (P for non-linearity < 0.05) with an inflection point at a C-index of 1.17. Subgroup analysis revealed significant interaction effects of C-index with gender, diabetes and hypertension (P for interaction < 0.05) but not with age (P > 0.05). Higher C-index values are independently associated with greater odds of HI. Given the rising burden of obesity and its metabolic consequences, the C-index may serve as a practical tool for HI risk assessment, especially in populations with cardiometabolic risk factors.",Noise & health,,Guifen Cai; Xiaoyan Xu; Xiaokun Li; Qiong Fang,study aim evaluate association conicity index c index marker abdominal obesity hearing impairment hi adult datum national health nutrition examination survey nhanes conduct cross sectional investigation datum nhanes cycle span 2001 2018 c index independent variable hi define pure tone average hearing threshold exceed 25 db hl outcome measure multivariable logistic regression model assess association c index hi adjust potential confounder include age sex race ethnicity hypertension diabetes total cholesterol haemoglobin blood urea nitrogen dose response relationship evaluate trend test p trend restrict cubic spline rcs analysis subgroup analysis perform assess potential interaction effect total 7394 adult age 20 69 include high c index value significantly associate increase prevalence hi fully adjust model unit increase c index associate 7.35 fold high odd hi 95 ci 3.03 17.82 p < 0.01 stratify tertile individual high tertile 57 high likelihood hi compare low tertile odd ratio = 1.57 95 confidence interval 1.14 2.18 p < 0.01 rcs analysis indicate significant non linear association p non linearity < 0.05 inflection point c index 1.17 subgroup analysis reveal significant interaction effect c index gender diabete hypertension p interaction < 0.05 age p > 0.05 high c index value independently associate great odd hi give rise burden obesity metabolic consequence c index serve practical tool hi risk assessment especially population cardiometabolic risk factor
40574296,Mental health effects of exposure to environmental noise at home: A systematic review of potential mediating pathways.,"Research has established a mental health impact of exposure to environmental noise, but specific mechanisms driving this association are poorly understood. Several plausible mediating factors have been proposed, including noise annoyance and sleep disturbance. We undertook a systematic review of the literature to synthesize the existing evidence on possible mediating pathways between exposure to environmental noise and poor mental health in adults. We systematically searched Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, and Web of Science databases to identify relevant studies published up to May 2023. Studies of the mental health impact in adults of environmental noise at home that examined at least one mediator were included. Included studies were assessed for risk of bias. Findings from included studies were synthesized narratively. Study heterogeneity and high risk of bias precluded meta-analysis. Of the 892 studies retrieved, 14 met the inclusion criteria. These spanned 13 unique mediators. Some studies examined multiple mediators. The most commonly examined mediators were noise annoyance (nine studies), sleep disturbance (four studies), and physical activity (two studies). Taken together, these studies provide support for noise annoyance and sleep playing a role in the mediation of the noise-mental health association, while evidence was limited or absent for other mediators. The small number of studies and high risk of bias leads to low certainty of evidence. Noise annoyance and sleep disturbance are likely mediators of the relationship between exposure to environmental noise at home and poor mental health. However, higher quality and longitudinal researches are needed to clarify these and other potential mediating pathways.",Noise & health,,Kaya Grocott; Adelle Mansour; Eleanor Shiels; Rebecca Bentley; Kate Mason,research establish mental health impact exposure environmental noise specific mechanism drive association poorly understand plausible mediating factor propose include noise annoyance sleep disturbance undertake systematic review literature synthesize exist evidence possible mediating pathway exposure environmental noise poor mental health adult systematically search medline psycinfo embase web science database identify relevant study publish 2023 study mental health impact adult environmental noise home examine mediator include include study assess risk bias finding include study synthesize narratively study heterogeneity high risk bias preclude meta analysis 892 study retrieve 14 meet inclusion criterion span 13 unique mediator study examine multiple mediator commonly examine mediator noise annoyance study sleep disturbance study physical activity study take study provide support noise annoyance sleep play role mediation noise mental health association evidence limited absent mediator small number study high risk bias lead low certainty evidence noise annoyance sleep disturbance likely mediator relationship exposure environmental noise home poor mental health high quality longitudinal research need clarify potential mediating pathway
40574294,Patients with Tinnitus: Their Perspective on Sound Generators.,"Sound therapy (ST) is a well-known treatment option for tinnitus patients. However, patient perspectives on this option remain scarce. This study investigated the perspectives of first-time sound generator users on ST for chronic tinnitus, focusing on their perceptions of the sound generators and the effects on tinnitus. The subjects were 29 adult patients with chronic tinnitus who received ST using sound generators for the first time. In the 3-week ST trial, In the 3-week ST trial, hearing aids with built-in sound generators built idelivered broadband noise at a low and individualized sound level. Semistructured interviews were conducted 1 month after the ST trial. Using an interpretive description approach, themes were captured qualitatively to describe patients' subjective experience of the ST. After performing inductive coding on the dataset, five main themes emerged: (1) effects while wearing the generators; (2) effects after removing the generators; (3) perception of the generated noise; (4) untargeted effects; and (5) purchasing sound generators. Each theme was further subdivided into one to three subthemes. The study highlighted uncertainties regarding the overall perceived benefits of short-term ST, with results influenced by initial noise hypersensitivity, hearing loss, and noise appreciation. Future research should examine the benefits of ST after controlling for these variables and compare the effects of different types of tailored sound on each dimension of tinnitus. Understanding how noise physiologically modulates tinnitus both during and after exposure is crucial to better counsel patients on what to expect.",Noise & health,,Bérangère Villatte; Charlotte Bigras; Philippe Fournier; Elizabeth Fitzpatrick; Sylvie Hébert,sound therapy st know treatment option tinnitus patient patient perspective option remain scarce study investigate perspective time sound generator user st chronic tinnitus focus perception sound generator effect tinnitus subject 29 adult patient chronic tinnitus receive st sound generator time 3 week st trial 3 week st trial hear aid build sound generator build idelivere broadband noise low individualized sound level semistructured interview conduct 1 month st trial interpretive description approach theme capture qualitatively describe patient subjective experience st perform inductive coding dataset main theme emerge 1 effect wear generator 2 effect remove generator 3 perception generate noise 4 untargeted effect 5 purchase sound generator theme subdivide subtheme study highlight uncertainty overall perceive benefit short term st result influence initial noise hypersensitivity hear loss noise appreciation future research examine benefit st control variable compare effect different type tailor sound dimension tinnitus understand noise physiologically modulate tinnitus exposure crucial well counsel patient expect

40574020,Liposomal and Lipid-Based Drug Delivery Systems: Bridging Gut Microbiota and Pediatric Disorder Treatments.,"The intestine is an important segment of the gastrointestinal tract, which is involved in complex processes that maintain the body's normal homeostasis. It hosts a vast, diverse, and dynamic microbial community called the gut microbiota, which develops from birth. It has been observed that the gut microbiota is involved in essential physiological processes, including the development of the central nervous system via the gut microbiota-brain axis. An alteration of the gut microbiota can lead to serious health problems, including defective neurodevelopment. Thus, this paper aims to highlight the most recent advances in studies that focus on the link between the gut microbiota and the evolution of neurodevelopmental diseases in children. Currently, studies show that the use of drugs that stimulate and restore the gut microbiota (e.g., probiotics and prebiotics) have the potential to alleviate some of the symptoms associated with conditions such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Tic Disorder, Tourette Syndrome, epilepsy, and Down Syndrome. In addition, due to the challenges associated with drug administration in children, as well as the widespread shortage of medications intended for pediatric use, researchers are working on the development of new delivery systems. Liposome-based systems or solid lipid nanoparticles have been safely used for drug delivery in various pediatric conditions, which may also indicate their potential for use in the administration of microbiota-modulating therapies.",Pharmaceutics,2025.0,Raluca Ioana Teleanu; Elena-Theodora Moldoveanu; Adelina-Gabriela Niculescu; Elena Predescu; Eugenia Roza; Iulia Florentina Tincu; Alexandru Mihai Grumezescu; Daniel Mihai Teleanu,intestine important segment gastrointestinal tract involve complex process maintain body normal homeostasis host vast diverse dynamic microbial community call gut microbiota develop birth observe gut microbiota involve essential physiological process include development central nervous system gut microbiota brain axis alteration gut microbiota lead health problem include defective neurodevelopment paper aim highlight recent advance study focus link gut microbiota evolution neurodevelopmental disease child currently study use drug stimulate restore gut microbiota e.g. probiotic prebiotic potential alleviate symptom associate condition autism spectrum disorder attention deficit hyperactivity disorder tic disorder tourette syndrome epilepsy syndrome addition challenge associate drug administration child widespread shortage medication intend pediatric use researcher work development new delivery system liposome base system solid lipid nanoparticle safely drug delivery pediatric condition indicate potential use administration microbiota modulate therapy
40574019,Crossing the Blood-Brain Barrier: Innovations in Receptor- and Transporter-Mediated Transcytosis Strategies.,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective and natural protective membrane that restricts the entry of therapeutic agents into the central nervous system (CNS). This restrictive nature poses a major challenge for pharmacological treatment of a wide range of CNS disorders, including neurodegenerative disorders, brain tumors, and psychiatric conditions. Many chemical drugs and biopharmaceuticals are unable to cross the BBB, and conventional drug delivery methods often fail to achieve sufficient brain concentrations, leading to reduced therapeutic efficacy and increased risk of systemic toxicity. In recent years, targeted drug delivery strategies have emerged as promising approaches to overcome the BBB and enhance the delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain. Among these, receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) and transporter-mediated transcytosis (TMT) are two of the most extensively studied mechanisms for transporting drugs across brain endothelial cells into the brain parenchyma. Advances in materials science and nanotechnology have facilitated the development of multifunctional carriers with optimized properties, improving drug targeting, stability, and release profiles within the brain. This review summarizes the physiological structure of the BBB and highlights recent innovations in RMT- and TMT-mediated brain drug delivery systems, emphasizing their potential not only to overcome current challenges in CNS drug development, but also to pave the way for next-generation therapies that enable more precise, effective, and personalized treatment of brain-related diseases.",Pharmaceutics,2025.0,Ling Ding; Pratiksha Kshirsagar; Prachi Agrawal; Daryl J Murry,blood brain barrier bbb highly selective natural protective membrane restrict entry therapeutic agent central nervous system cns restrictive nature pose major challenge pharmacological treatment wide range cns disorder include neurodegenerative disorder brain tumor psychiatric condition chemical drug biopharmaceutical unable cross bbb conventional drug delivery method fail achieve sufficient brain concentration lead reduce therapeutic efficacy increase risk systemic toxicity recent year target drug delivery strategy emerge promising approach overcome bbb enhance delivery therapeutic agent brain receptor mediate transcytosis rmt transporter mediate transcytosis tmt extensively study mechanism transport drug brain endothelial cell brain parenchyma advance material science nanotechnology facilitate development multifunctional carrier optimized property improve drug targeting stability release profile brain review summarize physiological structure bbb highlight recent innovation rmt- tmt mediate brain drug delivery system emphasize potential overcome current challenge cns drug development pave way generation therapy enable precise effective personalize treatment brain relate disease

A total of 79 male outfield players participated in 62 official matches across 3 competitive phases of the Spanish National CP Football League (Regular Phase, Consolation Phase, and Playoffs) and the IFCPF World Cup. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) were used to record locomotor and technical variables during each match. A subset of 10 players was tracked across all phases. Physical demands were normalized per minute of play and analyzed using one-way and repeated-measures ANOVAs. Results revealed that physical requirements during the World Cup were up to three times higher than during national-level matches, with significantly greater maximum velocities, high-intensity distances, and frequencies of accelerations and decelerations (<i>p</i> < 0.001, ηp<sup>2</sup> > 0.40). Playoffs also imposed significantly greater physical requirements compared to Regular and Consolation Phases. International matches showed a markedly higher number of ball contacts, indicating increased technical involvement. These patterns were consistent in both the full sample and the longitudinal subsample, suggesting that competitive level-rather than player characteristics alone- strongly modulates physical output during the competition.

40573619,Use of Smartphones and Wrist-Worn Devices for Motor Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review of Commercially Available Technologies.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. The accurate and continuous monitoring of these symptoms is essential for optimizing treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. Traditionally, clinical assessments have relied on scales and methods that often lack the ability for continuous, real-time monitoring and can be subject to interpretation bias. Recent advancements in wearable technologies, such as smartphones, smartwatches, and activity trackers (ATs), present a promising alternative for more consistent and objective monitoring. This review aims to evaluate the use of smartphones and smart wrist devices, like smartwatches and activity trackers, in the management of PD, assessing their effectiveness in symptom evaluation and monitoring and physical performance improvement.

40573601,Parkinson's Disease Detection via Bilateral Gait Camera Sensor Fusion Using CMSA-Net and Implementation on Portable Device.,"The annual increase in the incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD) underscores the critical need for effective detection methods and devices. Gait video features based on camera sensors, as a crucial biomarker for PD, are well-suited for detection and show promise for the development of portable devices. Consequently, we developed a single-step segmentation method based on Savitzky-Golay (SG) filtering and a sliding window peak selection function, along with a Cross-Attention Fusion with Mamba-2 and Self-Attention Network (CMSA-Net). Additionally, we introduced a loss function based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to further enhance the fusion process. We evaluated our method on a dual-view gait video dataset that we collected in collaboration with a hospital, comprising 304 healthy control (HC) samples and 84 PD samples, achieving an accuracy of 89.10% and an F1-score of 81.11%, thereby attaining the best detection performance compared with other methods. Based on these methodologies, we designed a simple and user-friendly portable PD detection device. The device is equipped with various operating modes-including single-view, dual-view, and prior information correction-which enable it to adapt to diverse environments, such as residential and elder care settings, thereby demonstrating strong practical applicability.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2025.0,Jinxuan Wang; Hua Huo; Wei Liu; Changwei Zhao; Shilu Kang; Lan Ma,annual increase incidence parkinson disease pd underscore critical need effective detection method device gait video feature base camera sensor crucial biomarker pd suited detection promise development portable device consequently develop single step segmentation method base savitzky golay sg filtering slide window peak selection function cross attention fusion mamba-2 self attention network cmsa net additionally introduce loss function base maximum mean discrepancy mmd enhance fusion process evaluate method dual view gait video dataset collect collaboration hospital comprise 304 healthy control hc sample 84 pd sample achieve accuracy 89.10 f1 score 81.11 attain good detection performance compare method base methodology design simple user friendly portable pd detection device device equip operating mode include single view dual view prior information correction enable adapt diverse environment residential elder care setting demonstrate strong practical applicability
40573581,Evaluating the Usability of Inertial Measurement Units for Measuring and Monitoring Activity Post-Stroke: A Scoping Review.,"Stroke is the most common cause of disability in adults, resulting in declines in overall activity. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) allow for the monitoring of activity patterns in various settings, informing clinical interventions and patient self-management. This review aimed to synthesize existing research evaluating the usability of IMUs for monitoring activity in people with stroke. This scoping review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. The MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases were searched for publications evaluating the usability of IMUs for monitoring activity post-stroke. Fourteen publications met the inclusion criteria. Most studies were conducted in chronic stroke with data collected in real-world conditions. Usability findings indicated that most stroke participants and clinicians reported a positive user experience; however many reported difficulties with devices due to stroke-related impairments. Importantly, the interpretation of this finding was impacted by poorly reported impairments of stroke participants. Only a few studies evaluated end-user experiences (people with stroke and clinicians) in interpreting and engaging with feedback based on data from IMUs. Future usability studies in stroke populations should aim to understand participant characteristics that influence device engagement, with a focus on user experience in interpreting device-generated metrics.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2025.0,Aishwarya Shenoy; Manvir Singh Samra; Karen Van Ooteghem; Kit B Beyer; Sherri Thomson; William E McIlroy; Janice J Eng; Courtney L Pollock,stroke common cause disability adult result decline overall activity inertial measurement unit imus allow monitoring activity pattern setting inform clinical intervention patient self management review aim synthesize exist research evaluate usability imu monitor activity people stroke scope review conduct accord prisma guideline medline embase cinahl database search publication evaluate usability imu monitor activity post stroke fourteen publication meet inclusion criterion study conduct chronic stroke datum collect real world condition usability finding indicate stroke participant clinician report positive user experience report difficulty device stroke relate impairment importantly interpretation finding impact poorly report impairment stroke participant study evaluate end user experience people stroke clinician interpret engage feedback base datum imu future usability study stroke population aim understand participant characteristic influence device engagement focus user experience interpret device generate metric
40573553,A Novel Bilateral Data Fusion Approach for EMG-Driven Deep Learning in Post-Stroke Paretic Gesture Recognition.,"We introduce a hybrid deep learning model for recognizing hand gestures from electromyography (EMG) signals in subacute stroke patients: the one-dimensional convolutional long short-term memory neural network (CNN-LSTM). The proposed network was trained, tested, and cross-validated on seven hand gesture movements, collected via EMG from 25 patients exhibiting clinical features of paresis. EMG data from these patients were collected twice post-stroke, at least one week apart, and divided into datasets A and B to assess performance over time while balancing subject-specific content and minimizing training bias. Dataset A had a median post-stroke time of 16.0 ± 8.6 days, while dataset B had a median of 19.2 ± 13.7 days. In classification tests based on the number of gesture classes (ranging from two to seven), the hybrid model achieved accuracies ranging from 85.66% to 82.27% in dataset A and from 88.36% to 81.69% in dataset B. To address the limitations of deep learning with small datasets, we developed a novel bilateral data fusion approach that incorporates EMG signals from the non-paretic limb during training. This approach significantly enhanced model performance across both datasets, as evidenced by improvements in sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and F1-score metrics. The most substantial gains were observed in the three-gesture subset, where classification accuracy increased from 73.01% to 78.42% in dataset A, and from 77.95% to 85.69% in dataset B. In conclusion, although these results may be slightly lower than those of traditional supervised learning algorithms, the combination of bilateral data fusion and the absence of feature engineering offers a novel perspective for neurorehabilitation, where every data segment is critically significant.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2025.0,Alexey Anastasiev; Hideki Kadone; Aiki Marushima; Hiroki Watanabe; Alexander Zaboronok; Shinya Watanabe; Akira Matsumura; Kenji Suzuki; Yuji Matsumaru; Hiroyuki Nishiyama; Eiichi Ishikawa,introduce hybrid deep learning model recognize hand gesture electromyography emg signal subacute stroke patient dimensional convolutional long short term memory neural network cnn lstm propose network train test cross validated seven hand gesture movement collect emg 25 patient exhibit clinical feature paresis emg datum patient collect twice post stroke week apart divide dataset b assess performance time balance subject specific content minimize training bias dataset median post stroke time 16.0 ± 8.6 day dataset b median 19.2 ± 13.7 day classification test base number gesture class range seven hybrid model achieve accuracy range 85.66 82.27 dataset 88.36 81.69 dataset b. address limitation deep learning small dataset develop novel bilateral datum fusion approach incorporate emg signal non paretic limb training approach significantly enhanced model performance dataset evidence improvement sensitivity specificity accuracy f1 score metric substantial gain observe gesture subset classification accuracy increase 73.01 78.42 dataset 77.95 85.69 dataset b. conclusion result slightly low traditional supervised learning algorithm combination bilateral datum fusion absence feature engineering offer novel perspective neurorehabilitation datum segment critically significant
40573532,Efficient Brain Tumor Segmentation for MRI Images Using YOLO-BT.,"Aiming at the problems of inaccurate segmentation and low detection efficiency caused by irregular tumor shape and large size differences in brain MRI images, this study proposes a brain tumor segmentation algorithm, YOLO-BT, based on YOLOv11. YOLO-BT uses UNetV2 as the backbone network to enhance the feature extraction ability of key regions through the attention mechanism. The BiFPN structure is introduced into the neck network to replace the traditional feature splicing method, realize the two-way fusion of cross-scale features, improve detection accuracy, and reduce the amount of calculations required. The D-LKA mechanism is introduced into the C3k2 structure, and the large convolution kernel is used to process complex image information to enhance the model's ability to characterize different scales and irregular tumors. In this study, multiple sets of experiments were performed on the Figshare Brain Tumor dataset to test the performance of YOLO-BT. The data results show that YOLO-BT improves Precision by 2.7%, Recall, mAP50 by 0.9%, and mAP50-95 by 0.3% in the candidate box-based evaluation compared to YOLOv11. In mask-based evaluations, Precision improved by 2.5%, Recall by 2.8%, mAP50 by 1.1%, and mAP50-95 by 0.5%. At the same time, the mIOU increased by 6.1%, and the Dice coefficient increased by 3.6%. It can be seen that the YOLO-BT algorithm is suitable for brain tumor detection and segmentation.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2025.0,Mengying Xiong; Aiping Wu; Yue Yang; Qingqing Fu,aim problem inaccurate segmentation low detection efficiency cause irregular tumor shape large size difference brain mri image study propose brain tumor segmentation algorithm yolo bt base yolov11 yolo bt use unetv2 backbone network enhance feature extraction ability key region attention mechanism bifpn structure introduce neck network replace traditional feature splicing method realize way fusion cross scale feature improve detection accuracy reduce calculation require d lka mechanism introduce c3k2 structure large convolution kernel process complex image information enhance model ability characterize different scale irregular tumor study multiple set experiment perform figshare brain tumor dataset test performance yolo bt data result yolo bt improve precision 2.7 recall map50 0.9 map50 95 0.3 candidate box base evaluation compare yolov11 mask base evaluation precision improve 2.5 recall 2.8 map50 1.1 map50 95 0.5 time miou increase 6.1 dice coefficient increase 3.6 see yolo bt algorithm suitable brain tumor detection segmentation
40573514,Wide-Based Illumination and Detection in Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy for Enhanced Seizure Detection in Grey Matter.,"Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive method for monitoring brain activity by detecting hemodynamic changes. Studies have shown that it can identify ictal and pre-ictal hemodynamic variations, supporting its potential use as a complement to electroencephalography (EEG) in epilepsy monitoring. This study explores an expanded illumination and detection approach utilizing wide-based optodes and increased emitter-detector separation (EDS) to enhance fNIRS sensitivity to cortical hemodynamic changes while minimizing scalp contamination. A Monte Carlo simulation was designed to assess signal amplitude and sensitivity of fNIRS with varying emitter and detector diameters (1-15 mm) and EDS (30-50 mm). Signal strength, grey matter to scalp path ratio (GSPR), and percentage signal change per absorption coefficients (AC) variation were analyzed. Sensitivity to changes in AC of superficial and deep grey matter (SGM, DGM) and scalp was assessed. Increasing emitter and detector diameters substantially increased total detected photon packet weights, enabling practical use at larger EDS. Sensitivity to SGM AC changes tripled at 50 mm EDS, while GSPR increased by 80%, indicating reduced signal contamination from the scalp. Sensitivity to deep cortical hemodynamic changes also improved. Therefore, wide-based fNIRS optodes with increased EDS can enhance seizure-related hemodynamic detection, potentially improving epilepsy diagnostics.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2025.0,Netaniel Rein; Revital Shechter; Evgeny Tsizin; Mordekhay Medvedovsky; Michal Balberg,functional near infrared spectroscopy fnirs non invasive method monitor brain activity detect hemodynamic change study show identify ictal pre ictal hemodynamic variation support potential use complement electroencephalography eeg epilepsy monitoring study explore expand illumination detection approach utilize wide base optode increase emitter detector separation eds enhance fnirs sensitivity cortical hemodynamic change minimize scalp contamination monte carlo simulation design assess signal amplitude sensitivity fnirs vary emitter detector diameter 1 15 mm eds 30 50 mm signal strength grey matter scalp path ratio gspr percentage signal change absorption coefficient ac variation analyze sensitivity change ac superficial deep grey matter sgm dgm scalp assess increase emitter detector diameter substantially increase total detect photon packet weight enable practical use large eds sensitivity sgm ac change triple 50 mm eds gspr increase 80 indicate reduce signal contamination scalp sensitivity deep cortical hemodynamic change improve wide base fnirs optode increase eds enhance seizure relate hemodynamic detection potentially improve epilepsy diagnostic
40573505,Characterizing Neurocardiovascular Responses to an Active Stand Test in Older Women: A Pilot Study Using Functional Data Analysis.,"This observational pilot study investigated neurocardiovascular responses to an active stand test using continuous physiological monitoring and functional data analysis (FDA) in older women. A sample of 25 community-dwelling female adults aged 59-78 years (mean age: 70.3 years) participated. Participants were dichotomized into comparison groups based on five factors: age (<70 vs. ≥70 years); the presence of initial orthostatic hypotension (IOH, yes/no); body mass index (BMI < 25 vs. ≥25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>); antihypertensive medication use (yes/no); and physical frailty status assessed by the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe-Frailty Instrument (SHARE-FI score < -0.5 vs. ≥-0.5). Each participant completed an active stand test during which six physiological signals were continuously recorded: systolic (sBP) and diastolic (dBP) blood pressure and heart rate (HR) via digital artery photoplethysmography and left frontal oxygenated hemoglobin (O<sub>2</sub>Hb), deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb), and tissue saturation index (TSI) via near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The signal analysis focused on a standardized 200 s window spanning 50 s before to 150 s after the stand, with all signals resampled and synchronized at 5 Hz. FDA was used to statistically compare the full time series between groups for each signal. Group-level differences revealed that younger participants (<70 years) exhibited significantly higher HR in multiple periods following the stand (~10 s, ~30 s, ~90 s, and ~140 s post-stand) compared to their older counterparts. Participants with IOH demonstrated significantly lower sBP at ~10 s, ~80 s, and ~130 s post-stand and lower dBP at ~10 s post-stand. Among participants classified as overweight/obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), significantly lower levels of HHb were observed at ~10 s, ~30-50 s, and ~60 s post-stand, while O<sub>2</sub>Hb levels were reduced at ~50 s, ~60 s, ~70-110 s, ~130 s, and ~140 s post-stand. No statistically significant group-level differences were observed based on antihypertensive medication use or frailty status. These findings demonstrate the utility of FDA in detecting subtle, time-dependent physiological variations during orthostatic challenge and underscore the value of continuous neurocardiovascular monitoring in assessing orthostatic tolerance in aging populations.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2025.0,Feng Xue; Roman Romero-Ortuno,observational pilot study investigate neurocardiovascular response active stand test continuous physiological monitoring functional datum analysis fda old woman sample 25 community dwell female adult age 59 78 year mean age 70.3 year participate participant dichotomize comparison group base factor age < 70 vs. ≥70 year presence initial orthostatic hypotension ioh yes body mass index bmi < 25 vs. ≥25 kg m < sup>2</sup > antihypertensive medication use yes physical frailty status assess survey health ageing retirement europe frailty instrument share fi score < -0.5 vs. ≥-0.5 participant complete active stand test physiological signal continuously record systolic sbp diastolic dbp blood pressure heart rate hr digital artery photoplethysmography leave frontal oxygenate hemoglobin o < sub>2</sub > hb deoxygenated hemoglobin hhb tissue saturation index tsi near infrared spectroscopy nirs signal analysis focus standardized 200 s window span 50 s 150 s stand signal resample synchronize 5 hz fda statistically compare time series group signal group level difference reveal young participant < 70 year exhibit significantly high hr multiple period follow stand ~10 s ~30 s ~90 s ~140 s post stand compare old counterpart participant ioh demonstrate significantly low sbp ~10 s ~80 s ~130 s post stand low dbp ~10 s post stand participant classify overweight obese bmi ≥ 25 kg m < sup>2</sup > significantly low level hhb observe ~10 s ~30 50 s ~60 s post stand o < sub>2</sub > hb level reduce ~50 s ~60 s ~70 110 s ~130 s ~140 s post stand statistically significant group level difference observe base antihypertensive medication use frailty status finding demonstrate utility fda detect subtle time dependent physiological variation orthostatic challenge underscore value continuous neurocardiovascular monitoring assess orthostatic tolerance age population
40573455,Brainstem Encephalitis: An Atypical Manifestation of Zika Virus Infection in Brazil.,"Zika virus (ZIKV), once considered a relatively benign pathogen, has emerged as a cause of severe neurological complications, including Guillain-Barrè Syndrome and encephalitis. This report presents the case of a 21-year-old Brazilian woman who initially presented with fever, rash, and arthralgia. Seven days later, she developed confusion, speech impairment, and gait disturbance. Following a tonic-clonic seizure, neurological examination revealed dysphonia, dysarthria and facial palsy, suggestive of brainstem involvement. ZIKV infection was detected by positive IgM serology and a plaque reduction neutralization test. The patient was treated with corticosteroids and antiepileptic drugs, leading to substantial clinical improvement, and discharge after 25 days of hospitalization. This case underscores the neuroinvasive potential of ZIKV and highlights the importance of early recognition and management of atypical neurological manifestations.

40573437,Re-Emergence of Usutu Virus and Spreading of West Nile Virus Neuroinvasive Infections During the 2024 Transmission Season in Croatia.,"Neuroinvasive arboviruses such as tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), West Nile virus (WNV), Usutu virus (USUV), and Toscana virus (TOSV) have (re-)emerged with increasing incidence and geographic range. We analyzed the epidemiology of arboviral infections in Croatia during the 2024 transmission season. A total of 154 patients with neuroinvasive diseases (NID), 1596 horses, 69 dead birds, and 7726 mosquitoes were tested. Viral RNA was detected using RT-qPCR. IgM/IgG-specific antibodies were detected using commercial ELISA or IFA, with confirmation of cross-reactive samples by virus neutralization test. RT-qPCR-positive samples were Sanger sequenced. Arboviral etiology was confirmed in 33/21.42% of patients with NID. WNV was most frequently detected (17/11.03%), followed by TBEV (10/6.49%), USUV (5/3.24%), and TOSV (1/0.64%). WNV infections were reported in regions previously known as endemic, while in one continental county, WNV was recorded for the first time. USUV infections re-emerged after a six-year absence. In addition to human cases, acute WNV infections were recorded in 11/395 (2.78%) of horses and two dead crows. WNV IgG seropositivity was detected in 276/1168 (23.63%) and TBEV IgG seropositivity in 68/428 (15.88%) horses. None of the tested mosquito pools were positive for WNV and USUV RNA. Phylogenetic analysis showed the circulation of WNV lineage 2 and Usutu Europe 2 lineage. Climate conditions in 2024 in Croatia were classified as extremely warm, which could, at least in part, impact the quite intense arboviral season.

40573436,A Scoping Review of Preclinical Research on Monoclonal Antibody Development for Prophylaxis and Treatment of West Nile Virus Infections.,"West Nile virus (WNV) causes thousands of arboviral infections in the United States each year. Patients with immune-compromising conditions and elderly people are at higher risk of severe WNV neuroinvasive disease (WNND). Despite its broad endemicity nationwide, no U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccine or therapeutic treatments exist. We summarized existing peer-reviewed literature on the preclinical development of monoclonal antibody (MAb) prophylaxis and therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of WNND. Five bibliographical databases (CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Embase, MEDLINE, and Scopus) were searched for applicable research studies performed from 1 January 1998 to 1 May 2025. In total, 2347 titles and abstracts were screened, 263 full-text publications reviewed, and 25 studies included. Studies included detailed preclinical development and evaluations of MAbs targeting the envelope (E) protein (<i>n</i> = 13), other viral proteins (<i>n</i> = 3), flaviviral cross-protective monoclonal antibodies (<i>n</i> = 4), and novel antibody configurations or delivery methods (<i>n</i> = 5). The most well-studied MAb, E16, targeting E- Domain III (E-DIII), was effective at inhibiting and treating WNND in experimental animal models.

40573435,Ten Previously Unassigned Human Cosavirus Genotypes Detected in Feces of Children with Non-Polio Acute Flaccid Paralysis in Nigeria in 2020.,"Since its discovery via metagenomics in 2008, human cosavirus (HCoSV) has been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and feces of humans with meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), and acute gastroenteritis. To date, 34 HCoSV genotypes have been documented by the <i>Picornaviridae</i> study group. However, the documented genetic diversity of HCoSV in Nigeria is limited. Here we describe the genetic diversity of HCoSV in Nigeria using a metagenomics approach. Archived and anonymized fecal specimens from children (under 15 years old) diagnosed with non-polio AFP from five states in Nigeria were analyzed. Virus-like particles were purified from 55 pools (made from 254 samples) using the NetoVIR protocol. Pools were subjected to nucleic acid extraction and metagenomic sequencing. Reads were trimmed and assembled, and contigs classified as HCoSV were subjected to phylogenetic, pairwise identity, recombination analysis, and, when necessary, immuno-informatics and capsid structure prediction. Fifteen pools yielded 23 genomes of HCoSV. Phylogenetic and pairwise identity analysis showed that all belonged to four species (eleven, three, three, and six members of <i>Cosavirus asiani</i>, <i>Cosavirus bepakis</i>, <i>Cosavirus depakis</i>, and <i>Cosavirus eaustrali</i>, respectively) and seventeen genotypes. Ten genomes belong to seven (HCoSV-A3/A10, A15, A17, A19, A24, D3, and E1) previously assigned genotypes, while the remaining thirteen genomes belonged to ten newly proposed genotypes across the four HCoSV species, based on the near-complete VP1 region (VP1*) of the cosavirus genome. Our analysis suggests the existence of at least seven and eight <i>Cosavirus bepakis</i> and <i>Cosavirus eaustrali</i> genotypes, respectively (including those described here). We report the first near-complete genomes of <i>Cosavirus bepakis</i> and <i>Cosavirus depakis</i> from Nigeria, which contributes to the increasing knowledge of the diversity of HCoSV, raising the number of tentative genotypes from 34 to over 40. Our findings suggest that the genetic diversity of HCoSV might be broader than is currently documented, highlighting the need for enhanced surveillance.",Viruses,2025.0,Toluwani Goodnews Ajileye; Toluwanimi Emmanuel Akinleye; Temitope O C Faleye; Lander De Coninck; Uwem Etop George; Anyebe Bernard Onoja; Sheriff Tunde Agbaje; Ijeoma Maryjoy Ifeorah; Oluseyi Adebowale Olayinka; Elijah Igbekele Oni; Arthur Obinna Oragwa; Bolutife Olubukola Popoola; Olaitan Titilola Olayinka; Oluwadamilola Gideon Osasona; Oluwadamilola Adefunke George; Philip G Ajayi; Adedolapo A Suleiman; Ahmed Iluoreh Muhammad; Isaac Komolafe; Adekunle Johnson Adeniji; Jelle Matthijnssens; Moses Olubusuyi Adewumi,discovery metagenomic 2008 human cosavirus hcosv detect cerebrospinal fluid csf fece human meningitis acute flaccid paralysis afp acute gastroenteritis date 34 hcosv genotype document < > picornaviridae</i > study group document genetic diversity hcosv nigeria limited describe genetic diversity hcosv nigeria metagenomic approach archive anonymize fecal specimen child 15 year old diagnose non polio afp state nigeria analyze virus like particle purify 55 pool 254 sample netovir protocol pool subject nucleic acid extraction metagenomic sequencing read trim assemble contig classify hcosv subject phylogenetic pairwise identity recombination analysis necessary immuno informatic capsid structure prediction pool yield 23 genome hcosv phylogenetic pairwise identity analysis show belong specie member < > cosavirus asiani</i > < > cosavirus bepakis</i > < > cosavirus depakis</i > < > cosavirus eaustrali</i > respectively seventeen genotype genome belong seven hcosv a3 a10 a15 a17 a19 a24 d3 e1 previously assign genotype remain thirteen genome belong newly propose genotype hcosv specie base near complete vp1 region vp1 cosavirus genome analysis suggest existence seven < > cosavirus bepakis</i > < > cosavirus eaustrali</i > genotype respectively include describe report near complete genome < > cosavirus bepakis</i > < > cosavirus depakis</i > nigeria contribute increase knowledge diversity hcosv raise number tentative genotype 34 40 finding suggest genetic diversity hcosv broad currently document highlight need enhanced surveillance
40573411,Neurological Manifestation of Canine Distemper Virus: Increased Risk in Young Shih Tzu and Lhasa Apso with Seasonal Prevalence in Autumn.,"Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a highly contagious disease with high morbidity and mortality rates in veterinary medicine. This retrospective study aimed to identify epidemiological characteristics and potential risk factors associated with CDV infection in dogs exhibiting neurological manifestations. The diagnosis was confirmed through immunochromatographic antigen testing, RT-PCR, or <i>Lentz corpuscles</i> identification. Dogs diagnosed with central nervous system (CNS) disorders unrelated to CDV served as the control group. Age, breed, weight, sex, and neuter status were compared between groups using logistic regression (<i>p</i> < 0.05), the log-likelihood method, and log odds ratio (LOR) calculations. Clinical signs, seasonality, and vaccination protocols were documented. Prevalence, mortality, lethality, and survival rates were determined. Younger dogs (<i>p</i> = 0.00690; LOR = -0.01438) and Shih Tzu (<i>p</i> = 0.00007; LOR = 1.53774) and Lhasa Apso (<i>p</i> = 0.000264; LOR = 1.76084) showed a significantly increased likelihood of developing neurological signs due to CDV infection. Most CDV-infected dogs exhibited multifocal CNS involvement and accompanying extra-neural signs. The highest occurrence of CDV-related neurological signs was recorded in autumn.

40573406,Spatiotemporal Distribution and Host-Vector Dynamics of Japanese Encephalitis Virus.,"Japanese encephalitis (JE), a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), remains a significant public health threat in Asia. Although vaccination programs have successfully reduced the incidence of JE, challenges persist in the adult population, and the emergence of rare JEV genotypes poses additional risks. In this study, a phylogenetic analysis of the whole JEV genome sequence, along with a temporal-spatial analysis of isolates and a host-vector analysis, was used to examine the changes in JEV transmission dynamics before and after 2012. The results revealed persistent differences between the dominant G1 and G3 genotypes, as well as the re-emergence of G4 and G5 genotypes. Although JEV has been detected in non-traditional vectors and atypical mammalian hosts, <i>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</i> and pigs remain the primary vector and amplifying host, respectively.

40573401,Validated Methods for Inactivation of Tick-Borne Encephalitis Virus Compatible with Immune-Based and Enzymatic Downstream Analyses.,"Tick-Borne Encephalitis Virus (TBEV) is impacting public health in the Eurasian region, with increasing case numbers. There is, therefore, a need to expand research efforts and the corresponding infrastructure capacity. Since TBEV is classified as a risk group 3 organism in Switzerland, handling infectious material containing the virus is restricted to biosafety level 3 laboratories. In some instances, downstream analyses may need to be performed outside of the containment facility. It is, therefore, essential to validate effective inactivation protocols compatible with the safe and accurate processing of samples. This study evaluated UV irradiation, chemical treatment with detergents, and mechanical filtration as candidate methods to inactivate TBEV infectious samples, including culture supernatants and tissue homogenates, while preserving their compatibility for different assays. Among the methods tested, 45 s of UV irradiation or Triton-X100 at concentrations between 0.05% and 0.1% effectively inactivated TBEV while mostly preserving the integrity of the processed samples for immuno- or enzymatic assays. These findings establish safe and reliable procedures for advancing TBEV research beyond high-containment settings.",Viruses,2025.0,Simone Leoni; Stephen L Leib; Katharina Summermatter; Denis Grandgirard,tick borne encephalitis virus tbev impact public health eurasian region increase case number need expand research effort correspond infrastructure capacity tbev classify risk group 3 organism switzerland handle infectious material contain virus restrict biosafety level 3 laboratory instance downstream analysis need perform outside containment facility essential validate effective inactivation protocol compatible safe accurate processing sample study evaluate uv irradiation chemical treatment detergent mechanical filtration candidate method inactivate tbev infectious sample include culture supernatant tissue homogenate preserve compatibility different assay method test 45 s uv irradiation triton x100 concentration 0.05 0.1 effectively inactivate tbev preserve integrity process sample immuno- enzymatic assay finding establish safe reliable procedure advance tbev research high containment setting

40573374,SARS-CoV-2 (MA10) Infection Aggravates Cerebrovascular Pathology in Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase-Deficient Mice.,"SARS-CoV-2 can cause neurological issues, including cognitive dysfunction in COVID-19 survivors. Endothelial dysfunction, a key mechanism in COVID-19, is also a risk factor for vascular dementia (VaD). Reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is a pathogenic factor of endothelial dysfunction and platelet aggregation in COVID-19 patients, and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) levels decline with advancing age, a risk factor for both COVID-19 morbidity and VaD. SARS-CoV-2 also induces cellular senescence and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). We hypothesized that eNOS deficiency would worsen neuroinflammation, senescence, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and hypercoagulability in eNOS-deficient mice. Six-month-old eNOS<sup>+/-</sup> (pre-cognitively impaired experimental VaD) and wild-type (WT) male mice were infected with mouse-adapted (MA10) SARS-CoV-2. Mice were evaluated for weight loss, viral load, and markers of inflammation and senescence 3 days post-infection. eNOS<sup>+/-</sup> mice showed more weight loss (~15%) compared to WT mice (~5%) and increased inflammatory markers (<i>Ccl2</i>, <i>Cxcl9</i>, <i>Cxcl10</i>, <i>IL-1β</i>, and <i>IL-6</i>) and senescence markers (p53 and p21). They also exhibited higher microglial activation (Iba1) and increased plasma coagulation and BBB permeability, despite comparable lung viral loads and absence of virus in the brain.

40573350,Development of a Noninfectious Japanese Encephalitis Virus Replicon for Antiviral Drug Screening and Gene Function Studies.,"Viral replicons are efficient tools to understand the mechanisms of viral replication and screen antiviral drugs. In this study, a viral-cDNA-based replicon of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), which is the causative agent of Japanese encephalitis, was constructed by replacing the viral structural proteins with a green fluorescent protein (JEV-GFP replicon). The resulting JEV-GFP replicon was used as a tool to screen antiviral drugs targeting JEV nonstructural proteins, and the five compounds JNJ-A07, HZ-1157, NITD-2, quinine, and NITD008 were obtained, which significantly inhibited the replication of the JEV-GFP replicon and JEV in vitro, and the properties of these five compounds were also analyzed. The CC<sub>50</sub>, EC<sub>50</sub>, and SI indices of these five compounds were analyzed. In addition, the JEV-GFP replicon was used as a tool to identify the residues of viral nonstructural proteins involved in RNA replication, and the cysteine residue at position 4 of nonstructural protein 1 was found to be essential for JEV RNA replication.

40573339,Relationship Between Estimated Drug Distribution of Antiretroviral Therapy and Immune Proteins in Cerebrospinal Fluid During Chronic HIV Suppression.,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs vary in their distribution into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which can be estimated using the central nervous system (CNS) penetration effectiveness (CPE) score. Although higher CPE has been associated with lower CSF HIV RNA levels, its relationship to CSF inflammation is less clear. We investigated associations between CPE and three CSF immune biomarkers (CXCL10, TNF-α, and IL-6) in 275 virally suppressed people with HIV (PWH) on three-drug ART regimens using a training-validation design. Participants were randomized into training (TG, n = 144) and validation (VG, n = 131) groups with similar demographics, ART characteristics, and CPE scores. The CSF levels of the biomarkers were quantified by bead suspension array-based immunoassays. In both groups, higher CPE correlated with lower levels of CXCL10 (TG: r = -0.31, <i>p</i> < 0.001; VG: r = -0.30, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and TNF-α (TG: r = -0.19, <i>p</i> = 0.04; VG: r = -0.18, <i>p</i> = 0.03), with remarkably similar effect size. CPE did not correlate with IL-6 in either group. Multivariable models confirmed the associations between higher CPE and both lower CXCL10 (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.16, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and TNF-α (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.07, <i>p</i> = 0.02) in CSF, and supported the relative resistance of IL-6 to ART effects. During suppressive ART, regimens that achieve higher concentrations in the CNS may better reduce some indicators of CSF inflammation (CXCL10 and TNF-α, closely related to the interferon pathway), but they may not fully normalize the neuroimmune environment (IL-6).

40573338,"Supplementary Surveillance of Poliovirus Circulation in the Russian Federation: Results of a Study on Migrant Children of ""Risk Group"".","The detection of ""silent"" poliovirus (PV) circulation among clinically healthy populations is an important component of supplementary surveillance for poliomyelitis. Migrants from countries or regions where polio is endemic, affected by outbreaks, or at risk may contribute to the introduction of PVs of epidemic significance: wild poliovirus type 1, vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs), or poliovirus type 2 into polio-free countries. Migrant children, refugees under 5 years of age, are considered a ""risk group"" in Russia and are subject to testing for PVs. During 2014-2023, guided by the algorithm of virological and molecular investigation of acute flaccid paralysis cases recommended by the WHO, 51,548 migrant children, arriving from 40 countries, were examined. Among 4% of children excreting various cytopathogenic viruses, polio excretors accounted for 20.8%. Among the PVs, PV3 was predominant (41.7%), and PV types 2, 1, and a mixture of PVs accounted for, respectively, 28.2%, 18.8%, and 11.3%. All isolates of PVs 1 and 3 were identified as Sabin-like. The detection of five children excreting epidemically significant PV2 (four VDPV2 and one Sabin-like) required an assessment of the risk of dissemination and additional immunization activities. Among 580 identified isolates of NPEV, the most abundant was the <i>E. betacoxsakie</i> species at 73.8% (CVB1-6, E11, E6, E13, E7). Information on NPEVs expands our knowledge of the spectrum of NPEVs circulating among healthy children worldwide, but its prognostic significance is still unclear.

40573285,Recent Preclinical Evidence on Phytocannabinoids in Neurodegenerative Disorders: A Focus on Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Disease.,"The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a vital biological network essential for maintaining homeostasis and supporting various physiological functions. It comprises cannabinoid receptors, endogenous lipid-based ligands, known as endocannabinoids, as well as metabolic enzymes and associated proteins responsible for regulating their levels within tissues. The ECS plays a central role in modulating processes involving the central nervous system (CNS). Recent studies have highlighted its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. The therapeutic potential of cannabinoids, particularly phytocannabinoids derived from plants, has attracted significant attention in medical and pharmaceutical research. This interest has grown in parallel with the increasing availability of cannabinoid-based food supplements on the pharmaceutical market. Given the complexity of the ECS and its broad range of interactions, the discovery of this system has spurred extensive investigations into the use of cannabinoids for various health conditions. In this review, we examine recent preclinical evidence supporting the use of phytocannabinoids in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Targeting the ECS through phytocannabinoid-based pharmacological modulation offers a promising therapeutic strategy for these neurological disorders. Among these compounds, cannabidiol has emerged as a key focus of research due to its multifaceted effects and favorable safety profile.

A marker compound of enzyme-treated HongJam was also identified to support quality control. <b>Methods and Results</b>: Mice were supplemented with Golden Silk HongJam (GS) or its enzyme hydrolysates (GS-EHS). Behavioral tests showed both improved fear-aggravated memory, with GS-EHS producing similar or greater effects at lower doses. GS-EHS activated the cyclic AMP response element binding protein/brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway and mitigated scopolamine-induced mitochondrial dysfunction by enhancing mitochondrial complex activity and ATP production. It also increased esterase activity, reduced reactive oxygen species, and modulated programmed cell death by suppressing apoptosis while promoting autophagy and unfolded protein response pathways. These changes led to reduced endoplasmic reticulum stress and neuroinflammation. Mass spectrometry identified glycine-tyrosine dipeptide as a potential bioactive marker. <b>Conclusions</b>: GS-EHS enhances cognitive function by improving mitochondrial activity, reducing oxidative stress, and regulating programmed cell death.

40573140,Feeding Challenges in Trisomy 21: Prevalence and Characteristics of Feeding Disorders and Food Neophobia-A Cross-Sectional Study of Polish Children and Adolescents with Down Syndrome.,"Food neophobia, defined as reluctance to try new foods, may lead to nutritional deficiencies and complicate dietary management-especially in individuals with Down syndrome, who often present with oral-motor dysfunction. This condition may result in nutritional deficiencies and difficulties in adhering to dietary recommendations, particularly in individuals with comorbidities. In individuals with Down syndrome (DS), who frequently present with oral motor disorders and chronic diseases, the problem may be especially pronounced. The aim of the study was to assess the risk of food neophobia and feeding difficulties in children, adolescents, and young adults with Down syndrome, as well as their associations with age, gender, and body weight. The research was conducted using the CAWI method among 310 caregivers of individuals with DS in Poland. Two validated tools were employed: the Montreal Children's Hospital Feeding Scale (MCH-FS) and the Food Neophobia Scale for Children (FNSC). Body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, and demographic data were also analyzed. Findings revealed that the majority of participants (55.2%) had normal body weight, while 19.4% were undernourished and 6.5% were classified as obese. Feeding difficulties of moderate to very high severity were reported in 26.5% of the participants. A high risk of food neophobia was identified in 41.3% of respondents, most frequently in the preschool age group. A statistically significant association was observed between age and the severity of both feeding difficulties and neophobia (<i>p</i> < 0.05). However, no significant relationships were found with gender or body weight.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the longitudinal course of BED symptomatology following a group-based DBT intervention focused on two specific modules, Emotion Regulation and Distress Tolerance, and to examine the mediating role of emotion dysregulation and alexithymia in symptom improvement. <b>Methods:</b> This non-randomized longitudinal clinical study involved 170 patients with BED who received a 16-week DBT group treatment including modules targeting emotion regulation and distress tolerance. Self-report questionnaires were administered at baseline (T0) and at the end of treatment (T1). Linear mixed models were used to analyze the longitudinal trend, and a mediation analysis was conducted to examine whether changes in emotion dysregulation and alexithymia mediated symptom improvement. <b>Results:</b> Longitudinal analyses showed a significant reduction in BED symptoms at the end of treatment as well as in the levels of emotion dysregulation and alexithymia. Mediation analyses revealed that both emotion dysregulation (indirect effect: -0.68 [-1.20; -0.31]) and alexithymia (indirect effect: -0.59 [-1.33; -0.20]) significantly mediated the improvement in BED symptoms over time. <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings support the application of focused DBT group interventions targeting emotion regulation and distress tolerance in reducing BED symptomatology.

40573104,"Awareness of Eating Disorders, Nutritional Knowledge, and Emotionally Driven Eating Among Polish Adolescents Aged 15-17-A Pilot Study.","<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Despite the growing awareness of nutrition and the popularity of healthy lifestyles among adolescents, disordered eating behaviors-such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder (BED), and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID)-remain significant public health concerns. ARFID, officially recognized only in 2013, is still poorly understood among youth. This study aimed to assess the relationship between adolescents' nutritional knowledge, emotional regulation, media influence, and eating behaviors. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2024 among 120 students aged 15-17 attending W. Reymont Secondary School No. II in Ostrów Wielkopolski, Poland. Participants completed a custom-designed, paper-based questionnaire consisting of 30 single-choice questions and demographic items. The instrument assessed knowledge of eating disorders, body satisfaction, social media impact, and the emotional determinants of food choices. The tool was developed with expert input but has not undergone formal psychometric validation. While many adolescents demonstrated basic nutritional knowledge-such as awareness of BMI norms and food group distribution-they often failed to apply this knowledge to their dietary behaviors. <b>Results:</b> Significant gender differences were observed: girls were more likely to restrict food intake, report emotional eating, and engage in slimming behaviors, while boys were less emotionally reactive and less influenced by social media. Most participants reported eating one meal daily with family but rarely discussed nutrition at home. Emotional involvement in eating, particularly among girls, emerged as a key factor, more influential than social media in shaping dietary behaviors. <b>Conclusions:</b> The findings highlight a clear gap between nutritional knowledge and actual behavior among adolescents, driven in part by emotional dysregulation and body image concerns.

40573101,<i>Gryllus bimaculatus</i> Hydrolysate Ameliorates Obesity-Induced Muscle Atrophy by Activating Skeletal Muscle AMPK in Mice.,"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Obesity-related metabolic complications contribute to musculoskeletal disorders and are often associated with muscular fat accumulation. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a therapeutic target that can mitigate these effects. <b>Methods</b>: An <i>in vivo</i> study was conducted to understand the effects of <i>Gryllus bimaculatus</i> (GB), a potent AMPK activator, on metabolic and muscular homeostasis in diet-induced obesity (DIO). Six-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed either a normal diet or a high-fat diet (HFD) for eight weeks to induce DIO. Subsequently, HFD-fed mice were divided into four groups: HFD only, HFD with 100 mg/kg/day GB, HFD with 200 mg/kg/day GB, and HFD with 400 mg/kg/day GB for 16 weeks. To assess the effects of GB, we evaluated insulin resistance, muscle strength, muscular fat accumulation, and AMPK activation using an oral glucose tolerance test, grip strength test, histological assessments, serum lipid analyses, western blotting, and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. <b>Results</b>: The low- and mid-dose GB groups showed a trend toward improved insulin resistance. GB significantly reduced muscle fat accumulation and increased muscle strength. The mid- and high-dose GB groups showed a significantly upregulated expression of the molecular markers of mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation in muscle tissues. Additionally, the high-dose GB group activated AMPK and inhibited the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase in the skeletal muscle. <b>Conclusions</b>: The results suggest that GB may serve as a nutraceutical candidate for the management of obesity-associated metabolic complications.",Nutrients,2025.0,Kyungeun Park; Sunyoon Jung; Chunmei Li; Jung-Heun Ha; Yoonhwa Jeong,< b > background objectives</b > obesity relate metabolic complication contribute musculoskeletal disorder associate muscular fat accumulation amp activate protein kinase ampk therapeutic target mitigate effect < b > methods</b > < > vivo</i > study conduct understand effect < > gryllus bimaculatus</i > gb potent ampk activator metabolic muscular homeostasis diet induce obesity dio week old male c57bl/6j mouse feed normal diet high fat diet hfd week induce dio subsequently hfd feed mouse divide group hfd hfd 100 mg kg day gb hfd 200 mg kg day gb hfd 400 mg kg day gb 16 week assess effect gb evaluate insulin resistance muscle strength muscular fat accumulation ampk activation oral glucose tolerance test grip strength test histological assessment serum lipid analysis western blotting quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction < b > results</b > low- mid dose gb group show trend improved insulin resistance gb significantly reduce muscle fat accumulation increase muscle strength mid- high dose gb group show significantly upregulated expression molecular marker mitochondrial biogenesis fatty acid oxidation muscle tissue additionally high dose gb group activate ampk inhibit activity acetyl coa carboxylase skeletal muscle < b > conclusions</b > result suggest gb serve nutraceutical candidate management obesity associate metabolic complication
40573095,Development and Validation of the Psychometric Properties of the FitMIND Foundation Sweets Addiction Scale-A Pilot Study.,"The rising consumption of ultra-processed foods, especially those high in added sugars, poses a growing public health concern. Although several tools exist to assess food addiction, there is a lack of validated instruments specifically designed to measure addiction-like behaviors related to sweet food intake. This study evaluates the psychometric properties of the FitMIND Foundation Sweets Addiction Scale (FFSAS), adapted from the Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 (YFAS 2.0), using data from Polish adults recruited through the FitMIND Foundation. The FFSAS was evaluated by 11 expert judges on four criteria: clarity, content validity, linguistic appropriateness, and construct representativeness. Afterwards, 344 adult volunteers (mean age 40.6 ± 10.7 years, 78% female, mean body mass index (BMI) 27.86 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) completed online FFSAS and provided demographic data, BMI, and self-reported sweets consumption. Internal consistency was assessed with Cronbach's alpha and external validity was examined through Spearman's correlations. Moreover, we conducted Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analyses (EFA and CFA). Content validity of the FFSAS was supported by expert validation. The scale demonstrated good overall internal consistency (α = 0.85), with specific criteria such as tolerance (α = 0.916) and withdrawal (α = 0.914) showing particularly high reliability. The FFSAS total score was moderately correlated with sweets consumption frequency (ρ = 0.39, <i>p</i> < 0.05) and feelings of guilt (ρ = 0.35, <i>p</i> < 0.05). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) revealed a robust three-factor structure, explaining 68.6% of the variance; the individual factors (subscales) derived from this structure demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α ranging from 0.951 to 0.962). Sampling adequacy was high based on Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure (KMO = 0.956). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) indicated suboptimal model fit (Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0.74, Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) = 0.69, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.14), with a significant chi-square test (χ<sup>2</sup> = 3761.76, <i>p</i> < 0.001).

40573090,Association Between Low Omega-6 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Levels and the Development of Delirium in the Coronary Intensive Care Unit.,"<b>Background:</b> Delirium is frequently observed in patients admitted to the intensive care unit, and is associated with mortality and morbidity. Although several studies have reported an association between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and cognitive disorders, the association between PUFA levels and development of delirium in patients with acute cardiovascular disease remains unknown. <b>Objective:</b> This study aimed to clarify the association between PUFA levels and development of delirium in the coronary intensive care unit (CICU). <b>Methods:</b> We enrolled 590 consecutive patients (mean age, 70 ± 14 years) admitted to the CICU of Juntendo University Hospital. Fasting serum PUFA levels were measured within 24 h of admission. Delta-5 desaturase activity was estimated as the ratio of arachidonic acid (AA) to dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA). Furthermore, delirium was defined as patients having a delirium score of ≥4 using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist. <b>Results:</b> Delirium was observed in 55 patients. DGLA levels were significantly lower, and delta-5 desaturase activity was significantly higher in patients with delirium than in those without delirium (both <i>p</i> < 0.001). Conversely, AA alone and omega-3 PUFAs did not differ between the groups. Additionally, DGLA and AA levels, but not omega-3 PUFA levels, were negatively associated; delta-5 desaturase activity was positively associated with the delirium score (both <i>p</i> < 0.001). The duration of delirium was significantly associated with DGLA and AA levels (<i>p</i> = 0.001 and <i>p</i> = 0.004, respectively). Moreover, multivariate analysis showed that decreased DGLA and increased delta-5 desaturase activity remained significant predictors of delirium. <b>Conclusions:</b> Low omega-6 PUFA levels and high delta-5 desaturase activity on admission were significantly associated with the development of delirium in the CICU, indicating that the evaluation of low omega-6 PUFA levels and related enzymes may identify patients at a high risk of developing delirium.",Nutrients,2025.0,Yurina Sugita-Yamaguchi; Tetsuro Miyazaki; Kazunori Shimada; Megumi Shimizu; Shohei Ouchi; Tatsuro Aikawa; Tomoyuki Shiozawa; Kiyoshi Takasu; Masaru Hiki; Shuhei Takahashi; Katsuhiko Sumiyoshi; Tohru Minamino,< b > background:</b > delirium frequently observe patient admit intensive care unit associate mortality morbidity study report association polyunsaturated fatty acid pufa cognitive disorder association pufa level development delirium patient acute cardiovascular disease remain unknown < b > objective:</b > study aim clarify association pufa level development delirium coronary intensive care unit cicu < b > methods:</b > enrol 590 consecutive patient mean age 70 ± 14 year admit cicu juntendo university hospital fast serum pufa level measure 24 h admission delta-5 desaturase activity estimate ratio arachidonic acid aa dihomo gamma linolenic acid dgla furthermore delirium define patient have delirium score ≥4 intensive care delirium screening checklist < b > results:</b > delirium observe 55 patient dgla level significantly low delta-5 desaturase activity significantly high patient delirium delirium < > p</i > < 0.001 conversely aa omega-3 pufa differ group additionally dgla aa level omega-3 pufa level negatively associate delta-5 desaturase activity positively associate delirium score < > p</i > < 0.001 duration delirium significantly associate dgla aa level < > p</i > = 0.001 < > p</i > = 0.004 respectively multivariate analysis show decrease dgla increase delta-5 desaturase activity remain significant predictor delirium < b > conclusions:</b > low omega-6 pufa level high delta-5 desaturase activity admission significantly associate development delirium cicu indicate evaluation low omega-6 pufa level related enzyme identify patient high risk develop delirium
40573080,Iron Deficiency Prevalence in Bulgarian Children with Cerebral Palsy and Autism: A Call for Nutritional Interventions to Support Development.,"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Iron plays an important role in cognitive, behavioral, and motor development. This study aims to assess the iron nutritional status of Bulgarian children with cerebral palsy (CP) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), focusing on iron deficiency (ID) and its impact on children's development. We hypothesized that children with CP and ASD suffer from iron deficiency. <b>Methods</b>: The cross-sectional study includes 95 children from northeastern Bulgaria. Data were collected in two periods (2017-2018 and 2023-2024). Demographic questionnaires, food frequency questionnaires, and laboratory tests for hemoglobin, serum iron, serum ferritin, serum albumin, and CRP were conducted. Anthropometric measurements were evaluated. The Gross Motor Function Classification System scale was used to assess motor function in children with CP. Statistical analysis was performed using Jamovi software, ver. 2.6.44, with a significance level of <i>p</i> < 0.05. <b>Results</b>: Of the 95 children, 62.1% had CP and 37.9% had ASD. Most children had normal hemoglobin and serum iron levels, but 62.7% of those with CP and 36.8% of those with ASD had low serum ferritin levels, indicating latent ID. A higher proportion of children with CP than those with ASD consumed meat daily, while fish was more commonly consumed by children with ASD. Anthropometric data showed delayed growth and lower height-for-age scores in children with CP. <b>Conclusions</b>: The study identifies latent ID in children with CP and ASD.

40573075,Effects of Dietary Interventions on Cognitive Outcomes.,"Cognitive aging is a complex, multifactorial process influenced by genetic, metabolic, and environmental factors. Among modifiable risk factors, nutrition has emerged as a promising target to preserve cognitive function. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the impact of dietary interventions-including specific nutrients and dietary patterns-on cognitive domains (memory, executive function, global cognition) and mental health. Recent findings: multinutrient supplementation, particularly combinations of B vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids, appears beneficial for episodic memory, especially in individuals with metabolic risk or early cognitive impairment. Antioxidant-rich diets and the MIND diet are consistently associated with better memory and global cognitive outcomes in observational studies. Effects on executive function and mental health remain heterogeneous, although subgroups such as those with mild cognitive impairment or depression may derive benefit. Evidence from interventional studies remains limited by methodological variability. In conclusion, dietary interventions offer a safe and promising approach to support cognitive health in aging. Future research should focus on developing personalized, multidomain prevention models tailored to individual risk profiles.",Nutrients,2025.0,Judith Charbit; Jean-Sébastien Vidal; Olivier Hanon,cognitive aging complex multifactorial process influence genetic metabolic environmental factor modifiable risk factor nutrition emerge promising target preserve cognitive function review provide comprehensive overview impact dietary intervention include specific nutrient dietary pattern cognitive domain memory executive function global cognition mental health recent finding multinutrient supplementation particularly combination b vitamin omega-3 fatty acid appear beneficial episodic memory especially individual metabolic risk early cognitive impairment antioxidant rich diet mind diet consistently associate well memory global cognitive outcome observational study effect executive function mental health remain heterogeneous subgroup mild cognitive impairment depression derive benefit evidence interventional study remain limited methodological variability conclusion dietary intervention offer safe promising approach support cognitive health age future research focus develop personalize multidomain prevention model tailor individual risk profile
40573071,Nutrient-Wide Association Study for Dementia Risks: A Prospective Cohort Study in Middle-Aged and Older Adults.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Evidence on associations between nutrients and dementia risk is limited and inconsistent. We aimed to systematically examine associations between 101 dietary nutrients and dementia incidence with a nutrient-wide association study (EWAS). <b>Methods</b>: We analyzed data from 6280 participants aged 50 years and older from the Health and Retirement Study. Levels of nutrient intake were measured with the food frequency questionnaire. Dementia status was assessed with the Lang-Weir Classification of Cognitive Function. In the EWAS analysis, the Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate associations between each nutrient and dementia incidence, adjusting for multiple comparisons with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05. Nutrients passing the EWAS selection were simultaneously included in the elastic net (ENET) regression model to construct a composite nutrient score (CNS), which was calculated as a weighted sum of the nutrients in the ENET regression model. <b>Results</b>: Over a mean (SD) follow-up of 6.76 (2.14) years, 495 individuals with incident dementia were identified. The results suggested that six nutrients were associated with increased dementia risks and five with decreased dementia risks. Compared with participants at the first tertile of CNS, individuals at the second (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11 to 1.84) and third tertiles (HR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.42 to 2.27) had increased risks of dementia.

40573061,Association of Oral Frailty with Physical Frailty and Malnutrition in Patients on Peritoneal Dialysis.,"<b>Background</b>: Oral frailty is a state between normal oral function and oral hypofunction. Oral frailty progresses to oral hypofunction and dysphagia, which leads to malnutrition, and then to physical frailty and sarcopenia. Oral frailty is reported to be associated with physical frailty and malnutrition in hemodialysis patients, but there have been no reports on peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. <b>Methods</b>: This prospective cohort study investigated the associations of oral frailty with physical frailty, sarcopenia, and malnutrition in patients on PD. Patients were divided into an oral frailty group and a non-oral frailty group according to the Oral Frailty Index-8. Patients were assessed for physical frailty, sarcopenia, and malnutrition at baseline and 1 year later, and changes in each measure were compared between the two groups. Physical frailty was assessed using the Revised Japanese version of the Cardiovascular Health Study Criteria (Revised J-CHS) and the FRAIL scale. Sarcopenia was assessed using the diagnostic criteria reported by the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia in 2019 (AWGS2019 criteria) and the Screening Tool for Sarcopenia Combined with Calf Circumference (SARC-CalF), skeletal muscle index (SMI), calf circumference (CC), grip strength, and gait speed. Nutritional status was assessed with the Short-Form Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA-SF), the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST), the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria, weight, and body mass index (BMI). <b>Results</b>: Of the 58 eligible patients, 51 completed the study. The oral frailty group was significantly older and had slower gait speed, fewer teeth, higher intact parathyroid hormone, higher C-reactive protein, higher frequency of cardiovascular disease, and lower employment at baseline. The oral frailty group had significantly worse physical frailty (Revised J-CHS, <i>p</i> = 0.047; FRAIL scale, <i>p</i> = 0.012), sarcopenia (SMI, <i>p</i> = 0.018; CC, <i>p</i> = 0.002), and nutritional status (MNA-SF, <i>p</i> = 0.029; MUST, <i>p</i> = 0.005; GLIM criteria, <i>p</i> = 0.022; weight, <i>p</i> < 0.001; BMI, <i>p</i> < 0.001). However, there were no significant differences in the worsening of sarcopenia (AWGS2019 criteria, SARC-CalF, grip strength, and gait speed). <b>Conclusions</b>: Oral frailty in patients on PD was associated with the development and progression of physical frailty and malnutrition, and may be associated with the development and progression of sarcopenia.",Nutrients,2025.0,Yu Kobayashi; Tomomi Matsuoka; Ryo Yamaguchi; Kiyomi Ichijo; Miya Suzuki; Tomoyuki Saito; Kimihiro Igarashi; Tokiko Sato; Hiroyuki Takashima; Masanori Abe,< b > background</b > oral frailty state normal oral function oral hypofunction oral frailty progress oral hypofunction dysphagia lead malnutrition physical frailty sarcopenia oral frailty report associate physical frailty malnutrition hemodialysis patient report peritoneal dialysis pd patient < b > methods</b > prospective cohort study investigate association oral frailty physical frailty sarcopenia malnutrition patient pd patient divide oral frailty group non oral frailty group accord oral frailty index-8 patient assess physical frailty sarcopenia malnutrition baseline 1 year later change measure compare group physical frailty assess revise japanese version cardiovascular health study criteria revised j chs frail scale sarcopenia assess diagnostic criterion report asian working group sarcopenia 2019 awgs2019 criterion screening tool sarcopenia combine calf circumference sarc calf skeletal muscle index smi calf circumference cc grip strength gait speed nutritional status assess short form mini nutritional assessment mna sf malnutrition universal screening tool global leadership initiative malnutrition glim criterion weight body mass index bmi < b > results</b > 58 eligible patient 51 complete study oral frailty group significantly old slow gait speed few tooth higher intact parathyroid hormone high c reactive protein high frequency cardiovascular disease low employment baseline oral frailty group significantly bad physical frailty revised j chs < > p</i > = 0.047 frail scale < > p</i > = 0.012 sarcopenia smi < > p</i > = 0.018 cc < > p</i > = 0.002 nutritional status mna sf < > p</i > = 0.029 < > p</i > = 0.005 glim criterion < > p</i > = 0.022 weight < > p</i > < 0.001 bmi < > p</i > < 0.001 significant difference worsening sarcopenia awgs2019 criterion sarc calf grip strength gait speed < b > conclusions</b > oral frailty patient pd associate development progression physical frailty malnutrition associate development progression sarcopenia
40572797,A Comparison of Quantitative Pupillometry and VOMS in Division 1 Female Soccer Players.,"<i>Background and Objectives:</i> Vision uses about half of the pathways within the brain, and these anatomical structures are susceptible to injury in concussion. Authors have suggested that subconcussive head impacts, common in soccer, may disrupt visual function. The following study aimed to explore and compare quantitative pupillometry and Vestibular Ocular Motor Screening (VOMS) in female soccer athletes. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> Twenty-six Division 1 female soccer athletes (20.46 ± 2.36 years) received baseline quantitative pupillometry and VOMS measurements. <i>Results:</i> Of the 26 tested athletes, 3 (11.5%) had clinically significant pupillometry findings at baseline. The mean Neurological Pupil Index or NPi, a composite generated from pupillometry, did not vary: 3.9 ± 0.4 (right eye) and 4.0 ± 0.4 (left eye). No difference in NPi was observed compared to the VOMS score (<i>p</i> > 0.05). Kruskal-Wallis H tests were significant in the right eye for constriction percentage (<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup>(2) = 17.843, <i>p</i> < 0.001, <i>E</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.69) and minimum pupil size (<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup>(2) = 7.976, <i>p</i> = 0.019, <i>E</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.31). A post hoc Dunn test showed significant differences in constriction percentage and minimum pupil size between low NPi and high NPi groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05). One athlete sustained a concussion. NPi was measured within 24 h and was normal, but VOMS was not (total score = 4). <i>Conclusions:</i> The components of pupillometry need more investigation, and there is a need for agreement on concussion-specific cutoffs for quantitative pupillometry for concussion assessment. The lack of a relationship between quantitative pupillometry and VOMS suggests that these tools evaluate different constructs.

40572791,Identifying Predictors of Serious Adverse Events in Antidepressant Treatment from a Decade-Long Nationwide Pharmacovigilance Study: Impact of Dementia and Parkinson's Disease Treatment.,"<i>Backgrounds and Objectives:</i> This study aims to characterize the prevalence and severity of antidepressant-associated adverse drug events (ADEs) and to identify predictors strongly associated with serious adverse events (SAEs). <i>Materials and Methods:</i> Disproportionality analysis on antidepressant-related ADEs spontaneously reported to the Korea Adverse event Reporting System (KIDS KAERS DB) from 2014 to 2023 was performed. Multiple logistic regression was conducted to identify predictors associated with SAEs. Sensitivity analysis was performed to validate the overall findings and assess the robustness of associations across subgroups defined by completeness of demographic data (age and sex), elderly age-stratification, and causality assessment. The study protocol was approved by the Kyung Hee University institutional review board. <i>Results:</i> Among 21,103 antidepressant-related ADEs, duloxetine was the most etiologic medication, followed by amitriptyline and escitalopram. Fluoxetine is the only agent with a high likelihood of reporting SAEs. ADEs involving vascular (extracardiac) disorders (ROR 42.42, 95% CI 13.19-136.42) and liver and biliary system disorders (ROR 7.84, 95% CI 3.77-16.29) were most likely to be SAEs. The predictors associated with substantial increased SAE risk were fluoxetine use (OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.68-4.39), male sex (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.11-1.98), and concomitant administration of antiparkinsonian treatment (OR 8.29, 95% CI 3.61-19.06) and antidementia treatment (OR 2.94, 95% CI 1.34-6.05). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated similar and consistent findings. However, reversed trends in the association between SOC-based ADEs and sex were observed in the sensitivity analysis restricted to cases with ""certain"" and ""probable"" causality. <i>Conclusions:</i> The type of antidepressant, concomitant medications, and sex are major predictors for SAE risk.

40572789,Effects of Antiseizure Medications on Second-Trimester Prenatal Screening Test Parameters: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: The use of antiseizure medications (ASMs) during pregnancy is critical to seizure control in women with epilepsy but raises concerns regarding the use of these drugs and their possible effect on the maternal serum biochemical markers used for second-trimester prenatal screening. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of ASMs on the levels of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), unconjugated estriol (uE3), and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) assessed in the serum biomarker analyses part of second-trimester prenatal screening. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> This retrospective cohort study included 43 pregnant women in the ASM-exposed group (levetiracetam, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, or combined therapy) and 43 matched controls without medication use. Groups were matched based on maternal age, gravidity, parity, abortion history, gestational age at testing, body mass index, and smoking status with propensity score matching. Serum AFP, uE3, and hCG levels measured at 15-20 weeks of gestation were compared between groups. The incidence of fetal congenital anomalies or aneuploidies was also compared between groups. <i>Results</i>: Pregnant women in the ASM-exposed group had significantly higher maternal serum AFP (1.34 ± 0.42 vs. 1.01 ± 0.31 MoM; <i>p</i> < 0.001) and uE3 (1.28 ± 0.39 vs. 1.05 ± 0.34 MoM; <i>p</i> = 0.004) than the controls. However, hCG did not differ significantly between the groups (1.07 ± 0.46 vs. 1.01 ± 0.42 MoM; <i>p</i> = 0.523). Regarding the ASM subgroups (levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine), there were no significant differences in the serum biomarkers (<i>p</i> > 0.05). There was no significant difference between the ASM-exposed and control groups in terms of the incidence of congenital anomalies or aneuploidies (2.3% in the ASM-exposed group vs. 2.3% in the control group; <i>p</i> = 1.000). <i>Conclusions</i>: The use of ASMs during pregnancy significantly alters second-trimester maternal serum biochemical markers, including our primary concerns, AFP and uE3, which could cause inaccurate interpretations of second-trimester prenatal screening. Clinicians should carefully consider maternal medication exposure when interpreting these biochemical markers in pregnant women with epilepsy to prevent the misclassification of fetal risks and avoid unnecessary invasive procedures.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2025.0,Melisa Golgelioglu; Cigdem Akcabay; Gunes Seda Albayrak; Selda Telo,< > background objectives</i > use antiseizure medication asms pregnancy critical seizure control woman epilepsy raise concern use drug possible effect maternal serum biochemical marker second trimester prenatal screening aim study assess effect asm level maternal serum alpha fetoprotein afp unconjugated estriol ue3 human chorionic gonadotropin hcg assess serum biomarker analyse second trimester prenatal screening < > materials methods:</i > retrospective cohort study include 43 pregnant woman asm expose group levetiracetam lamotrigine carbamazepine combine therapy 43 match control medication use group match base maternal age gravidity parity abortion history gestational age testing body mass index smoking status propensity score matching serum afp ue3 hcg level measure 15 20 week gestation compare group incidence fetal congenital anomaly aneuploidy compare group < > results</i > pregnant woman asm expose group significantly high maternal serum afp 1.34 ± 0.42 vs. 1.01 ± 0.31 mom < > p</i > < 0.001 ue3 1.28 ± 0.39 vs. 1.05 ± 0.34 mom < > p</i > = 0.004 control hcg differ significantly group 1.07 ± 0.46 vs. 1.01 ± 0.42 mom < > p</i > = 0.523 asm subgroup levetiracetam lamotrigine carbamazepine significant difference serum biomarker < > p</i > > 0.05 significant difference asm expose control group term incidence congenital anomaly aneuploidy 2.3 asm expose group vs. 2.3 control group < > p</i > = 1.000 < > conclusions</i > use asm pregnancy significantly alter second trimester maternal serum biochemical marker include primary concern afp ue3 cause inaccurate interpretation second trimester prenatal screening clinician carefully consider maternal medication exposure interpret biochemical marker pregnant woman epilepsy prevent misclassification fetal risk avoid unnecessary invasive procedure
40572785,Post-Earthquake PTSD and the Role of Telepsychiatry: A Six-Month Follow-Up Study After the 2023 Kahramanmaraş Earthquakes.,"<i>Background and Objectives:</i> On 6 February 2023, two catastrophic earthquakes struck southeastern Türkiye, affecting over 13 million individuals and causing widespread destruction. While the physical damage was immediate, the psychological consequences-particularly posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression-have proven long-lasting. This study aimed to evaluate the severity and course of PTSD symptoms among survivors and to examine the effectiveness of a telepsychiatry-based mental health intervention in a post-disaster setting. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> This naturalistic, observational study included 153 adult participants from the affected regions who underwent at least two telepsychiatry sessions between the first and sixth month post-disaster. Initial screening was conducted using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and individuals scoring ≥ 13 were further assessed with the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Follow-up evaluations and pharmacological or psychoeducational interventions were offered as clinically indicated. <i>Results:</i> At the one-month follow-up, 94.4% of participants met the threshold for PTSD symptoms (PCL-C > 22) and 77.6% had severe depressive symptoms (BDI > 30). By the sixth month, PTSD symptoms had significantly decreased (mean PCL-C score reduced from 42.47 ± 12.22 to 33.02 ± 12.23, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Greater symptom reduction was associated with higher educational attainment and perceived social support, while prior trauma predicted poorer outcomes. Depression severity emerged as the strongest predictor of chronic PTSD. <i>Conclusions:</i> This study highlights the psychological burden following the 2023 earthquakes in Türkiye and demonstrates the feasibility and potential effectiveness of telepsychiatry in disaster mental health care.

MG has been associated with comorbid conditions, including dyslipidemia (DL), which may exacerbate the clinical burden of MG and impact the overall quality of life. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the prevalence of DL in patients with MG. Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted in the MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. Primary outcomes included the pooled prevalence of DL in MG patients, and the relative risk of DL compared to healthy controls. <i>Results</i>: Nineteen studies involving 98,947 MG patients were analyzed. The pooled prevalence of DL was 23.64% (95% CI: 17.01-30.98). The relative risk of DL in MG patients versus controls was 1.13 (95% CI: 0.53-2.41), indicating no significant increase. Meta-regression revealed a positive correlation between DL prevalence and MG onset age (β = 0.02, <i>p</i> < 0.001), with a 2% rise in DL prevalence per 1-year increase in onset age. Regional subgroup analysis showed a statistical trend of higher DL prevalence in the USA (33.02%) compared to Asia (19.89%) and Europe (17.5%). <i>Conclusions</i>: This study found that approximately one in four MG patients has comorbid DL, with MG onset age significantly influencing DL prevalence. These findings highlight the need for personalized management strategies and evaluations (e.g., statins, LP(a) levels).

40572753,Prevalence and Fall Risk of Sarcopenia Based on the 2023 Korean Working Group on Sarcopenia Criteria.,"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Sarcopenia is a major risk factor for falls in older adults. The 2023 Korean Working Group on Sarcopenia (KWGS) introduced revised definitions, including functional sarcopenia, which considers low strength and performance despite normal muscle mass. This study investigated the prevalence of sarcopenia, severe sarcopenia, and functional sarcopenia using the KWGS criteria and their association with fall risk by sex and fall frequency. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from 2061 community-dwelling Korean adults aged 70-84 years who participated in the Korean Frailty and Aging cohort study. Sarcopenia was classified based on muscle mass, grip strength, and four physical performance tests. Fall experiences in the past year were categorized as ≥1, ≥2, and ≥4 falls. Logistic regression analyses were performed separately according to sex to evaluate the association between sarcopenia definition and fall risk. <i>Results</i>: The prevalence of sarcopenia and severe sarcopenia was 32.9% and 10.1% in men and 21.5% and 5.0% in women, respectively. Functional sarcopenia was more prevalent in women (10.5%) than in men (5.1%). In men, sarcopenia (defined using gait speed) was associated with fall risk across all thresholds (odds ratio [OR] = 2.28 for ≥1 fall; OR = 5.64 for ≥4 falls). In women, sarcopenia (defined using gait speed) was associated with ≥1 fall (OR = 1.72), while functional sarcopenia (defined using gait speed and timed up-and-go test) was associated with frequent falls (OR = 3.79-3.87). <i>Conclusions</i>: The 2023 KWGS guidelines revealed sex-specific differences in the prevalence of sarcopenia and highlighted gait speed as a key predictor of fall risk in men, whereas functional sarcopenia was more prevalent in women.

40572751,Evolving Treatment Strategies for Neuropathic Pain: A Narrative Review.,"Neuropathic pain resulting from injury to the somatosensory nervous system affects approximately 6.9-10% of the general population and significantly impacts quality of life. Common presentations include burning, stabbing, tingling, or electrical sensations, occurring spontaneously or through hyperalgesia or allodynia. Treatment approaches follow a tiered system. First-line therapies include gabapentinoids (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin), which target voltage-gated calcium channels; tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline, nortriptyline); and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as duloxetine. Second-line options encompass topical agents (e.g., 5% lidocaine, 8% capsaicin), opioid-like medications (e.g., tramadol, tapentadol), and adjunctive therapies including psychological therapies and lifestyle interventions. For refractory cases, third-line treatments include NMDA receptor antagonists (e.g., ketamine, dextromethorphan), cannabinoids, and botulinum toxin type A, though these have more limited clinical evidence. Procedural interventions such as spinal cord stimulation and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation provide alternatives when pharmacological approaches fail. Despite advances in treatment options, many patients remain undertreated, highlighting the need for individualized, multimodal approaches and continued research into the complex pathophysiology of neuropathic pain conditions.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2025.0,Alan D Kaye; Grace Armistead; Lane S Amedio; Mills E Manthei; Shahab Ahmadzadeh; Brian Bernhardt; Sahar Shekoohi,neuropathic pain result injury somatosensory nervous system affect approximately 6.9 10 general population significantly impact quality life common presentation include burn stab tingling electrical sensation occur spontaneously hyperalgesia allodynia treatment approach follow tiere system line therapy include gabapentinoid e.g. gabapentin pregabalin target voltage gate calcium channel tricyclic antidepressant e.g. amitriptyline nortriptyline serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor duloxetine second line option encompass topical agent e.g. 5 lidocaine 8 capsaicin opioid like medication e.g. tramadol tapentadol adjunctive therapy include psychological therapy lifestyle intervention refractory case line treatment include nmda receptor antagonist e.g. ketamine dextromethorphan cannabinoid botulinum toxin type limit clinical evidence procedural intervention spinal cord stimulation transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation provide alternative pharmacological approach fail despite advance treatment option patient remain undertreated highlight need individualized multimodal approach continue research complex pathophysiology neuropathic pain condition

The coexistence of FM complicates the evaluation of PsA disease activity and the planning of treatment strategies, as the two conditions share many overlapping clinical symptoms. To investigate the contribution of demographic factors and available serum biomarkers of inflammation and autoimmunity in characterizing the heterogeneity among patients meeting the classification criteria for both PsA and FM. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: This cross-sectional, single-center study involved 1547 adult patients evaluated between January 2017 and December 2024 who met the CASPAR criteria for PsA. A patient subgroup also met the 2016 ACR criteria for FM. Demographic data, serum inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and autoimmunity markers including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) were evaluated. Statistical analyses included chi-square tests, <i>t</i>-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and multivariate logistic regression to identify independent predictors associated with the coexistence of PsA and FM. <i>Results:</i> A total of 254 patients (16.42%) were diagnosed with concomitant FM. Compared to patients with PsA alone, those with concurrent PsA and FM showed significantly lower C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (0.39 ± 0.74 vs. 2.88 ± 12.31 mg/dL; <i>p</i> < 0.001) and a higher frequency of antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity (13.57% vs. 5.78%; <i>p</i> < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) positivity between the groups. Multivariate logistic regression identified female sex, ANA positivity, CRP levels ≤ 0.5 mg/dL, and elevated body mass index (BMI) as independent predictors of the presence of concomitant FM. <i>Conclusions</i>: Patients with concomitant PsA and FM have a distinct demographic and serological profile, suggesting the existence of a clinically significant subgroup within the PsA population.

This study aimed to assess the diagnostic performance of nutritional ultrasonography (NUS) in the morphofunctional evaluation of malnutrition and sarcopenia, and to compare its utility with established tools such as bioimpedance analysis (BIA), biochemical markers, handgrip strength (HGS), and functional performance tests. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> A cross-sectional study was conducted in 74 stable MHD patients. Clinical, analytical, anthropometric, BIA, NUS, and functional parameters were collected, along with validated nutritional and frailty scales. NUS was used to assess the quadriceps rectus femoris (QRF) and preperitoneal visceral fat (PPVF), measuring <i>Y</i>-axis, <i>Y</i>-axis/height, cross-sectional muscle area rectus femoris (CS-MARF), muscle area rectus femoris index adjusted to height (MARFI<sub>h</sub>), and supramuscular fat (SMF). Sarcopenia was defined according to the 2019 European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) criteria. <i>Results:</i> The prevalence of risk, confirmed, and severe sarcopenia was 24.3%, 40.5%, and 20.3%, respectively. Severe-to-moderate protein-energy wasting (PEW) affected 44.6% of patients. Compared to non-sarcopenic individuals, sarcopenic patients had lower values of HGS, prealbumin, lean body mass, and phase angle. NUS-derived cut-off values for sarcopenia were <i>Y</i>-axis ≤ 8 mm, <i>Y</i>-axis/height ≤ 2.9 mm/m<sup>2</sup>, CS-MARF ≤ 2.4 cm<sup>2</sup>, and MARFIh ≤ 0.9 cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>. The most discriminative NUS parameters were <i>Y</i>-axis and SMF (AUC 0.67), followed by <i>Y</i>-axis/height (AUC 0.65) and MARFI<sub>h</sub> (AUC 0.63). NUS measurements correlated significantly with ASMI, phase angle, HGS, and SPPB scores.

EVs inherit similar therapeutic effects, including the stimulation of tissue regeneration from the parental cells. The aim of our study was to isolate EVs produced by MSCs and use them to treat inner ear cells in culture to evaluate their protective potential against the damaging effect of an ototoxic drug. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: We isolated MSC-derived EVs by precipitation and characterized them by number, size, and morphology using nanoparticle tracking analysis and TEM, evaluated the protein concentration by BCA assay and the presence of EV markers CD9, CD63, and CD81 by the Dot Blot immunoblotting method. HEI-OC1 inner ear cell line was treated with EVs either alone or followed by Cisplatin. We assessed the uptake of EVs in HEI-OC1 cells by fluorescence microscopy after PKH26 labeling, ROS production by the DCFDA (dichlorfluorescein diacetate) assay, cellular viability by Alamar Blue assay, and apoptosis with the Annexin V/Propidium Iodide method. <i>Results</i>: The isolated EVs had mean dimensions of 184.4 nms and the concentration of the EV suspension was 180 × 10<sup>6</sup> particles/mL. TEM analysis showed intact vesicular structures with lipid-bilayer membranes having similar sizes with those measured by NTA. The PKH26-labeled EVs were observed in the HEI-OC1 cells after 24 h incubation, the amount increasing with the concentration. EVs reduced ROS production and increased the number of viable cells both alone and as pretreatment before Cisplatin, dose-dependently. Cells in early apoptosis were inhibited by EVs, while those in late apoptosis were enhanced, both with and without Cisplatin. <i>Conclusions</i>: EVs secreted by MSC protected HEI-OC1 cells against Cisplatin toxicity, reduced ROS production, and stimulated cell viability and the elimination of damaged cells by apoptosis, protecting the HEI-OC1 cells against Cisplatin-induced damage.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2025.0,Maria Perde-Schrepler; Ioana Brie; Mihai Cenariu; Sergiu Chira; Lajos Raduly; Liviuta Budisan; Ioana Berindan-Neagoe; Rares Stiufiuc; Maximilian Dindelegan; Cristina Blebea; Emoke Pall; Alma Aurelia Maniu,< > background objectives</i > extracellular vesicle ev derive mesenchymal stem cell gain attention potential therapeutic agent disease include hear disorder sensorineural hearing loss snhl evs inherit similar therapeutic effect include stimulation tissue regeneration parental cell aim study isolate evs produce msc use treat inner ear cell culture evaluate protective potential damaging effect ototoxic drug < > materials methods</i > isolate msc derive ev precipitation characterize number size morphology nanoparticle track analysis tem evaluate protein concentration bca assay presence ev marker cd9 cd63 cd81 dot blot immunoblotte method hei oc1 inner ear cell line treat evs follow cisplatin assess uptake evs hei oc1 cell fluorescence microscopy pkh26 label ros production dcfda dichlorfluorescein diacetate assay cellular viability alamar blue assay apoptosis annexin v propidium iodide method < > results</i > isolated evs mean dimension 184.4 nms concentration ev suspension 180 × 10 < sup>6</sup > particle ml. tem analysis show intact vesicular structure lipid bilayer membrane have similar size measure nta pkh26 label ev observe hei oc1 cell 24 h incubation increase concentration evs reduce ros production increase number viable cell pretreatment cisplatin dose dependently cell early apoptosis inhibit ev late apoptosis enhance cisplatin < > conclusions</i > evs secrete msc protect hei oc1 cell cisplatin toxicity reduce ros production stimulate cell viability elimination damage cell apoptosis protect hei oc1 cell cisplatin induce damage
40572726,Clinical Profiles and Medication Predictors in Early Childhood Psychiatric Referrals: A 10-Year Retrospective Study.,"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Although psychiatric disorders in early childhood are increasingly recognized, comprehensive clinical data from large samples in this age group remain limited. This study presents one of the largest and longest-term evaluations in Türkiye of children aged 0-72 months referred to child psychiatry. It aims to identify the most common presenting complaints, diagnostic patterns, and key predictors of psychotropic medication initiation in a previously understudied age group. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: This retrospective analysis included 3312 children aged 0-72 months who presented to the outpatient child psychiatry clinic of Trakya University Medical Faculty Hospital in Edirne, Türkiye. Clinical records were reviewed to extract data on presenting complaints, psychiatric diagnoses, psychotropic medication initiation, and demographic details, including age and sex. <i>Results</i>: The most common presenting complaints were ""delayed speech development"", ""irritability/frustration"", ""hyperactivity"", ""requests for medical reports"", and ""stuttering."" These complaints were more prevalent among children who received psychiatric diagnoses. Psychiatric diagnoses were more common in boys. Boys also presented at older ages and had longer follow-up durations. Psychotropic medications were initiated in 26.9% of the cases. The most frequently reported side effects were loss of appetite and drowsiness. Logistic regression analysis revealed that specific complaints were significantly predictive of initiating medication. These included ""inability to speak"", ""irritability/frustration"", ""hyperactivity"", ""lack of eye contact"", ""aggression"", ""school refusal"", ""sleep problems"", and ""fears."" <i>Conclusions</i>: This study revealed that some early childhood complaints, such as ""inability to speak"", ""restlessness"", ""hyperactivity"", and ""not making eye contact"", are strong predictors of both psychiatric diagnosis and initiation of psychotropic medication.

40572722,Magnetic Resonance Imaging Radiomics-Driven Artificial Neural Network Model for Advanced Glioma Grading Assessment.,"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Gliomas are characterized by high disability rates, frequent recurrence, and low survival rates, posing a significant threat to human health. Accurate grading of gliomas is crucial for treatment plan selection and prognostic assessment. Previous studies have primarily focused on the binary classification (i.e., high grade vs. low grade) of gliomas. In order to perform the four-grade (grades I, II, III, and IV) glioma classification preoperatively, we constructed an artificial neural network (ANN) model using magnetic resonance imaging data. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: We reviewed and included patients with gliomas who underwent preoperative MRI examinations. Radiomics features were derived from contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (CE-T<sub>1</sub>WI) using Pyradiomics and were selected based on their Spearman's rank correlation with glioma grades. We developed an ANN model to classify the four pathological grades of glioma, assigning training and validation sets at a 3:1 ratio. A diagnostic confusion matrix was employed to demonstrate the model's diagnostic performance intuitively. <i>Results</i>: Among the 362-patient cohort, the ANN model's diagnostic performance plateaued after incorporating the first 19 of the 530 extracted radiomic features. At this point, the average overall diagnostic accuracy ratings for the training and validation sets were 91.28% and 87.04%, respectively, with corresponding coefficients of variation (CVs) of 0.0190 and 0.0272. The diagnostic accuracies for grades I, II, III, and IV in the training set were 91.9%, 89.9%, 92.1%, and 90.7%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracies for grades I, II, III, and IV in the validation set were 88.7%, 87.1%, 86.5%, and 86.9%, respectively. <i>Conclusions</i>: The MRI radiomics-based ANN model shows promising potential for the four-type classification of glioma grading, offering an objective and noninvasive method for more refined glioma grading. This model could aid in clinical decision making regarding the treatment of patients with various grades of gliomas.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2025.0,Yan Qin; Wei You; Yulong Wang; Yu Zhang; Zhijie Xu; Qingling Li; Yuelong Zhao; Zhiwei Mou; Yitao Mao,< > background objectives</i > glioma characterize high disability rate frequent recurrence low survival rate pose significant threat human health accurate grading glioma crucial treatment plan selection prognostic assessment previous study primarily focus binary classification i.e. high grade vs. low grade glioma order perform grade grade ii iii iv glioma classification preoperatively construct artificial neural network ann model magnetic resonance imaging datum < > materials methods</i > review include patient glioma undergo preoperative mri examination radiomic feature derive contrast enhance t1 weighted image ce t < sub>1</sub > wi pyradiomics select base spearman rank correlation glioma grade develop ann model classify pathological grade glioma assign training validation set 3:1 ratio diagnostic confusion matrix employ demonstrate model diagnostic performance intuitively < > results</i > 362 patient cohort ann model diagnostic performance plateaue incorporate 19 530 extract radiomic feature point average overall diagnostic accuracy rating training validation set 91.28 87.04 respectively corresponding coefficient variation cv 0.0190 0.0272 diagnostic accuracy grade ii iii iv training set 91.9 89.9 92.1 90.7 respectively diagnostic accuracy grade ii iii iv validation set 88.7 87.1 86.5 86.9 respectively < > conclusions</i > mri radiomic base ann model show promise potential type classification glioma grading offer objective noninvasive method refine glioma grading model aid clinical decision making treatment patient grade glioma
40572719,Beyond the Classroom: The Role of Social Connections and Family in Adolescent Mental Health in the Transylvanian Population of Romania.,"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: This study explores gender variations in the associations between lifestyle choices, mental health, and social behaviors among adolescents in the Transylvania region of Romania. The analysis is based on data obtained through the Global School-Based Student Health Survey (GSHS). <i>Materials and Methods</i>: Data on 900 Romanian adolescents aged 11-18 years were obtained via the GSHS. This study evaluated nutritional statuses through BMI Z-scores, employing World Health Organization (WHO) cut-offs applied to self-reported height and weight; furthermore, it assessed well-being and perceived health; worries and sleep anxiety; social connections through having friends, loneliness, peer support, and emotional support; parental bonding relations; experiences of being bullied; safety and protection factors, including distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic and testing or vaccinations for COVID-19; and social behaviors, including the use of social networks. A multiple logistic regression was used to predict sleep disturbance anxiety, depending on sex, bullying, cyberbullying, loneliness, social network use, and peer support. <i>Results</i>: Results showed that the majority of the adolescents reported having one or more friends (96.8%), with no significant difference between girls and boys (<i>p</i> = 0.071). There were no statistically significant differences in bullying and cyberbullying experiences between sexes (<i>p</i> = 0.063). Notably, gender disparities exist in both health perceptions and risk behaviors, with girls experiencing higher rates of negative health perceptions, sleep anxiety (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and loneliness (<i>p</i> = 0.011) and boys exhibiting more overweight/obesity (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and school truancy (<i>p</i> = 0.027). According to the results, loneliness is significantly associated with a higher likelihood of sleep-disturbing anxiety (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Students who have experienced cyberbullying are more likely to also experience traditional bullying. Students who feel lonely are more likely to be victims of bullying. <i>Conclusions</i>: This study reveals significant gender disparities in adolescent health, particularly in mental health, risk behaviors, and social support. It highlights the need for gender-specific interventions to address these challenges and promote healthy development.

40572716,Validation of the Lithuanian Version of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group Rating Scale for Restless Legs Syndrome.,"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: According to the literature, Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) often remains underdiagnosed, with only a small proportion of individuals experiencing symptoms receiving an official diagnosis, highlighting the need for effective screening and diagnostic tools. The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group Rating Scale (IRLS) is a widely used tool for assessing the severity of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). However, a validated Lithuanian version has not yet been established. This study aimed to validate the Lithuanian version of the IRLS and assess its reliability, diagnostic performance, and correlation with clinical and demographic factors. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: This retrospective study included 136 patients who completed the Lithuanian version of the IRLS and underwent polysomnographic and clinical evaluations at the Department of Neurology of the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences between 2018 and 2024. A total of 134 patients were analyzed: 66 with clinically confirmed RLS and 68 controls without sleep disorders. Statistical analysis included the Mann-Whitney U test, chi-squared tests, Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, multivariate logistic regression, and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). <i>Results</i>: The Lithuanian IRLS demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 0.843 (95% CI: 0.782-0.904), with an optimal cut-off score of 7.50, resulting in high sensitivity (92.4%) and moderate specificity (66.2%). Multivariate regression identified higher IRLS scores (OR = 1.212, 95% CI: 1.084-1.356, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and a higher periodic limb movements of sleep arousal index (PLMSAI) (OR = 1.961, 95% CI: 1.036-3.712, <i>p</i> = 0.039) as significant independent predictors of RLS. After adjustments for age and sex, both IRLS scores and PLMSAI remained statistically significant predictors. <i>Conclusions</i>: the Lithuanian version of IRLS is a valid and reliable instrument for assessing RLS severity.

40572714,Cardiac Clues in Major Depressive Disorder: Evaluating Electrical Risk Score as a Predictive Electrocardiography Biomarker.,"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent psychiatric illness increasingly recognized as a systemic condition with implications for cardiovascular diseases. Growing evidence indicates that individuals with MDD have an elevated risk of cardiovascular mortality, underscoring the need for reliable, non-invasive biomarkers to assess cardiac risk. While underlying mechanisms remain unclear, electrocardiogram (ECG)-based markers offer a promising, non-invasive means of evaluation. Among these, the electrical risk score (ERS), a composite derived from specific ECG parameters, has emerged as a predictor of adverse cardiac outcomes. This study aimed to investigate the association between ERS and MDD, and whether ERS correlates with depression severity and illness duration. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, 12-lead ECGs were evaluated to calculate the ERS based on six ECG parameters: heart rate, corrected QT interval, Tp-e interval, frontal QRS-T angle, QRS transition zone, and presence of left ventricular hypertrophy according to Sokolow-Lyon criteria. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) was utilized. <i>Results</i>: The study included 102 patients with MDD and 62 healthy controls. No significant differences were observed in baseline or laboratory parameters between the groups. However, heart rate, Tp-e interval, frontal QRS-T angle, and ERS were significantly higher in the depression group. ROC analysis identified ERS as the strongest predictor of depression. ERS was significantly higher in patients with severe depression compared to those with mild symptoms and showed a positive correlation with both disease duration and HAM-D score. <i>Conclusions</i>: Here, we show that the ECG-derived ERS is significantly elevated in patients with MDD and is associated with increased cardiac risk. ERS outperformed conventional ECG parameters in identifying individuals with depression and demonstrated positive associations with both illness duration and symptom severity. These findings suggest that ERS may serve as a practical, non-invasive biomarker for assessing cardiovascular vulnerability in this population.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2025.0,Ulker Atilan Fedai; Halil Fedai; Zulkif Tanriverdi,< > background objectives</i > major depressive disorder mdd prevalent psychiatric illness increasingly recognize systemic condition implication cardiovascular disease grow evidence indicate individual mdd elevated risk cardiovascular mortality underscore need reliable non invasive biomarker assess cardiac risk underlying mechanism remain unclear electrocardiogram ecg)-based marker offer promising non invasive mean evaluation electrical risk score ers composite derive specific ecg parameter emerge predictor adverse cardiac outcome study aim investigate association ers mdd ers correlate depression severity illness duration < > materials methods</i > retrospective cross sectional study 12 lead ecg evaluate calculate ers base ecg parameter heart rate correct qt interval tp e interval frontal qrs t angle qrs transition zone presence left ventricular hypertrophy accord sokolow lyon criterion hamilton depression rating scale ham d utilize < > results</i > study include 102 patient mdd 62 healthy control significant difference observe baseline laboratory parameter group heart rate tp e interval frontal qrs t angle ers significantly high depression group roc analysis identify ers strong predictor depression ers significantly high patient severe depression compare mild symptom show positive correlation disease duration ham d score < > conclusions</i > ecg derive ers significantly elevate patient mdd associate increase cardiac risk ers outperform conventional ecg parameter identify individual depression demonstrate positive association illness duration symptom severity finding suggest ers serve practical non invasive biomarker assess cardiovascular vulnerability population
40572710,Remimazolam-Based Anesthesia and Systemic Inflammatory Biomarkers in Relation to Postoperative Delirium in Elderly Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication in elderly patients undergoing major surgery, associated with systemic inflammation and potentially influenced by anesthetic techniques. This study investigated whether remimazolam-based total intravenous anesthesia (R-TIVA) reduces the level of systemic inflammatory biomarkers and the incidence of POD more compared to inhalational anesthesia (IA) or balanced anesthesia (BA) in patients aged ≥ 65 years undergoing major non-neurosurgical, non-cardiac surgery. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: This retrospective cohort study analyzed the medical records of 340 patients categorized by anesthesia type: R-TIVA (<i>n</i> = 111), IA (<i>n</i> = 117), or BA (<i>n</i> = 112). Propensity score matching (PSM) created POD (<i>n</i> = 104) and No POD (<i>n</i> = 106) cohorts. Systemic inflammatory biomarkers-the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and C-reactive protein (CRP)-were measured pre- and postoperatively. POD was identified by clinical symptoms or the postoperative use of antipsychotics/sedatives. <i>Results</i>: The incidence of POD did not significantly differ among the R-TIVA, IA, and BA groups. However, the postoperative SII, NLR, PLR, and CRP levels were significantly lower in the R-TIVA group compared to those in the IA group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Both the preoperative (<i>r<sub>pb</sub></i> = 0.72, <i>p</i> < 0.01) and postoperative (<i>r<sub>pb</sub></i> = 0.58, <i>p</i> < 0.01) NLRs were strongly correlated with POD. Higher NLR values predicted the incidence of POD, with odds ratios of 1.71 for preoperative and 1.32 for postoperative measurements. <i>Conclusions</i>: While R-TIVA did not significantly reduce the incidence of POD compared to that of IA or BA, it was associated with reduced levels of postoperative inflammatory biomarkers. The preoperative and postoperative NLRs emerged as strong predictors of POD, suggesting their potential utility in guiding prophylactic strategies for older surgical patients. These findings underscore the interplay between anesthesia type, systemic inflammation, and delirium risk.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2025.0,Hayoung Lee; Keunyoung Kim; Cheol Lee,< > background objectives</i > postoperative delirium pod common complication elderly patient undergo major surgery associate systemic inflammation potentially influence anesthetic technique study investigate remimazolam base total intravenous anesthesia r tiva reduce level systemic inflammatory biomarker incidence pod compare inhalational anesthesia ia balanced anesthesia ba patient age ≥ 65 year undergo major non neurosurgical non cardiac surgery < > materials methods</i > retrospective cohort study analyze medical record 340 patient categorize anesthesia type r tiva < > n</i > = 111 ia < > n</i > = 117 ba < > n</i > = 112 propensity score matching psm create pod < > n</i > = 104 pod < > n</i > = 106 cohort systemic inflammatory biomarker systemic immune inflammation index sii neutrophil lymphocyte ratio nlr platelet lymphocyte ratio plr c reactive protein crp)-were measure pre- postoperatively pod identify clinical symptom postoperative use antipsychotic sedative < > results</i > incidence pod significantly differ r tiva ia ba group postoperative sii nlr plr crp level significantly low r tiva group compare ia group < > p</i > < 0.05 preoperative < > r < sub > pb</sub></i > = 0.72 < > p</i > < 0.01 postoperative < > r < sub > pb</sub></i > = 0.58 < > p</i > < 0.01 nlrs strongly correlate pod high nlr value predict incidence pod odd ratio 1.71 preoperative 1.32 postoperative measurement < > conclusions</i > r tiva significantly reduce incidence pod compare ia ba associate reduced level postoperative inflammatory biomarker preoperative postoperative nlrs emerge strong predictor pod suggest potential utility guide prophylactic strategy old surgical patient finding underscore interplay anesthesia type systemic inflammation delirium risk
40572704,Topical Nitroglycerin for Radial Access Optimization: Supporting Vascular Access in Patients at Risk for Acute Heart Failure.,"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Radial artery spasm (RAS) is a frequent complication during invasive angiography using the transradial approach, leading to patient discomfort and procedural challenges. While intra-arterial nitroglycerine (NTG) effectively reduces RAS after sheath insertion, preprocedural prevention strategies are limited. This study evaluates the efficacy of topical NTG in improving radial artery puncture success and reducing RAS incidence. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> In a randomized, double-blind single-center study 100 patients undergoing angiography were pretreated with either topical NTG or placebo. Outcomes assessed included RAS incidence, radial artery puncture success, number of attempts, procedural duration, patient discomfort, and complications. RAS was evaluated angiographically and clinically, with additional subgroup analyses for diabetic and smoking patients. <i>Results</i>: Topical NTG significantly reduced RAS incidence (53.2% vs. 73.6%; <i>p</i> = 0.0349) and increased radial puncture success on the first attempt (89.4% vs. 77.4%; <i>p</i> = 0.0488). Diabetic patients particularly benefited from NTG application, with lower RAS rates (36.4% vs. 76.2%; <i>p</i> = 0.0296).

40572695,Understanding of Stroke Risk Among Smokers in Saudi Arabia.,"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Stroke is a common and fatal condition impacting millions worldwide. Understanding the risk factors, symptoms, and consequences at an earlier stage, specifically in highly at-risk populations such as smokers, is crucial for mitigating the stroke burden. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Saudi Arabia on more than 1000 smokers. The survey was randomly shared across the kingdom. Multiple logistic regression models were applied to assess the association and find the variables associated with poor stroke awareness. <i>Results</i>: The study included 1029 smokers, with 88% (904) being male. The majority (61%; 630) are between the ages of 18 and 30 years, with a university degree (84%, 862). Cigarettes (33.9%; 349), shisha (25.9%; 267), and e-cigarettes (40.1%; 413) were the most common smoking types. About 30% of smokers have never heard of stroke, and 44% were unaware that stopping smoking can prevent stroke. Smokers (55%) perceive smoking as the top risk factor, followed by heart disease (41%), and high blood pressure (40.8%), while 26% of the smokers did not identify any risk factors. Around 58% of the smokers did not identify any stroke symptoms. Only 20% of smokers were capable of identifying 50% of both stroke risk factors and symptoms. Around 8% reported all stroke-related consequences, whereas 44% were unable to identify any. Current smokers were more likely than ex-smokers to identify ≥1 stroke risk factor (OR = 1.95, <i>p</i> = 0.001), with no significant associations found for other variables. Males, university degrees, and current smokers were the only significant predictors for the identification of ≥1 stroke symptom. University education, current smokers, employment, and smoking types were significant predictors in identifying ≥1 stroke consequence. Compared to E-cigarette users, cigarette smokers exhibited twice the awareness of stroke consequences (OR = 2.01, <i>p</i> = 0.001), whereas shisha smokers demonstrated lower awareness (OR = 0.63, <i>p</i> = 0.01). <i>Conclusions</i>: Smokers' awareness of stroke in Saudi Arabia is suboptimal. Targeted educational and smoking cessation initiatives are essential to address this gap and mitigate the impact of smoking-related strokes in Saudi Arabia.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2025.0,Jaber S Alqahtani; Abdulelah M Aldhahir; Abdullah A Alqarni; Saeed M Alghamdi; Tope Oyelade; Fahad Nawar Alzaidi; Muath Abdulrahman Alamri; Ali Mohammad Kheder; Hussain Ibrahim Alsamdani; Ayadh Yahya AlAyadi; Rayan A Siraj; Yousef S Aldabayan; Ahmed M Al Rajeh,< > background objectives</i > stroke common fatal condition impact million worldwide understand risk factor symptom consequence early stage specifically highly risk population smoker crucial mitigate stroke burden < > materials methods</i > cross sectional study conduct saudi arabia 1000 smoker survey randomly share kingdom multiple logistic regression model apply assess association find variable associate poor stroke awareness < > results</i > study include 1029 smoker 88 904 male majority 61 630 age 18 30 year university degree 84 862 cigarette 33.9 349 shisha 25.9 267 e cigarette 40.1 413 common smoking type 30 smoker hear stroke 44 unaware stop smoking prevent stroke smoker 55 perceive smoking risk factor follow heart disease 41 high blood pressure 40.8 26 smoker identify risk factor 58 smoker identify stroke symptom 20 smoker capable identify 50 stroke risk factor symptom 8 report stroke relate consequence 44 unable identify current smoker likely ex smoker identify ≥1 stroke risk factor = 1.95 < > p</i > = 0.001 significant association find variable male university degree current smoker significant predictor identification ≥1 stroke symptom university education current smoker employment smoking type significant predictor identify ≥1 stroke consequence compare e cigarette user cigarette smoker exhibit twice awareness stroke consequence = 2.01 < > p</i > = 0.001 shisha smoker demonstrate low awareness = 0.63 < > p</i > = 0.01 < > conclusions</i > smoker awareness stroke saudi arabia suboptimal target educational smoking cessation initiative essential address gap mitigate impact smoking relate stroke saudi arabia
40572691,Neuroimaging Insights into the Public Health Burden of Neuropsychiatric Disorders: A Systematic Review of Electroencephalography-Based Cognitive Biomarkers.,"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression, constitute a leading global public health challenge due to their high prevalence, chronicity, and profound cognitive and functional impact. This systematic review explores the role of electroencephalography (EEG)-based cognitive biomarkers in improving the understanding, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of these conditions. It evaluates how EEG-derived markers can reflect neuro-cognitive dysfunction and inform personalized and scalable mental health interventions. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. The databases searched included PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed empirical studies published between 2014 and 2025. Inclusion criteria focused on EEG-based investigations in clinical populations with neuropsychiatric diagnoses, emphasizing studies that assessed associations with cognitive function, symptom severity, treatment response, or functional outcomes. Of the 447 initially identified records, 132 studies were included in the final synthesis. <i>Results:</i> This review identifies several EEG markers-such as mismatch negativity (MMN), P300, frontal alpha asymmetry, and theta/beta ratios-as reliable indicators of cognitive impairments across psychiatric populations. These biomarkers are associated with deficits in attention, memory, and executive functioning, and show predictive utility for treatment outcomes and disease progression. Methodological trends indicate an increasing use of machine learning and multimodal neuroimaging integration to enhance diagnostic specificity. While many studies exhibit moderate risk of bias, the overall findings support EEG biomarkers' reproducibility and translational relevance. <i>Conclusions</i>: EEG-based cognitive biomarkers offer a valuable, non-invasive means of capturing the neurobiological underpinnings of psychiatric disorders. Their diagnostic and prognostic potential, as well as high temporal resolution and portability, supports their use in clinical and public health contexts. The field, however, requires further standardization, cross-validation, and investment in scalable applications.

40572688,Factors Affecting Sleep and Wakefulness in People with Epilepsy: A Narrative Review.,"The importance of sleep has been reported for decades. Epilepsy is a heterogeneous disorder comprising multiple elements that might influence sleep and wakefulness. Notably, animal studies show disruptions of the circadian molecular system in different models of epilepsy, along with altered rest-activity and other circadian rhythms. So far, studies of molecular circadian systems in people with epilepsy are lacking, prompting further research. Seizures-the primary and most debilitating symptom of epilepsy-and interictal activity disrupt regular sleep and sleep-wake rhythms. Alterations in one's sleep structure are seen in both drug-naïve and drug-resistant patients with epilepsy. In particular, low sleep efficiency, a reduction in total sleep time, and changes in sleep stages were found in both homogenous and mixed samples of epilepsy patients. Both ictal and interictal activity were also shown to be associated with changes in peripheral circadian phase biomarkers such as melatonin and cortisol. Moreover, epilepsy comorbidities, antiseizure medications, and a variety of syndromes can be a cause of sleep problems or even sleep disorders. Sleep disorders vary depending on various comorbidities and syndromes, and encompass all major groups of sleep disorders defined in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders. Controversial findings on the effects of various antiseizure medications were found in the literature. However, medications such as benzodiazepines, gabapentinoids, and barbiturates are particularly associated with excessive daytime sleepiness. Overall, a sleep evaluation must be included in the management of every patient with epilepsy.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2025.0,Dovydas Burkojus; Giedrė Gelžinienė; Evelina Pajėdienė; Gineta Stankevičienė; Valdonė Misevičienė; Giedrė Jurkevičienė,importance sleep report decade epilepsy heterogeneous disorder comprise multiple element influence sleep wakefulness notably animal study disruption circadian molecular system different model epilepsy altered rest activity circadian rhythm far study molecular circadian system people epilepsy lack prompt research seizure primary debilitate symptom epilepsy interictal activity disrupt regular sleep sleep wake rhythm alteration sleep structure see drug naïve drug resistant patient epilepsy particular low sleep efficiency reduction total sleep time change sleep stage find homogenous mixed sample epilepsy patient ictal interictal activity show associate change peripheral circadian phase biomarker melatonin cortisol epilepsy comorbiditie antiseizure medication variety syndrome cause sleep problem sleep disorder sleep disorder vary depend comorbiditie syndrome encompass major group sleep disorder define international classification sleep disorders controversial finding effect antiseizure medication find literature medication benzodiazepine gabapentinoid barbiturate particularly associate excessive daytime sleepiness overall sleep evaluation include management patient epilepsy

After inclusion and exclusion criteria, 583 patients were included. Based on 90-day mRS scores, patients were classified into two groups: good (mRS ≤ 2, <i>n</i> = 257) and poor functional outcomes (mRS 3-6, <i>n</i> = 326). The pre-stroke scores were calculated. <i>Results</i>: When ROC curve analysis was performed, R<sub>2</sub>CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA demonstrated the highest AUC value (<i>p</i> = 0.0443) among these scores. The optimal cutoff score was determined to be 4, yielding a sensitivity of 75.77% and specificity of 93.39%.

40572657,An Investigation into the Effects of Frailty and Sarcopenia on Postoperative Anesthesia Recovery and Complications Among Geriatric Patients Undergoing Colorectal Malignancy Surgery.,"<i>Backgrounds and Objectives:</i> In this study, we aimed to assess preoperative frailty among hospitalized patients over 60 undergoing colorectal cancer surgery. We investigated the impacts of frailty and sarcopenia on postoperative recovery, complications, and discharge time, while also identifying a cost-effective, bedside-accessible USG parameter for diagnosing sarcopenia among patients assessed using the ""Sonographic Thigh Adjustment Ratio"" method. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> In this prospective study, we investigated the impacts of frailty and sarcopenia on the postoperative outcomes of 42 geriatric patients (with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores of I-III) undergoing colorectal cancer surgery under general anesthesia. Frailty was assessed using the FRAIL scale, and sarcopenia was evaluated using the STAR (sonographic thigh adjustment ratio). Ultrasonographic measurements of rectus femoris and vastus intermedius muscle thicknesses were taken, and thigh lengths (TLs) were recorded. Ratios, including rectus femoris thickness/TL (RFT/TL), vastus intermedius thickness/TL (VIT/TL), and total muscle thickness/TL (TMT/TL), were calculated. Postoperative anesthesia recovery was monitored using the Modified Aldrete Score, indicating the time until discharge from the recovery unit. Complications were classified using the Clavien-Dindo system, and hospital discharge times were noted. <i>Results:</i> We observed significant differences between frailty status and ASA scores, as well as between age and frailty status. Muscle thickness significantly differed between the frail and pre-frail patients. Among the sarcopenic patients, age differences were significant. In men, VIT/TL was significantly correlated with sarcopenia diagnosis, whereas, in women, RFT/TL, VIT/TL, and TMT/TL were all correlated with sarcopenia. <i>Conclusions:</i> Based on our results, we conclude that VIT/TL measurement can serve as a predictive marker for preoperative sarcopenia, optimizing patient health before surgery.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2025.0,Rüştü Özdemir; Ferda Yaman,< > backgrounds objectives:</i > study aim assess preoperative frailty hospitalize patient 60 undergo colorectal cancer surgery investigate impact frailty sarcopenia postoperative recovery complication discharge time identify cost effective bedside accessible usg parameter diagnose sarcopenia patient assess sonographic thigh adjustment ratio method < > materials methods:</i > prospective study investigate impact frailty sarcopenia postoperative outcome 42 geriatric patient american society anesthesiologists asa score iii undergo colorectal cancer surgery general anesthesia frailty assess frail scale sarcopenia evaluate star sonographic thigh adjustment ratio ultrasonographic measurement rectus femoris vastus intermedius muscle thickness take thigh length tl record ratio include rectus femoris thickness tl rft tl vastus intermedius thickness tl vit tl total muscle thickness tl tmt tl calculate postoperative anesthesia recovery monitor modified aldrete score indicate time discharge recovery unit complication classify clavien dindo system hospital discharge time note < > results:</i > observe significant difference frailty status asa score age frailty status muscle thickness significantly differed frail pre frail patient sarcopenic patient age difference significant man vit tl significantly correlate sarcopenia diagnosis woman rft tl vit tl tmt tl correlate sarcopenia < > conclusions:</i > base result conclude vit tl measurement serve predictive marker preoperative sarcopenia optimize patient health surgery
40572654,Dance and Somatic-Informed Movement in an Acute Inpatient Stroke Unit.,"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Stroke units rely on interdisciplinary teams. Professionals with complementary alternative practices may join the team since such approaches are increasingly supporting the stroke recovery process. The aim of this study was to develop a better understanding of how a dance and somatic-informed movement intervention could be utilized in an inpatient setting as an adjunct to post-stroke therapy. We sought to identify (1) what knowledge we could draw on to develop the content and pedagogy for the intervention, (2) what helped/hindered the intervention aimed at functional recovery, as perceived by the practitioner-researchers, and (3) the relationships experienced with the various stakeholders. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> This exploratory qualitative study used the enhanced critical incident technique to collect retrospective self-report data from two practitioner-researchers engaged in delivering the intervention over two months. The data underwent thematic analysis. Patients (n = 6) in a stroke unit were selected within ≤72 h of hospital admission. The intervention was conducted four to six times a week until the vascular neurologist (co-researcher) authorized their transfer to a rehabilitation hospital. <i>Results</i>: The intervention evolved from crafting content and pedagogy at the intersection of different areas of knowledge (dance, somatics, neuroscience, and stroke). It was based on active, assisted, and passive movements. Verbal, tactile, visual, and imaginary inputs used to enhance body awareness were perceived as potentially helping patients recover some range of motion, quality of movements, and voluntary movement control, and fostering calmness and motivation. The intervention was well received by stakeholders. <i>Conclusions</i>: Dance and somatic-informed movement can be a complementary therapy in stroke units, although it requires a delicate juggling of time allocation within the interdisciplinary team.

40572619,Brain Neurotrophins and Plant Polyphenols: A Powerful Connection.,"Neurodegenerative disorders, mental conditions, and cognitive decline represent significant challenges worldwide, with growing pieces of evidence implicating alterations in neurotrophin signaling as central to these diseases. Neurotrophins-such as nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-are indispensable for neuronal survival, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity, and their dysregulation is closely associated with various neuropathological situations. Similarly, dietary plant polyphenols, abundant in vegetables, fruits, wine, tea, and extra virgin olive oil, show powerful anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic activities. This narrative review critically addresses the evolving body of evidence that links plant polyphenols and brain neurotrophins, emphasizing several molecular mechanisms by which polyphenols regulate and modulate neurotrophin signaling. Crucial pathways include mitigation of neuroinflammatory responses, activation of intracellular cascades such as the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), epigenetic modulation, and the diminution of oxidative stress. Together, these effects contribute to potentiated enhanced synaptic function, neuronal integrity, and better learning and memory processes. Moreover, this narrative review examines how polyphenol-induced upregulation of neurotrophins may alleviate conditions associated not only with neurodegeneration but also with addiction and mood disorders, suggesting extensive therapeutic approaches. Findings from clinical investigations and animal models are presented to sustain the neuroprotective role of polyphenol-rich diets.

40572615,"Anti-Anxiety Effects of Essential Oil Microemulsion in Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress-Induced Rats: Preparation, Characterization, and Mechanisms.","Anxiety disorders, as common neurological diseases in clinical practice, often coexist with depression. Epidemiological surveys indicate that approximately 85% of patients with depression exhibit significant anxiety symptoms. This comorbid state not only exacerbates clinical symptoms but also leads to treatment resistance and prolonged disease duration. This study innovatively developed a compound aromatic plant essential oil (EO) formulation with remarkable anxiolytic and antidepressant effects and systematically elucidated its mechanism of action. The study found that the essential oil formulation, administered via inhalation, could significantly improve behavioral abnormalities in animals subjected to the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model, specifically manifesting as (1) the reversal of stress-induced weight gain retardation; (2) a significant increase in sucrose preference; (3) an increase in the total distance of spontaneous activity; and (4) the prolongation of exploration time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze. Neuropathological examinations confirmed that the formulation could effectively protect the structural integrity of hippocampal neurons and alleviate CUMS-induced neural damage. In terms of mechanism of action, the study revealed that the formulation regulates the neurotransmitter system through multiple targets: (1) the upregulation of serotonin (5-HT) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels; (2) the downregulation of glutamate (GLU) concentration; and (3) key targets identified via network pharmacological analysis, such as ESR1, STAT3, and PPARG. These findings provide molecular-level evidence for understanding the neuromodulatory effects of aromatic essential oils. Pharmaceutical formulation studies showed that the oil-in-water (O/W) type compound essential oil microemulsion, prepared using microemulsification technology, has a uniform particle size and excellent stability, maintaining stable physicochemical properties at room temperature for an extended period, thus laying a foundation for its clinical application. This study not only validates the practical value of traditional medicine but also provides new ideas for the development of novel anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs, achieving an organic integration of traditional experience and modern technology.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2025.0,Wenxia Tang; Pan Jiang; Ke Hu; Duo Mei; Qinghao Jiao; Yan Li; Yanping Deng; Jun Wang; Ran Gao; Xin Chen; Jie Yu,anxiety disorder common neurological disease clinical practice coexist depression epidemiological survey indicate approximately 85 patient depression exhibit significant anxiety symptom comorbid state exacerbate clinical symptom lead treatment resistance prolonged disease duration study innovatively develop compound aromatic plant essential oil eo formulation remarkable anxiolytic antidepressant effect systematically elucidate mechanism action study find essential oil formulation administer inhalation significantly improve behavioral abnormality animal subject chronic unpredictable mild stress cums model specifically manifest 1 reversal stress induce weight gain retardation 2 significant increase sucrose preference 3 increase total distance spontaneous activity 4 prolongation exploration time open arm elevated plus maze neuropathological examination confirm formulation effectively protect structural integrity hippocampal neuron alleviate cums induce neural damage term mechanism action study reveal formulation regulate neurotransmitter system multiple target 1 upregulation serotonin 5 ht γ aminobutyric acid gaba level 2 downregulation glutamate glu concentration 3 key target identify network pharmacological analysis esr1 stat3 pparg finding provide molecular level evidence understand neuromodulatory effect aromatic essential oil pharmaceutical formulation study show oil water o w type compound essential oil microemulsion prepare microemulsification technology uniform particle size excellent stability maintain stable physicochemical property room temperature extended period lay foundation clinical application study validate practical value traditional medicine provide new idea development novel anxiolytic antidepressant drug achieve organic integration traditional experience modern technology

A 77-year-old male, with bladder cancer previously treated with BCG instillation, presented with fever, confusion, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) consistent with encephalitis one month after the last BCG instillation. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed marked hypoglycorrhachia, hyperproteinorrachia, and lymphocytic pleocytosis. Despite CSF culture negativity, the presentation was considered suggestive of BCG-related encephalitis, and the empirical standard antitubercular treatment (rifampin, isoniazid and ethambutol), plus dexamethasone, was initiated. Following initial improvement, gait ataxia and hemiplegia were observed at the 4-month follow-up. MRI revealed an excluded enlarged left lateral ventricle with signs of ventriculitis, requiring surgical drainage. CSF collected during neurosurgery resulted positive on PCR for <i>M. tuberculosis</i> complex. Adjunctive linezolid was initiated, replaced by levofloxacin due to adverse events after 2 weeks. The patient was discharged following a normal CSF analysis. Oral antitubercular therapy was prescribed for 14 months and there were no signs of relapse at the 24-month follow-up.

40572055,Subjective cognitive decline among diverse older adults: Prevalence and associations with objective cognition.,"Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may precede objective cognitive impairment. We examined prevalence, type of SCD, and associations with neuropsychological measures among diverse older adults. The sample included older adults from three ethnoracial groups enrolled in the U.S. Study to Protect Brain Health Through Lifestyle Intervention to Reduce Risk (POINTER) trial. Everyday Cognition (ECog) measured SCD, and neuropsychological function was assessed using global memory, executive function, and processing speed composites. Hispanic/Latinx participants were more likely to report SCD than non-Hispanic White (NHW) or Black participants, particularly executive function concerns. In the full sample, adjusting for demographics and depression, SCD ratings were associated with most neuropsychological outcomes.

40572043,Synbiotics of Lactobacillus suilingensis and inulin alleviates cognitive impairment via regulating gut microbiota indole-3-lactic acid metabolism in female AD mice.,"Recent studies have found that gut microbial tryptophan metabolism is altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. However, the functional consequences of these changes and their therapeutic potential remain unclear. The metagenomic data of 49 preclinical AD patients and 115 healthy controls were analyzed. A synbiotic with targeted metabolic functions was formulated based on in vitro testing, and its effect on AD was evaluated using female 5×FAD mice. Indole lactic acid (ILA) synthesis was downregulated in AD patients. Synbiotic treatment combining Lactobacillus suilingensis and inulin outperformed probiotic treatment alone in enhancing tryptophan metabolism, and increasing ILA biosynthesis. Increased ILA could reduce Aβ accumulation and significantly alleviate cognitive impairment in female AD mice by inhibiting neuroinflammation through activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling pathway. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting gut microbial tryptophan metabolism in AD and provides a rationale for future precision strategies aimed at modulating microbiota-derived metabolic pathways.

40572015,Hyperbaric Oxygen Attenuates Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury in Rats by Modulating Sodium Channels.,"Ischemic stroke accounts for the majority of stroke cases. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is being increasingly used as a treatment for this condition, but its precise mechanisms of action remain incompletely elucidated. This study examined hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) effects on sodium channels in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in rats with cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). Using the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model and whole-cell patch-clamp technology, voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) currents were measured at varying HBOT time points and treatment durations. Results showed that with a longer CIRI duration, the maximum current density (MCD) of sodium current (INa) decreased, while more HBOT sessions increased the MCD of INa. Notably, in the MCAO 6H group, 12 treatments of HBOT induced a leftward shift in the INa activation curve. Early HBOT intervention provided greater neuroprotection for sodium channels, and increased treatment sessions enhanced functional recovery. These findings suggest HBO's therapeutic potential in mitigating CIRI-related neuronal damage.",Developmental neurobiology,2025.0,Binli Gao; Mei Peng; Fulan Chen; Xiaoling Peng; Ke Huang; Qiang Li; Yuee Dai; Xianrong Zeng,ischemic stroke account majority stroke case hyperbaric oxygen therapy hbot increasingly treatment condition precise mechanism action remain incompletely elucidated study examine hyperbaric oxygen hbo effect sodium channel hippocampal ca1 pyramidal neuron rat cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury ciri middle cerebral artery occlusion mcao model cell patch clamp technology voltage gate sodium channel vgsc current measure vary hbot time point treatment duration result show long ciri duration maximum current density mcd sodium current ina decrease hbot session increase mcd ina notably mcao 6h group 12 treatment hbot induce leftward shift ina activation curve early hbot intervention provide great neuroprotection sodium channel increase treatment session enhance functional recovery finding suggest hbo therapeutic potential mitigate ciri relate neuronal damage
40571980,Stability and change of psychopathology symptoms among youth with chronic physical illness: A latent transition analysis.,"BackgroundThis study examined whether youth transition between different mental health symptom profiles over time, and what factors predict these transitions. Understanding the stability and change in psychopathology helps discern whether certain behaviours are temporary or signs of persistent problems.MethodsData were drawn from a longitudinal study of 263 youth (ages 2-16) with chronic physical illness and their parents, assessed at baseline (T1), six months (T2), 12 months (T3), and 24 months (T4). Parents reported on youth psychopathology using the Emotional Behavioural Scales (EBS). Latent profile analysis identified psychopathology profiles, and latent transition analysis quantified the probability that youth remained or moved between groups over time.ResultsFour profiles were identified: low psychopathology (LP), primarily internalizing (PI), primarily externalizing (PE), and high psychopathology (HP). Homotypic continuity (i.e., remaining in the same profile over time) was lower for the PI, PE, and HP subgroups. Youth in the PI subgroup were more likely to transition to the LP, while those in HP showed greater stability, with many remaining in the high-symptom groups. Child age, parent psychopathology, and parent education significantly predicted profile transitions.ConclusionsMost youth showed changes in their mental health over time, but a small proportion with HP (<5%) had more persistent problems.

40571949,Sex-differences in autonomic and cardiovascular responses to multimodal therapy in Parkinson's disease: a pilot study.,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) bears a variety of sex differences and is associated with cardiovascular dysregulation (CDR). Variation in the routinely assessed standard parameters heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) seem not well understood within the frame of sex-specific developments under therapy. Parameters of heart rate variability (RMSSD) and electrodermal activity (meanEDA) may assist the understanding of underlying autonomic developments. This pilot study aims to describe sex-specific cardiovascular and autonomic responses to a multimodal inpatient rehabilitation program in patients with PD. Forty-one PD patients (24 male, 17 female) participated in a stationary, multimodal therapy intervention (MTI). Before and after MTI, HR, BP, RMSSD, and meanEDA were assessed in supine baseline (5 min of rest before orthostasis) and during supine adaption to rest (5 min of rest after orthostasis). Differences between baseline and adaption to rest as well as differences over time of MTI were calculated using Wilcoxon test; sex differences using Mann-Whitney-U test. Before MTI, women's supine HR (p = .034*; d = .17) and BP (p = .015*, d = 0.4) were significantly higher during adaption to rest than during baseline. After MTI, women's supine HR (p = .020*; d = .84) and BP (p = .022*, d = 0.5) during adaption to rest had decreased significantly. Men's HR and BP remained constant and without differences between the supine conditions. RMSSD and meanEDA remained steady in both sexes. The sex-specific responsiveness to MTI supports the concept of sex-sensitive therapeutic management for cardiovascular symptoms in PD. In both sexes, peripheral cardiovascular outcomes appeared not attributable to corresponding outcomes in autonomic regulation. Further examination of autonomic parameters could provide a foundation for developing therapeutic approaches that address central nervous system mechanisms.

This review explores the latest neuromodulation techniques, focusing on the critical role of γ oscillations in various brain disorders. Direct γ neuromodulation induces γ-frequency oscillations to synchronize disrupted brain networks, while indirect methods influence γ oscillations by modulating cortical excitability. We investigate how monitoring dynamic features of γ oscillations allows for detailed evaluations of neuromodulation effectiveness. By targeting γ oscillatory patterns and restoring healthy cross-frequency coupling, interventions may alleviate cognitive and behavioral symptoms linked to disrupted communication. This review examines clinical applications of γ neuromodulations, including enhancing cognitive function through 40 Hz multisensory stimulation in Alzheimer's disease, improving motor function in Parkinson's disease, controlling seizures in epilepsy, and modulating emotional dysfunctions in depression. Additionally, these neuromodulation strategies aim to regulate excitatory-inhibitory imbalances and restore γ synchrony across neurological and psychiatric disorders. The review highlights the potential of γ oscillations as biomarkers to boost restorative results in clinical applications of neuromodulation.

This study assessed costs and cost-associated factors in patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) dementia compared to healthy controls. The German DELCODE cohort study assessed clinical data, healthcare resource use, and informal care provision. Costs were calculated from payer and societal perspectives using standardized unit costs, and multivariate regression analyses identified cost-associated factors. From a payer perspective, costs were elevated by 26% for SCD (adjusted mean 5,976€ [95%CI 4,598-7,355€]), 85% for MCI (8,795€ [6,200-11,391€]) and 36% for AD (6,454€ [2,796-10,111€]) compared to controls (4,754€ [3,586-5,922€]).

40571926,Point of care ultrasound assessment of the optic nerve sheath diameter in critically ill children.,"Raised intracranial pressure (ICP) is a typical neurological problem in critically ill children, which is associated with poor clinical outcomes or even death. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) as a point-of-care testing in the pediatric intensive care units for early diagnosis of raised intracranial pressure and as a follow up tool for treatment response. A prospective observational study was conducted in the pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care children's hospital. Consecutive children aged one month to twelve years with Glasgow Coma Scale less than or equal to 8 were included. Brain CT was performed just before or within few hours of admission to identify raised ICP. Two trained examiners in the same work place, who were blinded to the clinical details of the patients, performed the ONSD sonography concurrently. The ONSD was measured in the left and right eyes on admission, after 1 h, after 12 h, and after 24 h. Forty-two patients were categorized into 29 children with raised ICP and 13 children with non-raised ICP. The ONSD was significantly higher in the raised ICP group at all times in both eyes.

40571876,Deficient Astrocyte Homeostatic Support Contributes to Brain Impairment in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.,"In addition to their muscle functions, dystrophins -the protein products of the DMD gene - also play a role in the central nervous system (CNS). In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the progressive muscle degeneration, is associated with cognitive and behavioural impairments, which are severe in one-third of patients and substantially increase the overall clinical burden. The mechanisms of these neuropsychiatric abnormalities are complex and only partially understood. Specific dystrophins are functionally important in various brain cells and at their specialisations, with further diversity occurring throughout brain development and maturation across brain regions. Mutations affecting the full-length dystrophins (Dp427) cause the disease, while the additional loss of shorter isoforms (Dp140 and Dp71) can exacerbate the clinical presentation. Truncated dystrophins are strongly expressed in the healthy brain and therefore were investigated extensively, but most of DMD patients presenting with neuropsychiatric abnormalities do not have mutations affecting these isoforms. When the full-length dystrophins are considered, the abnormalities unquestionably involve not only neurones but also astrocytes, where absence of dystrophins reduces proliferation, disrupts neurotransmitter regulation, synaptic stability, and neurovascular integrity. Deficiency of astrocytic dystrophins impairs glutamate clearance, leading to excitotoxicity and neuronal hyperexcitability linked to multiple neuropsychiatric manifestations. This review evaluates evidence on dystrophin's role in astrocytes, its contribution to synaptic malfunction, and parallels with other neurodevelopmental disorders. Understanding that the deficient astrocyte homeostasis contributes to DMD can lead to the exploration of novel therapeutic strategies involving astrocyte-mediated neurotransmitter regulation to mitigate neuropsychiatric deficits.",Neurochemical research,2025.0,Dariusz C Gorecki; Abdulsamie M Patel; Joanna Pomeroy; Alexei Verkhratsky,addition muscle function dystrophin -the protein product dmd gene play role central nervous system cns duchenne muscular dystrophy dmd progressive muscle degeneration associate cognitive behavioural impairment severe patient substantially increase overall clinical burden mechanism neuropsychiatric abnormality complex partially understand specific dystrophin functionally important brain cell specialisation diversity occur brain development maturation brain region mutation affect length dystrophin dp427 cause disease additional loss short isoform dp140 dp71 exacerbate clinical presentation truncated dystrophin strongly express healthy brain investigate extensively dmd patient present neuropsychiatric abnormality mutation affect isoform length dystrophin consider abnormality unquestionably involve neurone astrocyte absence dystrophin reduce proliferation disrupt neurotransmitter regulation synaptic stability neurovascular integrity deficiency astrocytic dystrophin impairs glutamate clearance lead excitotoxicity neuronal hyperexcitability link multiple neuropsychiatric manifestation review evaluate evidence dystrophin role astrocyte contribution synaptic malfunction parallel neurodevelopmental disorder understand deficient astrocyte homeostasis contribute dmd lead exploration novel therapeutic strategy involve astrocyte mediate neurotransmitter regulation mitigate neuropsychiatric deficit
40571875,Prevalence and Characteristics of Hoarding Behaviour and Domestic Squalor Among Adults With Mild Intellectual Disability Receiving Residential or Outpatient Care.,"To date, no studies have examined the prevalence of hoarding behaviour and domestic squalor among individuals with mild intellectual disability. To address this gap, we conducted a prevalence study within a population supported by a medium-sized care organisation in the Netherlands. Data were collected on 437 individuals with mild intellectual disability receiving care in residential facilities or through outpatient services. Assessments were conducted using the Hoarding Rating Scale-Interview, the Environmental Cleanliness and Clutter Scale, and the Clutter Image Rating Scale. Hoarding behaviour and/or domestic squalor were observed in 16.8% of the residents. Support staff identified 8.3% of dwellings as posing significant safety risks or health hazards. Additionally, 6.7% of residents had been threatened with eviction due to hoarding or squalor.

40571861,Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome and GAD65 related-temporal lobe epilepsy.,"Autoimmune polyglandular syndromes (APS) encompass a broad spectrum of disorders. APS III is characterized by autoimmune thyroiditis (AT) plus any autoimmune disorder, excluding Addison's disease. This study explores the link between GAD65 related-temporal lobe epilepsy (GAD-TLE) and APS III. We retrospectively analyzed 29 GAD-TLE patients. Eighteen patients (62%) experienced at least one autoimmune disease, and ten patients (56%) fulfilled diagnostic criteria for APS III. In addition to AT and GAD-TLE, five patients had type 1 diabetes mellitus, one patient had latent autoimmune diabetes in adulthood, one autoimmune alopecia, one pernicious anemia, one had celiac disease and one patient had autoimmune alopecia, vitiligo, autoimmune atrophic gastritis and psoriasis. Approximately 35 years after the onset of the first disease, the probability of having the second disorder is over 80%. In our cohort, GAD65 antibodies are more frequently linked to AT than to type 1 diabetes mellitus, despite their well-known association. Our data suggests that GAD65-TLE may share a common pathophysiology and should be included among APS-III diagnostic criteria. These insights support the need for rigorous, multidisciplinary monitoring to prevent delays in diagnosis and treatment.

40571858,Caveolin-1-Mediated Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption via MMP2/9 Contributes to Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction.,"Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a prevalent complication following major surgery, particularly in older adults, and is associated with increased morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, and reduced quality of life. Although blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption has been implicated in POCD pathogenesis, the molecular mechanisms remain poorly defined. In this study, we identify Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a membrane scaffolding protein highly expressed in endothelial cells (ECs), as a key regulator of BBB integrity and cognitive function following surgical trauma. Using a tibial fracture internal fixation model in mice, we observed a significant upregulation of Cav-1 in the hippocampus, accompanied by reduced expression of tight junctions (TJs) proteins (Claudin-5 and ZO-1), increased BBB permeability, and impaired performance in behavioral assays indicative of cognitive decline. Pharmacological inhibition of Cav-1 via methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) attenuated these effects, restoring TJs expression, reducing BBB leakage, and improving cognitive outcomes. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we employed an in vitro inflammation model using LPS-stimulated brain microvascular ECs. Cav-1 upregulation was found to increase the expression of matrix metalloproteinases MMP2 and MMP9, which in turn degraded TJs. Inhibition of Cav-1 suppressed MMP2/9 expression and preserved barrier integrity, confirming a Cav-1/MMP2/9 signaling axis. These findings demonstrate that Cav-1 plays a central role in mediating BBB breakdown and postoperative cognitive impairment via MMP-dependent degradation of TJs. Targeting Cav-1 may offer a novel therapeutic strategy to preserve BBB function and reduce the incidence of POCD in surgical patients.",Neurochemical research,2025.0,Xinrui Li; Weihua Ding; Xia Zhang; Xiaodong Tang; Yueying Zheng; Yi Ma; Xiuxia Bao; Xianhui Kang; Shengmei Zhu,postoperative cognitive dysfunction pocd prevalent complication follow major surgery particularly old adult associate increase morbidity prolonged hospitalization reduce quality life blood brain barrier bbb disruption implicate pocd pathogenesis molecular mechanism remain poorly define study identify caveolin-1 cav-1 membrane scaffold protein highly express endothelial cell ecs key regulator bbb integrity cognitive function follow surgical trauma tibial fracture internal fixation model mouse observe significant upregulation cav-1 hippocampus accompany reduced expression tight junction tj protein claudin-5 zo-1 increase bbb permeability impair performance behavioral assay indicative cognitive decline pharmacological inhibition cav-1 methyl β cyclodextrin mβcd attenuate effect restore tj expression reduce bbb leakage improve cognitive outcome elucidate underlying mechanism employ vitro inflammation model lps stimulate brain microvascular ecs cav-1 upregulation find increase expression matrix metalloproteinase mmp2 mmp9 turn degrade tj inhibition cav-1 suppress mmp2/9 expression preserve barrier integrity confirm cav-1 mmp2/9 signal axis finding demonstrate cav-1 play central role mediate bbb breakdown postoperative cognitive impairment mmp dependent degradation tj target cav-1 offer novel therapeutic strategy preserve bbb function reduce incidence pocd surgical patient

Reliable preclinical models for sporadic AD are lacking. The intracerebroventricular (ICV) streptozotocin (STZ) model simulates pathology of sporadic AD; its timeline remains ambiguous. We assessed multiple endpoints in male Wistar rats 1 and 3 months post-ICV STZ (3 mg/kg; n = 72; control, sham, STZ). Spatial and associative memory was tested via the Morris Water Maze and Passive Avoidance Task. Hippocampal superoxide dismutase (SOD), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were measured by ELISA; neuronal integrity and amyloid deposits by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and Congo red staining. STZ groups (3-months vs. 1-month) exhibited cognitive deficits: increased escape latency (80.14 ± 5.75 vs. 65.68 ± 11.51 s; P = 0.008), decreased time in the target quadrant (7.32 ± 0.71 vs. 11.6 ± 1.99 s; P = 0.019), platform crossings (0.83 ± 0.4 vs. 2.5 ± 0.83; P < 0.001) and step-through latency (3.89 ± 1.14 vs. 12.43 ± 3.28 s; P = 0.011).

This study aimed to elucidate the specific mechanism of action of BMSC-derived exosomal Egr2 in OGD/R-induced neuronal cell damage. Exosomes were isolated from BMSCs. OGD/R-treated N2a cells were used for in vitro experiments. CCK8 and flow cytometry analysis were applied to measure cell viability, apoptosis, and BMSCs surface markers. Protein levels were analyzed using western blotting. The binding sites of Egr2 on the RNF8 promoter were predicted using the JASPAR database and verified using ChIP and dual-luciferase reporter assays. Co-IP was used to validate the relationship between RNF8 and DAPK1. Cellular localization of RNF8 and DRPK1 was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. Egr2 was enriched in BMSC-derived exosomes. Exosomal Egr2 isolated from BMSCs increased the viability and reduced the apoptosis of OGD/R-treated N2a cells. However, these effects were abrogated by Egr2 knockdown. Egr2 activated RNF8 by binding to its promoter. In addition, RNF8 negatively regulated DAPK1 by promoting DAPK1 ubiquitination to alleviate OGD/R-stimulated neuronal cell damage. RNF8 overexpression or DAPK1 knockdown reversed OGD/R and Egr2 knockdown in BMSC co-treated with neuronal cell injury.

This study compared the 1-year surgical outcomes of recession and resection (RR) between patients with ANP (ANP group, 11 patients) and those with concomitant ET (ET group, 33 patients). The target angle of RR for ANP was added by 5 prism diopters (Δ) compared to concomitant ET. The 1-year corrective effect was relatively lower in the ANP group than in the ET group (2.1 ± 0.7 Δ/mm vs. 2.6 ± 0.6 Δ/mm, P = 0.07), but the 3-month effect was similar (2.3 ± 0.6 Δ/mm vs. 2.6 ± 0.6 Δ/mm, P = 0.31) because significantly larger drift occurred in the ANP group than in the ET group (2.3 ± 2.2 Δ vs. 0.2 ± 2.7 Δ, P = 0.03).

40571692,"Longitudinal patterns of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder children in Shanghai, China.","This study aimed to assess dynamic changes in emotional and behavioral problems among children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in Shanghai, China. Using a longitudinal design, school-aged children with ADHD were enrolled and followed, with emotional and behavioral measures repeatedly assessed. Due to varying COVID-19 measures and changing epidemics, and no intervention was admitted, an event-based longitudinal design was adopted, using calendar time from the enrollment of the first participant. Data collection spanned various pandemic control stages, including the Shanghai lockdown (March 28-May 31, 2022). Emotional and behavioral trends were analyzed using a Generalized Additive Model to capture the nonlinear dynamics effectively. Overall, 1102 children with ADHD (mean: 9.2 ± 2.4 years, 83% boys) were enrolled. Emotional and behavioral issues fluctuated over time. Behavioral problems, including inattention, hyperactivity, and conduct issues, peaked around day 260 of isolation and then declined but resurged after the Shanghai lockdown. Emotional issues, such as anxiety and depression, showed a dual-peak pattern, with early pandemic rises and a second peak around day 400. Symptoms rebounded after lockdown and persisted for an extended period. Sub-analyses revealed that boys had higher scores in hyperactivity and oppositional defiance than girls, with no significant gender differences in emotional problems. ADHD-PI children had higher emotional problem scores, while ADHD-HI children exhibited more severe behavioral issues.

40571688,"Comparative effects of sensory motor and virtual reality interventions to improve gait, balance and quality of life MS patients.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disorder that affects the central nervous system, causing inflammation and damage to the myelin sheath, leading to balance and gait impairments. Sensory-motor (SN) and virtual reality (VR) interventions have shown promise in addressing these balance issues by engaging all three components of the balance control systems. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of sensory-motor and virtual reality training on the functional status and quality of life of MS patients. In this study, 36 MS patients receiving Rituximab therapy with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 2 to 6 were randomly assigned to three groups: SN (n = 10), VR (n = 8), and a control group (n = 10). The SN and VR groups underwent 8 weeks of intervention, with 3 sessions per week, while the control group continued routine care. Assessments using the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) test, the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 54 Instrument (MSQOL54), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were conducted at baseline and after 8 weeks. Significant within-group improvements were observed in both SN and VR groups for primary outcomes, including the T25FW (P = 0.002 for SN; P = 0.001 for VR) and TUG (P = 0.005 for SN; P = 0.001 for VR), as well as secondary outcomes such as overall (P < 0.001 for both), physical (P < 0.001 for both), and mental (P < 0.001 for both) MSQOL-54 components, and PSQI (P < 0.001 for SN; P = 0.046 for VR). However, no significant differences emerged between SN and VR groups for primary outcomes, except for PSQI, which favored SN (P = 0.02). Compared to the control group, the SN group demonstrated significant improvements in primary outcomes-T25FW (P < 0.001) and TUG (P = 0.01)-and secondary outcomes, including overall (P < 0.001), physical (P < 0.001), and mental (P = 0.002) MSQOL-54 components, and PSQI (P = 0.007). Similarly, compared to the control group, the VR group demonstrated significant improvements in the T25FW (P = 0.02) and TUG (P = 0.05) tests, as well as in secondary outcomes, including overall (P = 0.005), physical (P = 0.003), and mental (P = 0.01) MSQOL-54 components.

40571679,Daily electric field treatment improves functional outcomes after thoracic contusion spinal cord injury in rats.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) can cause permanent loss of sensory, motor, and autonomic functions, with limited therapeutic options available. Low-frequency electric fields with changing polarity have shown promise in promoting axon regeneration and improving outcomes. However, the metal electrodes used previously were prone to corrosion, and their epidural placement limited the penetration of the electric field into the spinal cord. Here, we demonstrate that a thin-film implant with supercapacitive electrodes placed under the dura mater can safely and effectively deliver electric field treatment in rats with thoracic SCI. Subdural stimulation enhanced hind limb function and touch sensitivity compared to controls, without inducing a neuroinflammatory response in the spinal cord. While axon density around the lesion site remained unchanged after 12 weeks, in vivo monitoring and electrochemical testing of electrodes indicated that treatment was administered throughout the study.

40571677,Consensus on the Treatment of Severe Ocular Trauma and Silicone Oil-Dependent Eyes Using Foldable Capsular Vitreous Body.,"To establish evidence-based guidelines for the application of the foldable capsular vitreous body (FCVB) in managing severe ocular trauma and silicone oil-dependent eyes. We conducted a comprehensive search across multiple databases, screening, extracting, and evaluating research evidence. Experts in ocular trauma and vitreoretinal surgery provided practical insights and formulated key questions. Using the Delphi method, the working group identified seven clinical issues and established outcome indicators. Seven recommendations were developed, reviewed, and approved by a multinational consensus expert group. This consensus presents seven evidence-based recommendations for FCVB implantation, emphasizing the importance of patient assessment, FCVB model selection, and intraoperative and postoperative management.

40571660,Potential role of FNDC5 in exercise-induced improvement of cognitive function.,"Cognitive dysfunction often occurs in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cerebrovascular disease, or other neurodegenerative diseases, and can significantly impact the life quality of patients and create serious social, psychological, and economic burdens for individuals and their families. Numerous studies have confirmed that exercise can slow the decline in cognitive function through multiple pathways, in which fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) plays an important role. However, the current research on the modulation of FNDC5 by exercise and its ability to improve hippocampal cognitive function lacks a systematic and comprehensive understanding. Therefore, this review focuses on the latest research progress regarding the role of exercise-induced FNDC5 in cognitive function, systematically reviews the positive effects of FNDC5 on cognitive function impairment caused by various factors, and clarifies the specific mechanisms by which exercise-induced FNDC5 improves cognitive function by inhibiting neuroinflammation and improving hippocampal neurogenesis and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Based on the existing literature, we also identify the areas that require further research in this field. Overall, this review provides a theoretical basis for exercise-based prevention and improvement of cognitive function impairment.",Journal of Zhejiang University. Science.

40571632,Ameliorative Effects of Sweeteners on a Mouse Jet Lag Model.,"Circadian rhythms regulate essential physiological functions, including body temperature and hormone secretion, in a 24-h cycle. These rhythms are synchronized with environmental cues, primarily light, through the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Disruptions, such as jet lag, misalign internal rhythms with external time, leading to fatigue and insomnia. This study explores the potential of dietary sweetening agents as non-pharmacological interventions to facilitate circadian re-entrainment in a mouse jet lag model. Male C57BL/6 mice, maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle, underwent a 6-h phase advance to simulate jet lag. Mice received drinking water with or without sweeteners (sucrose, sucralose, xylitol, maltitol), and locomotor activity was assessed using wheel-running behavior and intraperitoneally implanted nanotags measuring 3dimensional acceleration and body temperature. Sucrose and sucralose significantly accelerated re-entrainment, with phase-shifting rates of 0.93 and 1.28 h/d, respectively, compared to 0.76 h/d in controls. Both sweeteners also enhanced post-shift activity, whereas xylitol had a minor effect and maltitol showed no significant impact. Sweeteners did not affect rest duration during the jet lag period. These findings indicate that sweet taste can facilitate circadian adaptation, offering a potential dietary approach to mitigate jet lag symptoms. This study provides insights into how taste perception influences circadian regulation, with implications for managing circadian misalignment in frequent travelers and shift workers.",Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2025.0,Jiayi Li; Tian Xiang Gao; Jun Tomita; Kazuhiko Kume,circadian rhythm regulate essential physiological function include body temperature hormone secretion 24 h cycle rhythm synchronize environmental cue primarily light suprachiasmatic nucleus disruption jet lag misalign internal rhythm external time lead fatigue insomnia study explore potential dietary sweetening agent non pharmacological intervention facilitate circadian entrainment mouse jet lag model male c57bl/6 mouse maintain 12 h light dark cycle undergo 6 h phase advance simulate jet lag mouse receive drinking water sweetener sucrose sucralose xylitol maltitol locomotor activity assess wheel run behavior intraperitoneally implant nanotag measure 3dimensional acceleration body temperature sucrose sucralose significantly accelerate entrainment phase shift rate 0.93 1.28 h d respectively compare 0.76 h d control sweetener enhance post shift activity xylitol minor effect maltitol show significant impact sweetener affect rest duration jet lag period finding indicate sweet taste facilitate circadian adaptation offer potential dietary approach mitigate jet lag symptom study provide insight taste perception influence circadian regulation implication manage circadian misalignment frequent traveler shift worker

We have reported a new subgroup of psychiatric disorders by a data-driven analysis of subcortical volumes of brain MRI in 5602 subjects, including patients with psychiatric disorders and controls. This subgroup of patients is characterized by enlarged ventricle and cognitive impairment (EVCI) with a high proportion of schizophrenia, electroencephalography abnormalities, and rare pathological copy number variations. Of the nine patients with EVCI, eight patients had schizophrenia, and one patient had autism spectrum disorder. Early onset of age was observed in eight patients with schizophrenia. Treatment responses were poor in seven patients with schizophrenia, and two of three treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients responded to clozapine. Four patients showed ischemic changes in cerebral white matter. In electroencephalography, abnormal findings were observed in five patients, borderline findings in two patients, and normal findings in two patients. Rare pathogenic copy number variations were found in three patients (22q11.21 deletion, 7q11.23 duplication, and 7q36.2 deletion).

40571594,The increased risk of exposure to fine particulate matter for depression incidence is mediated by elevated TNF-R1: the Healthy Aging Longitudinal Study.,"Depression among older adults is an important public health issue, and air and noise pollution have been found to contribute to exacerbation of depressive symptoms. This study examined the association of exposure to air and noise pollutants with clinically-newly-diagnosed depressive disorder. The mediating role of individual pro-inflammatory markers was explored. We linked National Health Insurance claim data with 2998 healthy community-dwellers aged 55 and above who participated in the Healthy Aging Longitudinal Study between 2009 and 2013. Newly diagnosed depressive disorder was identified using diagnostic codes from the medical claim data. Pollutants were estimated using nationwide land use regression, including PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and road traffic noise. Cox proportional hazard models were employed to examine the association between pollutants and newly developed depressive disorders. The mediating effect of serum pro-inflammatory biomarkers on the relationship was examined. Among the 2998 participants, 209 had newly diagnosed depressive disorders. In adjusted Cox proportional hazard models, one interquartile range increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> (8.53 µg/m<sup>3</sup>) was associated with a 17.5% increased hazard of developing depressive disorders. Other air pollutants and road traffic noise were not linearly associated with depressive disorder incidence. Levels of serum tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 mediated the relationship between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and survival time to newly onset depressive disorder. PM<sub>2.5</sub> is related to an increased risk of newly developed depressive disorder among middle-aged and older adults, and the association is partially mediated by the pro-inflammatory marker TNF-R1.",Environmental health and preventive medicine,2025.0,Ta-Yuan Chang; Ting-Yu Zhuang; Yun-Chieh Yang; Chih-Cheng Hsu; Wan-Ju Cheng,depression old adult important public health issue air noise pollution find contribute exacerbation depressive symptom study examine association exposure air noise pollutant clinically newly diagnose depressive disorder mediating role individual pro inflammatory marker explore link national health insurance claim datum 2998 healthy community dweller age 55 participate healthy aging longitudinal study 2009 2013 newly diagnose depressive disorder identify diagnostic code medical claim datum pollutant estimate nationwide land use regression include pm < sub>2.5</sub > pm < sub>10</sub > carbon monoxide ozone nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide road traffic noise cox proportional hazard model employ examine association pollutant newly develop depressive disorder mediating effect serum pro inflammatory biomarker relationship examine 2998 participant 209 newly diagnose depressive disorder adjust cox proportional hazard model interquartile range increase pm < sub>2.5</sub > 8.53 µg m < sup>3</sup > associate 17.5 increase hazard develop depressive disorder air pollutant road traffic noise linearly associate depressive disorder incidence level serum tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 mediate relationship pm < sub>2.5</sub > survival time newly onset depressive disorder pm < sub>2.5</sub > relate increase risk newly develop depressive disorder middle aged old adult association partially mediate pro inflammatory marker tnf r1

Potential associations with other neurological and psychiatric diseases have not been studied. The basis of this study was the Stockholm Sodium Cohort, a laboratory data repository covering inhabitants of the Stockholm Region who had a sodium concentration analyzed (2005-2018, n = 1632,249). Patients admitted with profound hyponatremia for the first time during the study period where sodium correction rates during the first 24 h could be calculated were included. Sodium correction ≤8 and >8 mmol/L/24 h was compared. Hospitalization with profound hyponatremia occurred in 7623 individuals, 3199 (42.0 %) were males, and the median age was 70 years (IQR 59-80 years). Alcohol misuse was present in 18.3 %, a neurological and/or psychiatric disease in 52.4 % and hypokalemia in 27.9 %. The recommended correction rate ≤8 mmol/L/24 h was adhered to in 3985 (52.3 %) patients. Seven patients (0.09 %) were diagnosed with ODS, six had a correction rate >8 mmol/L/24 h (compared to 1 patient with a correction rate ≤8 mmol/L, P = 0.0441). The risk of new neurological or psychiatric diseases did not differ significantly between those with a correction rate ≤8 mmol/L/24 h and those above in the fully adjusted model (adjusted hazard ratio 1.02 95 %CI 0.89-1.17)) nor in the subgroups.

40571426,Prognostic predictions in psychosis: exploring the complementary role of machine learning models.,"Predicting outcomes in schizophrenia spectrum disorders is challenging due to the variability of individual trajectories. While machine learning (ML) shows promise in outcome prediction, it has not yet been integrated into clinical practice. Understanding how ML models (MLMs) can complement psychiatrists' predictions and bridge the gap between MLM capabilities and practical use is key. This vignette study aims to compare the performance of psychiatrists and MLMs in predicting short-term symptomatic and functional remission in patients with first-episode psychosis and explore whether MLMs can improve psychiatrists' prognostic accuracy. 24 psychiatrists predicted symptomatic and functional remission probabilities at 10 weeks based on written baseline information from 66 patients in the OPtimization of Treatment and Management of Schizophrenia in Europe (OPTiMiSE) trial. ML-generated predictions based on these vignettes were then shared with psychiatrists, allowing them to adjust their estimates. The predictive accuracy of the MLM was low but comparable to that of psychiatrists for symptomatic remission (MLM: 0.50, psychiatrists: 0.52) and comparable to that of psychiatrists for functional remission (MLM: 0.72, psychiatrists: 0.79). Inter-rater agreement was low but comparable for psychiatrists and the MLM. Although the MLM did not improve overall predictive accuracy, it showed potential in aiding psychiatrists with difficult-to-predict cases. However, psychiatrists struggled to recognise when to rely on the model's output, and we were unable to determine a clear pattern in these cases based on their characteristics. MLMs may have the potential to support psychiatric decision-making, particularly in difficult-to-predict cases, but at present, their effectiveness remains limited due to constraints in predictive accuracy and the ability to identify when to rely on the model's output. Addressing these issues is crucial to improve the utility of MLMs and foster their integration into clinical practice. MLMs are best suited as supplementary tools, providing a second opinion while psychiatrists retain decision-making autonomy. Integrating predictions from both sources may help reduce individual biases and improve accuracy. This approach leverages the strengths of MLMs without compromising clinical responsibility.",BMJ mental health,2025.0,Violet van Dee; Seyed M Kia; Caterina Fregosi; Wilma E Swildens; Anne Alkema; Albert Batalla; Coen van den Berg; Danko Coric; Edwin van Dellen; Lotte G Dijkstra; Arthur van den Doel; Livia S Dominicus; John Enterman; Frank L Gerritse; Marte Z van der Horst; Fedor van Houwelingen; Charlotte S Koch; Lisanne E M Koomen; Marjan Kromkamp; Michelle Lancee; Brian E Mouthaan; Diane F van Rappard; Eline J Regeer; Raymond W J Salet; Metten Somers; Jorgen Straalman; Marjolein H T de Vette; Judith Voogt; Inge Winter-van Rossum; Rene S Kahn; Wiepke Cahn; Hugo G Schnack,predict outcome schizophrenia spectrum disorder challenge variability individual trajectory machine learning ml show promise outcome prediction integrate clinical practice understand ml model mlms complement psychiatrist prediction bridge gap mlm capability practical use key vignette study aim compare performance psychiatrist mlm predict short term symptomatic functional remission patient episode psychosis explore mlm improve psychiatrist prognostic accuracy 24 psychiatrist predict symptomatic functional remission probability 10 week base write baseline information 66 patient optimization treatment management schizophrenia europe optimise trial ml generate prediction base vignette share psychiatrist allow adjust estimate predictive accuracy mlm low comparable psychiatrist symptomatic remission mlm 0.50 psychiatrist 0.52 comparable psychiatrist functional remission mlm 0.72 psychiatrist 0.79 inter rater agreement low comparable psychiatrist mlm mlm improve overall predictive accuracy show potential aid psychiatrist difficult predict case psychiatrist struggle recognise rely model output unable determine clear pattern case base characteristic mlm potential support psychiatric decision making particularly difficult predict case present effectiveness remain limited constraint predictive accuracy ability identify rely model output address issue crucial improve utility mlm foster integration clinical practice mlm well suit supplementary tool provide second opinion psychiatrist retain decision make autonomy integrate prediction source help reduce individual bias improve accuracy approach leverage strength mlm compromise clinical responsibility
40571425,"Associations of adolescent mental health and parental education with healthcare use: a cohort study based on data from the Young-HUNT study, Norway.","Adolescent mental health problems and mental health help-seeking have increased in the later decades. We aimed to assess to which extent adolescents with high mental health symptom loads received help in general practice or specialist mental health services, and whether parental education influenced the association. This cohort study included 7554 Norwegian adolescents who participated in the population-based Young-HUNT4 Survey (2017-2019). They reported their mental health by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), measuring both internalising and externalising symptoms, summed up to a Total Difficulties score. During 1 year after participation, data on contacts with and diagnoses from general practice and specialist mental health services were collected from national registries. We used generalised linear models to analyse the probability of contact with general practice and specialist mental health services by low, moderate and high SDQ scores. We evaluated effect measure modification using interaction terms. Among adolescents with high total, internalising or externalising SDQ scores, 29-31% of females and 19-21% of males consulted a general practitioner for mental health problems, compared with 9-10% and 6-7% among those with low scores. Males and females with high internalising scores had a nine times increased risk of specialist mental health service contacts with internalising diagnoses, and similar associations were found for externalising scores and contacts/diagnoses. The associations were largely independent of parental education level.

40571424,Coping strategies for climate change anxiety: a perspective on building resilience through psychological capital.,"As the global impacts of climate change become more apparent, there is a corresponding increase in the psychological effects of the phenomenon, including climate change anxiety, stress and helplessness or hopelessness. Positive psychology provides a promising approach for tackling these mental health challenges by consolidating mental strength and building resilience. In this article, we consider how positive psychological coping mechanisms can lessen the negative impacts of climate change on mental health, especially in vulnerable populations. Based on evidence-based concepts such as psychological capital, positive psychology interventions seek to empower individuals, bolstering their capacity for optimism, self-efficacy and problem solving. By transforming anxiety into proactive behaviour, interventions such as mindfulness, cognitive reframing and encouraging environmental engagement could assist individuals in navigating the emotional toll of climate change. Although these strategies are not a solution to the climate crisis itself, they are adaptative strategies that equip individuals and communities with the means to cope with climate-related challenges more effectively and take positive actions. This perspective note also addresses the significance of incorporating these techniques into public health educational initiatives and policy-making, highlighting the necessity of accessible interventions that can be tailored to various cultural and socioeconomic contexts. Accordingly, we specifically discuss how positive psychology can be leveraged to foster resilience and hope, providing insight into how these concepts can support mental health and well-being in an era of climate change crisis.",BMJ mental health,2025.0,Thomas Kwame Osei Atta Nimo; Hansen Akoto-Baako; Ebenezer Oduro Antiri; Edward Wilson Ansah,global impact climate change apparent corresponding increase psychological effect phenomenon include climate change anxiety stress helplessness hopelessness positive psychology provide promising approach tackle mental health challenge consolidate mental strength building resilience article consider positive psychological cope mechanism lessen negative impact climate change mental health especially vulnerable population base evidence base concept psychological capital positive psychology intervention seek empower individual bolster capacity optimism self efficacy problem solving transform anxiety proactive behaviour intervention mindfulness cognitive reframing encourage environmental engagement assist individual navigate emotional toll climate change strategy solution climate crisis adaptative strategy equip individual community mean cope climate relate challenge effectively positive action perspective note address significance incorporate technique public health educational initiative policy making highlight necessity accessible intervention tailor cultural socioeconomic contexts accordingly specifically discuss positive psychology leveraged foster resilience hope provide insight concept support mental health era climate change crisis

40571385,Facilitation of a Centralized Recovery Center Through Air and Ground Critical Care Transport.,"Organ transplantation is an operationally complex process. Centralized recovery centers (CRCs) address multiple logistical issues while decreasing costs and increasing organ transplanted per donor (OTPD). This paradigm is predicated on the safe and effective transport of neurologically deceased donors from index facilities. Although the merits of CRCs are well studied, these transport processes have not been well assessed. We set out to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of transporting brain-dead organ donors through air and ground critical care transport. We completed a comprehensive review of our processes and retrospective chart review of all donor transports from index hospitals to the local CRC in an 18-month period. Clinical and transport data were both electronically and manually abstracted from 2 existing databases. Crews transported 74 donors (32 by air, 42 by ground) resulting in 257 organs transplanted (OTPD3.67). Median operating room time was 237 (interquartile range 205-292) minutes. Donors required a median of 2 (interquartile range 0-3) infusions and a mean norepinephrine equivalent of 0.02 µg/kg/min (standard deviation 0.06). One patient (1.4%) required blood products, 6 (8.1%) developed new hypotension, and 4 (5.4%) had new hypoxemia. There were no cardiac arrests in transport. Through a thoughtful collaboration between a busy organ procurement organization and well-established regional air and ground critical care transport service, in 18 months our system moved 74 donors from index hospitals to a new CRC for organ procurement.

40571342,Diagnosis of Australasian Patients with Neuromuscular Disease: Insights from a Comprehensive Panel Approach.,"Neurogenetic disorders are a large group of genetic and phenotypically heterogeneous diseases, making diagnosis challenging. Sequencing hundreds of disease genes concurrently using massively parallel sequencing is, therefore, invaluable for diagnosis of these disorders. The PathWest neuromuscular disease gene panels include all known genes associated with neurologic and muscle disorders. Initially implemented in 2013, covering 336 genes, the gene panel has undergone various updates in chemistries and seen the addition of many newly described neurogenic disease genes. The results from versions 3 and 5 of the panel are reported, which included 644 and 830 genes, respectively. In total, 3961 patients were tested across 20 phenotypic subpanels: 2740 on version 3 and 1221 on version 5. Overall diagnostic success was 23.0%, with 8.4% of diagnoses attributed to newly added genes. Diagnostic success varied greatly between phenotypic subpanels, from 63.4% for the congenital muscular dystrophy subpanel to 2.6% for the Alzheimer disease/frontotemporal dementia subpanel. The five most frequently reported genes, DMD, RYR1, SPG7, PMP22, and NOTCH3, accounted for 22% of all diagnoses.

40571293,A Medical Student Curriculum on Functional Medical Disorders.,"Functional medical disorders (FMDs) refer to persistent physical symptoms that cause impairment or disability, but which cannot be explained by routine medical testing. Negative perceptions towards FMDs exist amongst a variety of healthcare professionals, including medical students. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a course addressing FMDs for medical students in their first year of clinical training, which was integrated within the formal medical school curriculum. A multidisciplinary team of eight healthcare professionals delivered seven teaching sessions, each two hours in length, over six weeks. The curriculum was delivered via a combination of didactic teaching, small group tutorials and sessions with simulated patients. Pre- and post-course validated questionnaires assessed knowledge of, attitudes towards and confidence around irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Students undertook a two-station objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), which assessed their ability to take a clinical history from and communicate a diagnosis to simulated patients with IBS and fibromyalgia. Twenty-seven students completed the pre- and post-course surveys, which demonstrated an increase in knowledge of FMDs at course conclusion (88.89% vs. 57.50%, p < 0.001). Students' confidence ratings increased in all (100%) domains relating to FMDs: pathophysiology, symptoms, investigations for diagnosis and communicating a diagnosis (p < 0.001, all analyses). There was a statistically significant improvement in attitude ratings towards FMDs in 11 of 12 (91.7%) questions. All (100%) students passed the OSCE.

40571214,"Mechanisms of action of ubiquitin-specific proteases, particularly ubiquitin-specific proteases 7, 8, and 25, in depression treatment.","Depression is one of the most common and debilitating mental disorders and one of the main causes of disability worldwide. Despite the progress made in the treatment of depression, approximately 20 %-40 % of patients with a major depressive episode do not show a clinical response to current antidepressant treatments. Approximately 85 % of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) experience a high relapse rate after recovering from an acute episode of major depression. Over the past decade, protein ubiquitination and deubiquitination have attracted considerable interest. An increasing number of studies have shown that ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) play essential roles in the pathogenesis of depression. USP is part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), a critical non-lysosomal pathway specific for protein degradation, and plays a significant role in presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins crucial for regulating neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. However, its potential contribution to the pathophysiology of depression has not yet been addressed in detail. Therefore, this review explores the potential of targeting USP as a novel approach to antidepressant treatment, focusing on the targets and mechanisms of USP in the regulation of depression. By providing insights into USP in preclinical research, this review aims to contribute to developing new therapeutic methods for enhancing the efficacy of antidepressant treatments.",Biochemical pharmacology,2025.0,Yue-Yue Zhang; Wei Guan; Yang Miao,depression common debilitate mental disorder main cause disability worldwide despite progress treatment depression approximately 20 -40 patient major depressive episode clinical response current antidepressant treatment approximately 85 patient major depressive disorder mdd experience high relapse rate recover acute episode major depression past decade protein ubiquitination deubiquitination attract considerable interest increase number study show ubiquitin specific protease usps play essential role pathogenesis depression usp ubiquitin proteasome system ups critical non lysosomal pathway specific protein degradation play significant role presynaptic postsynaptic protein crucial regulate neurotransmission synaptic plasticity potential contribution pathophysiology depression address detail review explore potential target usp novel approach antidepressant treatment focus target mechanism usp regulation depression provide insight usp preclinical research review aim contribute develop new therapeutic method enhance efficacy antidepressant treatment
40571212,A photoswitchable positive allosteric modulator to control the activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 by light.,"The metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu<sub>5</sub>) is widely expressed in the brain, where it plays an important role in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, making it a therapeutic target of interest in various neurological disorders. In this study, we developed a photoswitchable positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of the mGlu<sub>5</sub>, as a novel tool for this clinically relevant drug target. To that aim, we used an azologisation strategy of the mGlu<sub>5</sub> PAM agonist VU0424465 leading to the molecule azoglurax. We observed a reversible photoisomerization of azoglurax in solution with optimal wavelengths of 365 nm and 435 nm for trans to cis and cis to trans isomerization, respectively. In cell-based assays, azoglurax potentiates the agonist-induced activity of mGlu<sub>5</sub> with a sub-micromolar potency in the dark. This potency is reduced under UV illumination. Similar to its parent molecule, azoglurax acts as an allosteric agonist of mGlu<sub>5</sub>, activating the receptor in the absence of glutamate, as demonstrated on a glutamate-insensitive mutant receptor. Docking and site-directed mutagenesis experiments also suggest that azoglurax and VU0424465 bind the same pocket. In addition, molecular dynamics on cis-azoglurax-bound mGlu<sub>5</sub> suggests that its azoglurax cis isomer does not bind stably in the receptor, in contrast to the trans-isomer, explaining the difference of activity between the two isomers. In conclusion, azoglurax is the first mGlu<sub>5</sub> photoswitchable PAM agonist reported to date, retaining the properties and the binding mode of its parent compound in the dark, while the insertion of an azobenzene confers light-regulated activity.",Biochemical pharmacology,2025.0,Anaëlle Dumazer; Roser Borras-Tuduri; Iona Truong; Xiaojing Cong; Fanny Malhaire; Xavier Rovira; Xavier Gomez-Santacana; Laurent Givalois; Guillaume Lebon; Amadeu Llebaria; Cyril Goudet,metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 mglu < sub>5</sub > widely express brain play important role synaptic plasticity learning memory make therapeutic target interest neurological disorder study develop photoswitchable positive allosteric modulator pam mglu < sub>5</sub > novel tool clinically relevant drug target aim azologisation strategy mglu < sub>5</sub > pam agonist vu0424465 lead molecule azoglurax observe reversible photoisomerization azoglurax solution optimal wavelength 365 nm 435 nm tran cis cis trans isomerization respectively cell base assay azoglurax potentiate agonist induce activity mglu < sub>5</sub > sub micromolar potency dark potency reduce uv illumination similar parent molecule azoglurax act allosteric agonist mglu < sub>5</sub > activate receptor absence glutamate demonstrate glutamate insensitive mutant receptor docking site direct mutagenesis experiment suggest azoglurax vu0424465 bind pocket addition molecular dynamic cis azoglurax bind mglu < sub>5</sub > suggest azoglurax cis isomer bind stably receptor contrast trans isomer explain difference activity isomer conclusion azoglurax mglu < sub>5</sub > photoswitchable pam agonist report date retain property bind mode parent compound dark insertion azobenzene confer light regulate activity
40571182,Regulation of Sociability by the Cortico-habenula Pathway in an Animal Model of Depression.,"Impaired sociability is a hallmark behavioral symptom frequently associated with depression. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is known to regulate both social behaviors and stress responses. Given the mPFC's projections to the lateral habenula (LHb) and the abnormal hyperactivity of the LHb observed in depression, the mPFC-LHb pathway may play a pivotal role in mediating impaired social behaviors in depressive disorders. Recent studies have reported increased activity of the mPFC-LHb pathway in depressive animal models. However, how this pathway responds to social stimuli and the synaptic dynamics underlying this process remain unexamined. Utilizing an acute learned helplessness (aLH) mouse model, we demonstrated that exposure to non-social stress resulted in heightened excitability and enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission at mPFC-LHb synapses. Furthermore, during social interactions, aLH mice exhibited significantly elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient signals in mPFC neurons projecting to the LHb. This synaptic enhancement was specifically observed in LHb neurons projecting to the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Importantly, optogenetic suppression of the mPFC-LHb pathway effectively restored sociability, underscoring its crucial role in the social deficits associated with depression. These findings highlight the mPFC-LHb pathway as a promising target for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying sociability deficits in depressive disorders.",Progress in neurobiology,2025.0,Hoyong Park; ChiHye Chung,impaired sociability hallmark behavioral symptom frequently associate depression medial prefrontal cortex mpfc know regulate social behavior stress response give mpfc projection lateral habenula lhb abnormal hyperactivity lhb observe depression mpfc lhb pathway play pivotal role mediate impair social behavior depressive disorder recent study report increase activity mpfc lhb pathway depressive animal model pathway respond social stimulus synaptic dynamic underlie process remain unexamined utilize acute learn helplessness alh mouse model demonstrate exposure non social stress result heighten excitability enhance excitatory synaptic transmission mpfc lhb synapsis furthermore social interaction alh mouse exhibit significantly elevated < sup>2+</sup > transient signal mpfc neuron project lhb synaptic enhancement specifically observe lhb neuron project ventral tegmental area vta importantly optogenetic suppression mpfc lhb pathway effectively restore sociability underscore crucial role social deficit associate depression finding highlight mpfc lhb pathway promising target investigate neural mechanism underlie sociability deficit depressive disorder
40571121,Hydroxysafflor yellow A attenuates the blood-brain barrier dysfunction and neuroinflammation through anti-inflammatory microglial polarization after intracerebral hemorrhage.,"The destruction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the most common life-threatening event of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Balancing microglia polarization is a prospective therapeutic strategy for BBB injury. This study aims to explore the neuroprotective effects and the underlying mechanisms of Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) from the perspective of BBB disruption and neuroinflammation. ICH was induced by intracerebral injection of collagenase Ⅶ in C57BL/6J male mice, and HSYA was injected through the tail vein for three days. We established three oral concentrations for HSYA and found that the administration of HSYA (20 mg/kg/d) significantly improved the neurological deficits of ICH mice and reversed the histopathological damage of the brain. Using IgG and Evans Blue staining, we demonstrated that HSYA prominently facilitated the BBB repair after ICH with no bleeding risk. HSYA greatly enhanced the expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5) but decreased MMP9. HSYA also significantly reduced the CD68<sup>+</sup> microglia with pro-inflammation mediators (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, iNOS, HO-1, and COX2) and increased the Arg-1<sup>+</sup> microglia with anti-inflammation mediators (IL-10, and TGF-β). We identified the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway through database mining and bioinformatics analysis and verified the activation of PI3K/Akt by HSYA intervention. Further, employing the PI3K-specific antagonist LY294002 confirmed that the pre-administration of LY294002 mostly negated the neuroprotective effects of HSYA. HSYA activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, balancing microglial polarization and improving BBB integrity, highlighting its potential to be an effective drug option for ICH treatment.",Neuropharmacology,2025.0,Fei Zheng; Guo Xiaohang; Qiuju Yan; Yaya Zhou; En Hu; Haonan Zhu; Menghan Cheng; Zhe Yu; Mingrui Hu; Ruoqi Ding; Haigang Li; Wei Zhang; Tao Tang; Yang Wang; Teng Li; Changqing Deng,destruction blood brain barrier bbb common life threaten event intracerebral hemorrhage ich balance microglia polarization prospective therapeutic strategy bbb injury study aim explore neuroprotective effect underlie mechanism hydroxysafflor yellow hsya perspective bbb disruption neuroinflammation ich induce intracerebral injection collagenase ⅶ c57bl/6j male mouse hsya inject tail vein day establish oral concentration hsya find administration hsya 20 mg kg d significantly improve neurological deficit ich mouse reverse histopathological damage brain igg evans blue stain demonstrate hsya prominently facilitate bbb repair ich bleed risk hsya greatly enhance expression tight junction protein zo-1 occludin claudin-5 decrease mmp9 hsya significantly reduce cd68 < sup>+</sup > microglia pro inflammation mediator il-1β il-6 tnf α inos ho-1 cox2 increase arg-1 < sup>+</sup > microglia anti inflammation mediator il-10 tgf β identify pi3k akt signal pathway database mining bioinformatics analysis verify activation pi3k akt hsya intervention employ pi3k specific antagonist ly294002 confirm pre administration ly294002 negate neuroprotective effect hsya hsya activate pi3k akt mtor signal pathway balance microglial polarization improve bbb integrity highlight potential effective drug option ich treatment

A five-year retrospective chart review from April 2019 to May 2024 was conducted, examining demographic, clinical, and systemic data for patients with prolonged admissions (LOS > 30 days) and delayed discharges. Clinician perspectives were gathered through semi-structured interviews; thematic analysis was applied to qualitative data to identify key themes related to discharge barriers. A total of 107 patients met criteria for prolonged LOS. Delays were most commonly attributed to systemic barriers, including limited access to inpatient psychiatric units and inadequate community-based support services, as well as patient-related factors such as complex psychiatric comorbidities (notably eating disorders and neurodevelopmental conditions). Clinician interviews highlighted additional themes, including resource constraints and challenges in discharge planning. Prolonged hospitalization for psychiatric reasons in medical wards was associated with significant strain on resources, delayed treatment, and increased safety concerns. Findings highlight the need for improved interagency collaboration, expanded access to psychiatric inpatient care, and the development of streamlined, resource-appropriate discharge pathways.

40571048,Sodium valproate's uncharted role in neuroprotection and neurotoxicity-A literature review.,"Sodium valproate (VPA), a widely used antiepileptic drug with good safety profile since many decades. It has increasingly demonstrated therapeutic potential in treating neurological disorders and offering neuroprotection. However, there are neurotoxic properties, underscoring its complex pharmacological profile. VPA works by boosting GABA, the brain's main inhibitory neurotransmitter to reduce nerve excitability and prevent seizures. In bipolar disorder, VPA stabilizes mood by modulating intracellular signaling pathways, including inhibition of histone deacetylases and modulation of G-protein-coupled receptor systems, which influence mood regulation and neuronal plasticity. VPA also prevents migraines by blocking sodium channels and pausing the brain wave disruptions that trigger migraine attacks. Emerging preclinical data suggest that VPA also plays a broader role in promoting neuronal survival, enhancing neuroplasticity, and protecting against neurodegenerative processes. However, despite its therapeutic efficacy, VPA's broad spectrum of action is accompanied by potential neurotoxicities. Chronic use of VPA is associated with adverse effects, including cognitive impairment, memory deficits, and motor dysfunction. Mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, excessive inhibition of histone deacetylase, imbalance in neurotransmitters and altered expression of neurotrophic factors are attributed to valproate-induced neurotoxicity. This review explores the neuroprotective effects as well as neurotoxic effects, with a focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying these diverse roles. Additionally, we discuss the challenges behind the failure of preclinical neuroprotective data to translate into successful clinical trials.

This review synthesizes preclinical data on artificial mitochondrial and EV transfer, emphasizing their therapeutic potential and underlying mechanisms. A systematic analysis of 123 animal studies revealed consistent benefits across diverse models, including ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), neurological disorders, drug-induced toxicities, and sepsis. Mitochondrial transfer improved organ function, reduced inflammation and apoptosis, and enhanced survival. Mechanistic insights revealed restored bioenergetics, increased oxidative phosphorylation, redox balance through activation of specific pathways, and modulation of mitochondrial dynamics via fusion/fission proteins. Mitochondrial homeostasis was supported through elevated mitophagy and biogenesis, alongside the preservation of mitochondrial-associated membranes. EV demonstrated similar effects, offering a potentially more targeted therapeutic alternative. Although pre-clinical studies have demonstrated safety and feasibility, broader application is limited by variability in isolation methods, lack of mechanistic clarity, and minimal human data.

Although psychiatric clinics play a central role in the care of these patients, the extensive, digitally collected routine data are rarely systematically evaluated. This study characterises the patient population of a large psychiatric clinic and analyses constants as well as developments in inpatient psychiatric care over an 18-year period.The retrospective analysis was based on longitudinal data from the hospital information system of the Evangelische Stiftung Tannenhof, which operates psychiatric clinics in urban regions of the Bergisches Land. Anonymised data from 110,996 fully inpatient cases from the years 2005 to 2022 were included in the analysis. The study examined demographic characteristics, length of stay, psychiatric main discharge diagnoses, somatic comorbidities, and the development of prescribed medications.The gender ratio and age structure of the patients remained largely constant over the entire period. Diagnostically, there was a slight increase in psychotic disorders and organic psychiatric disorders, while substance use disorders slightly decreased. A significant increase was observed in somatic comorbidities and the number of prescribed medications, with somatic medication increasing disproportionately compared to psychiatric medication. The COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant increase in Z-diagnoses, indicating a need for action from a somatic perspective.The retrospective data analysis showed that demographic characteristics and diagnostic patterns remained largely stable. Meanwhile, the complexity of medication and the number of somatic comorbidities increased. These developments emphasise the growing need for expertise in both somatic and psychiatric medication in clinical practice.

40570863,Understanding the drivers and consequences of early-onset type 2 diabetes.,"Early-onset type 2 diabetes (defined as type 2 diabetes diagnosed in people aged <40 years) is increasingly prevalent with substantial health and socioeconomic implications. Unlike late-onset type 2 diabetes, early-onset type 2 diabetes is a high-risk and aggressive phenotype, with accelerated pancreatic β-cell decline and greater insulin resistance due to the rising rate of obesity. People with early-onset type 2 diabetes have higher rates of macrovascular and microvascular complications with increased health-care use and premature mortality (due to cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular complications) than do people with late-onset type 2 diabetes. Emerging evidence also suggests that people with early-onset type 2 diabetes face an increased risk of complications in reproductive health (eg, during periconception and postpartum periods), metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease, mental health (eg, diabetes distress, depression, anxiety, and psychotic disorders), and some cancers, creating additional challenges in managing multiple long-term conditions. In this Series paper, we highlight the consequences of early-onset type 2 diabetes and the key driver for these risks-long duration of exposure to hyperglycaemia, with its effects amplified by younger age at type 2 diabetes diagnosis and interactions with other cardiometabolic risk factors. Recognising these adverse risks associated with early-onset type 2 diabetes is crucial for guiding the development and implementation of a more focused and integrated life-course approach to mitigate its long-term effect on individuals, communities, and health-care systems globally.

To address these challenges, the European Academy of Neurology (EAN), in collaboration with the European Federation of Autonomic Societies (EFAS) and the International Neuro-Urology Society (INUS), developed the NEUROGED guidelines. These guidelines aim to provide neurologists with evidence-based recommendations for managing neurogenic bladder and sexual dysfunctions. The task force comprised 37 members from 17 countries across four continents, highlighting a comprehensive and collaborative effort. The committee has established evidence-based recommendations for 11 key questions, consensus-based recommendations for eight questions, and good practice statements for 19, addressing the complexities of managing neurogenic urogenital dysfunction.

40570769,"Exploring the risk matrix of drug overdose deaths of young people: Drug use patterns, individual characteristics, circumstances, and environment.","The number of drug-induced deaths among young people has increased in Finland in recent years, and their proportion of all drug-induced deaths is among the highest in Europe. The aim of the multidisciplinary study was to explore individual, situational and environmental factors contributing to drug overdoses of young people in a non-heroin use setting. All drug overdose deaths (N = 300) of under 30-year-olds in Finland between 2019 and 2021 were investigated. The research material included police investigation reports, forensic autopsy reports, post-mortem toxicological reports, and death certificates. Public statistical indicators were used as secondary data. Of the deaths, 86.7 % were unintentional and 88.0 % were caused by poly-drug toxicity. In 53.7 %, substance use was recorded in the background documents, and 4.0 % had been in opioid agonist treatment at the time of death. The deceased had mental disorders in 51.6 % of the cases. Only 13.7 % were resuscitated by emergency care, as in most cases the person was either unresponsive or was found dead. The deceased lived in areas that are socially and economically disadvantaged compared to the average. Overdose deaths of young people result from a complex matrix of risk factors. It appears that, the treatment system has not effectively addressed the needs of the deceased, and the retention of health and social care has been inadequate. Additionally, help seems to have been called too late. Tailored interventions that acknowledge the known risks of drug overdoses are needed as well as political decisions that enable harm-reduction measures.",Drug and alcohol dependence,2025.0,Sanna Rönkä; Heta Konttinen; Pirkko Kriikku; Pekka Hakkarainen; Margareeta Häkkinen; Karoliina Karjalainen,number drug induce death young people increase finland recent year proportion drug induce death high europe aim multidisciplinary study explore individual situational environmental factor contribute drug overdose young people non heroin use set drug overdose death n = 300 30 year old finland 2019 2021 investigate research material include police investigation report forensic autopsy report post mortem toxicological report death certificate public statistical indicator secondary datum death 86.7 unintentional 88.0 cause poly drug toxicity 53.7 substance use record background document 4.0 opioid agonist treatment time death deceased mental disorder 51.6 case 13.7 resuscitate emergency care case person unresponsive find dead deceased live area socially economically disadvantage compare average overdose death young people result complex matrix risk factor appear treatment system effectively address need deceased retention health social care inadequate additionally help call late tailor intervention acknowledge know risk drug overdose need political decision enable harm reduction measure
40570755,Mixed reality holographic navigation for intracranial lesions using HoloLens 2: A pilot study and literature review.,"This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of HoloLens 2-based mixed reality (XR) holographic navigation for intracranial lesions in neurosurgery, comparing its performance with the conventional navigation system. A pilot study was conducted involving 20 patients with various intracranial lesions between March 2023 and May2025. Magnetic resonance imaging with/without computed tomography angiography imaging data were acquired for both the conventional navigation system and the HoloLens 2 platform. As for the XR technology, the process involved uploading imaging data to a cloud platform for three-dimensional reconstruction, followed by the creation of the holographic model. During surgery, the holographic model was downloaded onto the HoloLens 2, and a point-based registration method was employed to align the holographic model with the patient's anatomy. The localization accuracy and registration working times were compared between the two systems. The cohort included 20 participants (11 males, 9 females; mean age 47.8 ± 15.3 years) with diagnoses such as meningioma (10 cases), vascular lesions (5 cases), glioma (3 cases), and lymphoma (2 case). Both senior neurosurgeons agreed on the accuracy of HoloLens 2's holographic projections, which were comparable to conventional navigation. The average registration working time for the HoloLens 2 was 5.7 ± 2.0 min, significantly faster than the conventional navigation system (9.3 ± 2.9 min) (P < 0.001). Additionally, HoloLens 2 demonstrated shorter registration working times across different head positions. Preliminary findings suggest that HoloLens 2 can serve as a portable and efficient navigation tool in neurosurgery, offering comparable localization accuracy to the conventional navigation system while significantly reducing registration working time. This technology has the potential to enhance surgical procedures and improve healthcare delivery in grassroots settings, making advanced neurosurgical navigation more accessible. Further research with larger cohorts is expected to substantiate these concepts.",Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,2025.0,Zixiao Yang; Xingfen Su; Zhiyi Yuan; Yifan Yuan; Jian Liu; Zhicheng Wang; Ke Jin; Ningrong Ye; Jiakang Zhang; Jiajun Cai; Qiu Huang; Jianping Song,study aim evaluate feasibility efficacy hololens 2 base mixed reality xr holographic navigation intracranial lesion neurosurgery compare performance conventional navigation system pilot study conduct involve 20 patient intracranial lesion march 2023 may2025 magnetic resonance imaging computed tomography angiography imaging datum acquire conventional navigation system hololens 2 platform xr technology process involve upload imaging datum cloud platform dimensional reconstruction follow creation holographic model surgery holographic model download hololens 2 point base registration method employ align holographic model patient anatomy localization accuracy registration work time compare system cohort include 20 participant 11 male 9 female mean age 47.8 ± 15.3 year diagnosis meningioma 10 case vascular lesion 5 case glioma 3 case lymphoma 2 case senior neurosurgeon agree accuracy hololens 2 holographic projection comparable conventional navigation average registration working time hololens 2 5.7 ± 2.0 min significantly fast conventional navigation system 9.3 ± 2.9 min p < 0.001 additionally hololens 2 demonstrate short registration work time different head position preliminary finding suggest hololens 2 serve portable efficient navigation tool neurosurgery offer comparable localization accuracy conventional navigation system significantly reduce registration working time technology potential enhance surgical procedure improve healthcare delivery grassroots setting make advanced neurosurgical navigation accessible research large cohort expect substantiate concept
40570751,Four new bright members of the ZinPyr zinc fluorescence sensor family for live cell imaging.,"As the second most abundant trace element, zinc plays numerous roles in the human body. Not only tightly bound as structural component and co-factor of more than 3000 proteins, but also as labile bound zinc, so-called mobile Zn (mZn). This mZn occurs especially in the central nervous system, where it plays a fundamental role in signal transduction. Accordingly, dysregulated zinc homeostasis is linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Fluorescence sensors have emerged as powerful tools to unravel its role on the molecular level. With 20 members, the most prominent sensor family is the ZinPyr family that exploits a fluorescein platform equipped with usually two bis(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (DPA) as zinc binding units. Within this article, we report four new bright members of the ZinPyr family, ZP1(5-en), ZP1(6-en), ZP1(5-Me<sub>2</sub>en), and ZP1(6-Me<sub>2</sub>en), which are derived from the known sensors ZP1(5-CO<sub>2</sub>H) and ZP1(6-CO<sub>2</sub>H). Modification of these parent sensors with ethane-1,2-diamine (en) or N<sup>1</sup>,N<sup>2</sup>-dimethylethane-1,2-diamine (Me<sub>2</sub>en) yielded cell-permeable sensors that combine the low quantum yield of the zinc-free state Φ<sub>free</sub> (0.165(0) - 0.190(9)) of the parent sensors with a high turn-on (5) and dynamic range (4.2 - 5.4). These properties make the new sensors among the brightest sensors in the ZinPyr family. Live cell imaging demonstrated their ability to detect intracellular zinc with an approximate turn-on of 2-3. The sensors showed a vesicular localization, with ZP1(6-en) and ZP1(5-Me<sub>2</sub>en) also localizing in the nuclei.",Journal of trace elements in medicine and biology : organ of the Society for Minerals and Trace Elements (GMS),2025.0,Marisa F Jakobs; Annika M Pick; Max Carlsson; Simon Wittmann; Jörg Fahrer; Sabine Becker,"second abundant trace element zinc play numerous role human body tightly bind structural component co factor 3000 protein labile bind zinc call mobile zn mzn mzn occur especially central nervous system play fundamental role signal transduction accordingly dysregulate zinc homeostasis link pathogenesis neurodegenerative disease fluorescence sensor emerge powerful tool unravel role molecular level 20 member prominent sensor family zinpyr family exploit fluorescein platform equip usually bis(2 pyridylmethyl)amine dpa zinc bind unit article report new bright member zinpyr family zp1(5 en zp1(6 en zp1(5 < sub>2</sub > en zp1(6 < sub>2</sub > en derive know sensor zp1(5 co < sub>2</sub > h zp1(6 co < sub>2</sub > h modification parent sensor ethane-1,2 diamine en n < sup>1</sup>,n < sup>2</sup>-dimethylethane-1,2 diamine < sub>2</sub > en yield cell permeable sensor combine low quantum yield zinc free state φ < sub > free</sub > 0.165(0 0.190(9 parent sensor high turn 5 dynamic range 4.2 5.4 property new sensor bright sensor zinpyr family live cell imaging demonstrate ability detect intracellular zinc approximate turn 2 3 sensor show vesicular localization zp1(6 en zp1(5 < sub>2</sub > en localize nucleus"
40570742,Weight changes during treatment with low-sodium oxybate in two phase 3 clinical studies in participants with narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia.,"Low-sodium oxybate (LXB) is approved in the United States for treating cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness in patients aged ≥7 years with narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia in adults. This post hoc analysis evaluated LXB effects on weight in patients with narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia from two phase 3 studies. Adults with narcolepsy with cataplexy or idiopathic hypersomnia began LXB treatment during open-label titration (10-14 weeks), followed by 2-week stable-dose periods (SDP). Safety populations comprised 201 participants with narcolepsy (75 previously taking sodium oxybate) and 148 with idiopathic hypersomnia (oxybate-naive at study entry); most were overweight or obese at baseline (narcolepsy, 67 %; idiopathic hypersomnia, 60 %). Least-squares (LS) mean (95 % CI) weight changes at end of SDP were -1.0 (-2.2, 0.1), -3.5 (-4.7, -2.3), and -2.3 (-3.4, -1.1) kg in oxybate-naive participants with narcolepsy and normal weight, overweight, and obese, respectively, and 0.0 (-1.6, 1.6), -0.7 (-2.2, 0.8), and 0.3 (-1.1, 1.7) kg in participants with narcolepsy previously taking oxybate and normal weight, overweight, and obese, respectively. In oxybate-naive participants with idiopathic hypersomnia, LS mean (95 % CI) changes at end of SDP were -2.2 (-3.5, -0.8), -2.6 (-4.1, -1.2), and -3.4 (-4.9, -1.8) kg in normal weight, overweight, and obese participants, respectively. Weight loss ≥5 % at end of SDP occurred in 26 % of oxybate-naive participants with narcolepsy, 5 % of those with narcolepsy previously taking oxybate, and 30 % with idiopathic hypersomnia.

40570732,"Examining psychiatric and cognitive adverse effects of brivaracetam, clobazam, lacosamide, eslicarbazepine, and perampanel in a veteran population.","Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder, affecting approximately 50 million people worldwide. There is limited data on the use of newer anti-seizure medicines (ASMs) and their cognitive and psychiatric adverse effects (AEs), despite increasing use. We aimed to describe the AE profile of newer ASMs in the real-world veteran population with Epilepsy comparing those who develop cognitive or psychiatric AEs to those who did not. A retrospective analysis of veterans (n = 2636) diagnosed with epilepsy via ICD-10 codes was conducted in collaboration with the Veterans Affairs (VA) Office Quality and Patient Safety Analytics and Performance Integration program. Neurology notes of veterans diagnosed with epilepsy, between January 2011 and June 2022 across the VA system were sampled to evaluate cognitive and psychiatric AEs. For this index study, only patients who were prescribed any of the five newer anti-seizure medications (brivaracetam, clobazam, lacosamide, eslicarbazepine, and perampanel) were included. Selection of these ASMs were made a priori as these were the most recently approved ASMs for use in the VA. Among the 2636 Veterans that were included in the index study, median age (Q1-Q3) was 64 (50-73) years with 88.1 % male participants, a population known to have higher prevalence of psychiatric and cognitive disorders. Overall, 70.7 % White Veterans, and 6.5 % Hispanic. 86.8 % were prescribed lacosamide while only 4.1 %, 4.3 %, 4.4 %, and 4.8 % were prescribed perampanel, clobazam, brivaracetam, and eslicarbazepine respectively. Overall, 63 (2.4 %) and 39 (1.5 %) Veterans reported cognitive and psychiatric AEs, respectively. Veterans with epilepsy were more likely to experience cognitive AEs if they were independently older (p = 0.004) and on Perampanel (OR 2.58, p = 0.03). Similarly, psychiatric AEs were more likely among those on Perampanel (OR 4.49), whereas they were less frequent in those taking frequent lacosamide (OR 0.38). Cognitive or psychiatric AEs often lead to treatment discontinuation in this population. In a population of veterans with epilepsy, clinicians should exercise caution in monitoring for cognitive and psychiatric adverse effects prescribed with the newer ASMs. Further research could help elucidate the dosage and delay at which these side effects would occur after treatment initiation.",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,2025.0,Poojith Nuthalapati; Danny DeBonis; Margaret Gopaul; Chinenye M Okafor; Michelle Orner; Anthony D Jimenez; Hamada H Altalib,epilepsy chronic neurological disorder affect approximately 50 million people worldwide limited datum use new anti seizure medicine asms cognitive psychiatric adverse effect aes despite increase use aim describe ae profile new asm real world veteran population epilepsy compare develop cognitive psychiatric aes retrospective analysis veteran n = 2636 diagnose epilepsy icd-10 code conduct collaboration veterans affairs va office quality patient safety analytics performance integration program neurology note veteran diagnose epilepsy january 2011 june 2022 va system sample evaluate cognitive psychiatric aes index study patient prescribe new anti seizure medication brivaracetam clobazam lacosamide eslicarbazepine perampanel include selection asm priori recently approve asm use va 2636 veteran include index study median age q1 q3 64 50 73 year 88.1 male participant population know high prevalence psychiatric cognitive disorder overall 70.7 white veterans 6.5 hispanic 86.8 prescribe lacosamide 4.1 4.3 4.4 4.8 prescribe perampanel clobazam brivaracetam eslicarbazepine respectively overall 63 2.4 39 1.5 veteran report cognitive psychiatric aes respectively veteran epilepsy likely experience cognitive aes independently old p = 0.004 perampanel 2.58 p = 0.03 similarly psychiatric aes likely perampanel 4.49 frequent take frequent lacosamide 0.38 cognitive psychiatric ae lead treatment discontinuation population population veteran epilepsy clinician exercise caution monitoring cognitive psychiatric adverse effect prescribe new asm research help elucidate dosage delay effect occur treatment initiation
40570712,Honokiol rescues progranulin deficiency in pathogen-induced and genetically driven neurodegeneration: Bridging veterinary models with therapeutic development.,"Progranulin (PGRN), a crucial regulator of lysosomal function, is deficient in several neurodegenerative disorders. Restoring PGRN levels with small molecules presents a promising therapeutic strategy for these conditions. Honokiol (HNK), a polyphenolic compound known for its neuroprotective effects, has demonstrated potential in various neurodegenerative diseases (ND), though its precise mechanisms remain unclear. This study explores HNK's ability to upregulate PGRN expression in nerve cells and central nervous system tissues. Our results show that HNK enhances PGRN expression and lysosomal targeting in nerve cells, rescues PGRN deficiency in PHEV-infected models both in vitro and in vivo, and significantly increases brain PGRN levels in GRN haploinsufficient mice following oral administration. Collectively, these findings establish HNK's multimodal action as a promising therapeutic intervention for neurodegenerative conditions spanning both infectious (PHEV-mediated) and genetic (GRN-linked) etiologies of PGRN deficiency.",Veterinary microbiology,2025.0,Zezhao Cao; Wenqi He; Ruijie Hu; Yuzhu Chen; Jun Xue; Feng Gao; Yungang Lan,progranulin pgrn crucial regulator lysosomal function deficient neurodegenerative disorder restore pgrn level small molecule present promising therapeutic strategy condition honokiol hnk polyphenolic compound know neuroprotective effect demonstrate potential neurodegenerative disease nd precise mechanism remain unclear study explore hnk ability upregulate pgrn expression nerve cell central nervous system tissue result hnk enhance pgrn expression lysosomal target nerve cell rescue pgrn deficiency phev infect model vitro vivo significantly increase brain pgrn level grn haploinsufficient mouse follow oral administration collectively finding establish hnk multimodal action promising therapeutic intervention neurodegenerative condition span infectious phev mediate genetic grn link etiology pgrn deficiency
40570706,Trajectories of grief-related psychopathology: A decade after the MH17 plane disaster.,"Violent losses increase the risk for prolonged grief disorder (PGD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and major depressive disorder (MDD). Little is known about the course of grief-related psychopathology in the long term. Hence, we examined their latent trajectories, overlap, and predictors to enhance our understanding of differential long-term responses to violent loss. MH17-bereaved people (N = 299) completed annual self-report measures from one to nine years post-loss. Prolonged grief (PG), posttraumatic stress (PTS), and major depression (MD) symptom trajectories were identified using latent class growth modeling. Overlap in trajectory membership was examined using frequencies. Predictors of trajectory membership were examined using multinomial regression analyses. Four PG symptom trajectories emerged: low (41.0 %), moderate decreasing (34.2 %), high (13.5 %), and recovered (11.3 %). Four PTS symptom trajectories emerged: low (56.2 %), recovered (19.6 %), moderate increasing (17.6 %), and high (6.6 %). Four MD symptom trajectories emerged: low (55.7 %), moderate (19.6 %), moderate decreasing (15.1 %), and high (9.5 %). The findings indicate that if people report psychopathology, this often entails PGD by itself, and sometimes in combination with PTSD and MDD, yet rarely PTSD or MDD by itself. Around one in 20 people was assigned to all three high symptom trajectories. Different predictors were found across disorders. To conclude, most MH17-bereaved people reported low grief-related psychopathology, yet one in six reported high grief-related psychopathology levels (i.e., at least probable PGD, PTSD, or MDD) nearly a decade later. There is no indication of a delayed onset of grief-related psychopathology.",Journal of anxiety disorders,2025.0,Lieke C J Nijborg; Gerben J Westerhof; Justina Pociūnaitė-Ott; Maarten J J Kunst; Jos de Keijser; Lonneke I M Lenferink,violent loss increase risk prolonged grief disorder pgd posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd major depressive disorder mdd little know course grief relate psychopathology long term examine latent trajectory overlap predictor enhance understanding differential long term response violent loss mh17 bereave people n = 299 complete annual self report measure year post loss prolonged grief pg posttraumatic stress pts major depression md symptom trajectory identify latent class growth modeling overlap trajectory membership examine frequency predictor trajectory membership examine multinomial regression analysis pg symptom trajectory emerge low 41.0 moderate decrease 34.2 high 13.5 recover 11.3 pts symptom trajectory emerge low 56.2 recover 19.6 moderate increase 17.6 high 6.6 md symptom trajectory emerge low 55.7 moderate 19.6 moderate decrease 15.1 high 9.5 finding indicate people report psychopathology entail pgd combination ptsd mdd rarely ptsd mdd 20 people assign high symptom trajectory different predictor find disorder conclude mh17 bereaved people report low grief relate psychopathology report high grief relate psychopathology level i.e. probable pgd ptsd mdd nearly decade later indication delay onset grief relate psychopathology
40570696,Prevalence of Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD): A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) pooled prevalence across global and specific populations (e.g., military, clinical) and examined potential gender differences. We systematically searched five major databases (Web of Science, Scopus, PsycNET, Psych and behavioural sciences collection, PubMed) up to 31/01/2025 for peer-reviewed articles reporting CPTSD prevalence using validated ICD-11 assessments. Articles were assessed for quality using the JBI prevalence checklist; no studies were excluded. In total 138,681 participants from 167 studies were analysed. Gender-specific analyses were conducted where prevalence was reported by gender. A random-effects model with the meta package in R estimated the global pooled prevalence of CPTSD at 6.2 % (95 % CI [3.7 %, 10.3 %]). Prevalence varied across specific trauma-exposed population groups; highest in clinical (44.7 %), domestic violence/sexual abuse survivors (40.0 %), and military (36.4 %) samples, and lowest in emergency services (7.4 %). No gender difference in prevalence was observed. Findings suggest the support systems or selection processes inherent in emergency services may lower CPTSD risk. Conversely, extreme trauma, limited support, or cultural factors may explain elevated prevalence in military samples. High CPTSD prevalence in clinical samples highlight trauma's pervasive impact, underscoring the need for targeted treatment addressing both CPTSD and comorbidities (e.g., mood, anxiety disorders). The absence of gender differences contrasts with typically higher PTSD rates in women. Limitations include inconsistent trauma definitions and lack of clinician-administered instruments. Findings highlight the need for standardised data collection and reporting, gender-specific reporting, and recognition of CPTSD as a comorbidity in clinical settings.",Psychiatry research,2025.0,Phillipa Ann Huynh; Reuben Kindred; Kirsten Perrins; Kathleen de Boer; Stephanie Miles; Glen Bates; Maja Nedeljkovic,"systematic review meta analysis aim assess complex post traumatic stress disorder cptsd pool prevalence global specific population e.g. military clinical examine potential gender difference systematically search major database web science scopus psycnet psych behavioural science collection pubmed 31/01/2025 peer review article report cptsd prevalence validate icd-11 assessment article assess quality jbi prevalence checklist study exclude total 138,681 participant 167 study analyse gender specific analysis conduct prevalence report gender random effect model meta package r estimate global pool prevalence cptsd 6.2 95 ci 3.7 10.3 prevalence vary specific trauma expose population group high clinical 44.7 domestic violence sexual abuse survivor 40.0 military 36.4 sample low emergency service 7.4 gender difference prevalence observe finding suggest support system selection process inherent emergency service lower cptsd risk conversely extreme trauma limited support cultural factor explain elevated prevalence military sample high cptsd prevalence clinical sample highlight trauma pervasive impact underscore need target treatment address cptsd comorbiditie e.g. mood anxiety disorder absence gender difference contrast typically high ptsd rate woman limitation include inconsistent trauma definition lack clinician administer instrument finding highlight need standardised data collection reporting gender specific reporting recognition cptsd comorbidity clinical setting"
40570636,Metformin limits cerebral cavernous malformation development by targeting KLF4-mediated mitochondrial damage.,"Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) present prevalent vascular diseases of the central nervous system, which can result in hemorrhage and seizures. Metformin, a first-line antidiabetic with established safety profiles, demonstrates pleiotropic effects, including the inhibition of cellular proliferation, inflammation, and angiogenesis, all of which are implicated in the pathogenesis of CCM. However, the therapeutic benefits of metformin in the realm of CCM remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the effect of metformin on the growth of CCM lesions in Slco1c1 CreERT2; Pdcd10 <sup>fl/fl</sup> (Pdcd10<sup>BECKO</sup>) mice. Super-resolution confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to evaluate mitochondrial structure. The results showed that metformin administration significantly attenuated CCM lesion burden, reduced iron deposition, and decreased collagen accumulation in Pdcd10<sup>BECKO</sup> mice. Metformin also normalized the defects from PDCD10 deficiency, including disruption of tight junctions and excessive proliferation of endothelial cells. Moreover, metformin significantly improved mitochondrial structural anomalies and dysfunction associated with PDCD10 deficiency, characterized by the presence of mitochondrial puncta and the loss of cristae, followed by impaired mitochondrial membrane potential and increased mitoROS in endothelial cells with the mutation. Metformin provided these beneficial effects by downregulating KLF4. In conclusion, these findings indicate that metformin suppresses the development of CCM in Pdcd10<sup>BECKO</sup> mice by targeting KLF4-mediated mitochondrial damage, thereby providing promising prospects as a novel therapeutic approach for CCM.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2025.0,Cong Yan; Yongqing Ye; Nan Liu; Dongdong Zhang; Wenzhong Du; Ying Li; GuoFu Li; Chen Li; Jingwei Li; Shengji Ma; Zifeng Dai; ZiYu Xiong; Yuwen Wang; Chunyang Men; Rui Bi; Qianpeng Duan; Weishi Xu; Yuan Cao; Jiapei Du; Changbin Shi,cerebral cavernous malformation ccm present prevalent vascular disease central nervous system result hemorrhage seizure metformin line antidiabetic established safety profile demonstrate pleiotropic effect include inhibition cellular proliferation inflammation angiogenesis implicate pathogenesis ccm therapeutic benefit metformin realm ccm remain unclear study aim investigate effect metformin growth ccm lesion slco1c1 creert2 pdcd10 < sup > fl fl</sup > pdcd10 < sup > becko</sup > mouse super resolution confocal microscopy transmission electron microscopy tem employ evaluate mitochondrial structure result show metformin administration significantly attenuate ccm lesion burden reduce iron deposition decrease collagen accumulation pdcd10 < sup > becko</sup > mouse metformin normalize defect pdcd10 deficiency include disruption tight junction excessive proliferation endothelial cell metformin significantly improve mitochondrial structural anomaly dysfunction associate pdcd10 deficiency characterize presence mitochondrial puncta loss cristae follow impaired mitochondrial membrane potential increase mitoro endothelial cell mutation metformin provide beneficial effect downregulate klf4 conclusion finding indicate metformin suppress development ccm pdcd10 < sup > becko</sup > mouse target klf4 mediate mitochondrial damage provide promising prospect novel therapeutic approach ccm
40570595,The clinical utility of neurofilament light chain for early detection and prediction of disease burden and severity in neuronopathic Gaucher disease.,"Newborn screening, while enabling early diagnosis, poses challenges to correctly identifying and typing otherwise asymptomatic infants with neuropathic Gaucher disease (nGD). Glucosylsphingosine (Lyso-GL1) may be elevated at birth, but it does not help differentiate between nGD types. Neurofilament light chain (NfL), a neuronal cytoplasmic protein, is a marker for axonal damage and is associated with elevated levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood in lysosomal disorders characterized by neurodegeneration. In a prospective study (NCT02000310, 13-CFCT-07), NfL and Lyso-GL1 levels were assessed along with other neurological indicators in 35 GD patients (ages 6 months to 72 years: 8 GD1, 7 GD2, 20 GD3). Eighteen patients with other LSDs-with or without neurodegeneration-served as controls. In GD2, Lyso-GL1 was markedly elevated (range: 105-457 ng/mL), and all GD2 patients with neurological manifestations had elevated NfL. In GD3, Lyso-GL1 levels were highly variable, reflecting the clinical heterogeneity. NfL was elevated in 4 of 20 GD3 patients, all of whom had clinically discernable neurological involvement. All GD1 patients had normal NfL levels (max: 0.9 (ref:<1.63)) and near-normal Lyso-GL1 (maximum pretreatment: 10). Clinically, an abnormal Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) correlated with neurodegeneration. ABR was abnormal in all GD2 infants tested, while 65 % (13/20) of GD3 patients had normal auditory function. The combination of elevated NfL and Lyso-GL1 levels, along with abnormal ABR, can aid in the early identification of severe nGD-even in the absence of characteristic neurological symptoms-supporting the need for earlier diagnosis and timely clinical intervention.",Molecular genetics and metabolism,2025.0,Leah Svarny; Arooj Agha; Julia Dao; Bobby Sandhu; Margarita Ivanova; Ozlem Goker-Alpan,newborn screening enable early diagnosis pose challenge correctly identify type asymptomatic infant neuropathic gaucher disease ngd glucosylsphingosine lyso gl1 elevate birth help differentiate ngd type neurofilament light chain nfl neuronal cytoplasmic protein marker axonal damage associate elevated level cerebrospinal fluid csf blood lysosomal disorder characterize neurodegeneration prospective study nct02000310 13 cfct-07 nfl lyso gl1 level assess neurological indicator 35 gd patient age 6 month 72 year 8 gd1 7 gd2 20 gd3 eighteen patient lsd neurodegeneration serve control gd2 lyso gl1 markedly elevated range 105 457 ng ml gd2 patient neurological manifestation elevate nfl. gd3 lyso gl1 level highly variable reflect clinical heterogeneity nfl elevate 4 20 gd3 patient clinically discernable neurological involvement gd1 patient normal nfl level max 0.9 ref:<1.63 near normal lyso gl1 maximum pretreatment 10 clinically abnormal auditory brainstem response abr correlate neurodegeneration abr abnormal gd2 infant test 65 13/20 gd3 patient normal auditory function combination elevated nfl lyso gl1 level abnormal abr aid early identification severe ngd absence characteristic neurological symptom support need early diagnosis timely clinical intervention
40570562,Chronotype and substance use disorder: A systematic review with meta-analysis on the impact of circadian misalignment on psychopathology and clinical course.,"Circadian rhythms regulate essential biological functions such as sleep, hormonal secretion, mood regulation, and reward processing. Individual differences in circadian preference, known as chronotype, may influence the risk of developing psychiatric disorders. Specifically, evening preference has been associated with emotional dysregulation, impulsive behavior, and increased reward sensitivity, which are key factors in the development and maintenance of substance-related disorders. Despite growing evidence, the relationship between chronotype and substance use disorders has not yet been systematically evaluated. This review aimed to synthesize the available clinical literature and quantitatively assess the association between chronotype and substance use disorders. A systematic search identified studies examining the link between chronotype and diagnostic, symptomatic, or prognostic features of substance use disorders in clinical populations. The review found consistent evidence that evening preference is associated with earlier onset, higher symptom severity, and poorer treatment outcomes. Five studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled odds ratio showed that individuals with evening preference had a significantly higher likelihood of being diagnosed with a substance use disorder compared to those with morning preference (pooled odds ratio = 1.55, 95 percent confidence interval: 1.20 to 1.95). These findings suggest that circadian preference is a clinically relevant factor in the assessment and treatment of substance use disorders.",Sleep medicine reviews,2025.0,Luca Steardo; Martina D'Angelo; Valeria Di Stefano; Annarita Vignapiano; Ernesta Panarello; Francesco Monaco; Michele Fornaro; Luca Steardo,circadian rhythm regulate essential biological function sleep hormonal secretion mood regulation reward processing individual difference circadian preference know chronotype influence risk develop psychiatric disorder specifically evening preference associate emotional dysregulation impulsive behavior increase reward sensitivity key factor development maintenance substance relate disorder despite grow evidence relationship chronotype substance use disorder systematically evaluate review aim synthesize available clinical literature quantitatively assess association chronotype substance use disorder systematic search identify study examine link chronotype diagnostic symptomatic prognostic feature substance use disorder clinical population review find consistent evidence evening preference associate early onset high symptom severity poor treatment outcome study include meta analysis pool odd ratio show individual evening preference significantly high likelihood diagnose substance use disorder compare morning preference pool odd ratio = 1.55 95 percent confidence interval 1.20 1.95 finding suggest circadian preference clinically relevant factor assessment treatment substance use disorder
40570551,Subjective drug-effect ratings predict cannabis self-administration in people who use cannabis daily.,"As interest in the potential therapeutic benefits of cannabis-derived products grows, accurate predictors of abuse potential will be vital for informing regulatory decisions. Currently, the Food and Drug Administration recommends using subjective effect ratings of Drug Liking as the primary measure in human abuse potential studies. However, dissociations between subjective ratings and drug-taking behavior have been previously reported. This retrospective analysis determined if any subjective effects questionnaire items uniquely predicted cannabis self-administration in people who use cannabis daily (N = 89; 71 male and 18 female). Data from 4 previous studies across 2 research sites that included cannabis self-administration and subjective effects assessments were combined. Concentrations of Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahyrdocannabinol (THC) were similar across studies (5.5%, 5.6%, or 5.9%), although milligram THC dose varied based on administration procedures. Ratings of Good Effect, High, Sedated/Tired, Drug Liking, Stimulated, and Willingness to Take Again were used as predictors. In each study, a money option ($0.50 or $1.00) was scheduled as an alternative to cannabis puffs in self-administration procedures. Proportion of choices for cannabis puffs over total choice trials (3 or 8 trials) was used as the primary outcome. Generalized linear models revealed that higher ratings of Willingness to Take Again (OR = 1.04) were associated with increased odds of self-administering active THC cannabis, while higher ratings of Stimulated were associated with decreased odds of self-administering placebo cannabis (OR = 0.94). These results suggest that subjective ratings of Willingness to Take Again should be considered as a primary outcome when assessing abuse potential for novel cannabinoid products. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This retrospective analysis found that subjective ratings of Willingness to Take Again was a more predictive measure of cannabis self-administration than Drug Liking in people who use cannabis daily. Refining human abuse potential assessments to prioritize measures that better align with drug-taking behavior could improve regulatory evaluations of novel cannabinoid products.",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,2025.0,Thomas P Shellenberg; Justin C Strickland; Sean D Regnier; Preston T Tolbert; Stephanie Lake; Michael J Wesley; William W Stoops; Ziva D Cooper; Margaret Haney; Joshua A Lile,interest potential therapeutic benefit cannabis derive product grow accurate predictor abuse potential vital inform regulatory decision currently food drug administration recommend subjective effect rating drug liking primary measure human abuse potential study dissociation subjective rating drug take behavior previously report retrospective analysis determine subjective effect questionnaire item uniquely predict cannabis self administration people use cannabis daily n = 89 71 male 18 female datum 4 previous study 2 research site include cannabis self administration subjective effect assessment combine concentration δ < sup>9</sup>-tetrahyrdocannabinol thc similar study 5.5 5.6 5.9 milligram thc dose vary base administration procedure rating good effect high sedated tired drug liking stimulated willingness predictor study money option $ 0.50 $ 1.00 schedule alternative cannabis puff self administration procedure proportion choice cannabis puff total choice trial 3 8 trial primary outcome generalized linear model reveal high rating willingness = 1.04 associate increase odd self administer active thc cannabis high rating stimulated associate decrease odd self administer placebo cannabis = 0.94 result suggest subjective rating willingness consider primary outcome assess abuse potential novel cannabinoid product significance statement retrospective analysis find subjective rating willingness predictive measure cannabis self administration drug like people use cannabis daily refine human abuse potential assessment prioritize measure well align drug take behavior improve regulatory evaluation novel cannabinoid product
40570535,Deep learning-based diffusion MRI tractography: Integrating spatial and anatomical information.,"Diffusion MRI tractography technique enables non-invasive visualization of the white matter pathways in the brain. It plays a crucial role in neuroscience and clinical fields by facilitating the study of brain connectivity and neurological disorders. However, the accuracy of reconstructed tractograms has been a longstanding challenge. Recently, deep learning methods have been applied to improve tractograms for better white matter coverage, but often comes at the expense of generating excessive false-positive connections. This is largely due to their reliance on local information to predict long-range streamlines. To improve the accuracy of streamline propagation predictions, we introduce a novel deep learning framework that integrates image-domain spatial information and anatomical information along tracts, with the former extracted through convolutional layers and the latter modeled via a Transformer-decoder. Additionally, we employ a weighted loss function to address fiber class imbalance encountered during training. We evaluate the proposed method on the simulated ISMRM 2015 Tractography Challenge dataset, achieving a valid streamline rate of 66.2 %, white matter coverage of 63.8 %, and successfully reconstructing 24 out of 25 bundles. Furthermore, on the multi-site Tractoinferno dataset, the proposed method demonstrates its ability to handle various diffusion MRI acquisition schemes, achieving a 5.7 % increase in white matter coverage and a 4.1 % decrease in overreach compared to RNN-based methods.",NeuroImage,2025.0,Yiqiong Yang; Yitian Yuan; Baoxing Ren; Ye Wu; Yanqiu Feng; Xinyuan Zhang,diffusion mri tractography technique enable non invasive visualization white matter pathway brain play crucial role neuroscience clinical field facilitate study brain connectivity neurological disorder accuracy reconstructed tractogram longstanding challenge recently deep learning method apply improve tractogram well white matter coverage come expense generate excessive false positive connection largely reliance local information predict long range streamline improve accuracy streamline propagation prediction introduce novel deep learning framework integrate image domain spatial information anatomical information tract extract convolutional layer model transformer decoder additionally employ weighted loss function address fiber class imbalance encounter training evaluate propose method simulated ismrm 2015 tractography challenge dataset achieve valid streamline rate 66.2 white matter coverage 63.8 successfully reconstruct 24 25 bundle furthermore multi site tractoinferno dataset propose method demonstrate ability handle diffusion mri acquisition scheme achieve 5.7 increase white matter coverage 4.1 decrease overreach compare rnn base method
40570504,Hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy of neurometabolic lysosomal storage diseases.,"Neurometabolic disorders are rare, inherited monogenic diseases arising from mutations in genes whose products are essential for brain functions and cause local accumulation of toxic substrates. Central nervous system involvement can be severe, is progressive and frequently appears early in life. Current treatment options for neurometabolic disorders are represented mainly by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) which do not sufficiently address clinical manifestations and leave patients with a substantial residual disease burden. Given this unmet medical need, alternative strategies based on genetic manipulation of patient's cells have been developed. Hematopoietic stem progenitor cells-gene therapy (HSPC-GT) entails the harvest autologous HSPCs which are ex-vivo manipulated by means of viral vectors to express the therapeutic gene and infused back into the patient after chemotherapy-based preparation. Modified HSPCs engraft and differentiate into the various hematopoietic cell lineages, producing the functional enzyme at either normal or supranormal levels. The number of clinical trials with HSPC-GT in neurometabolic disorders is rapidly increasing and some HSPC-GT products have recently received market approval.

However, it is only within the past decade that our understanding of CVNs has rapidly progressed. Driven by technological advances in neuroscience, novel findings are revealing genetic markers of CVN's subpopulation in the nucleus ambiguus (CVN<sup>NA</sup>), resolving controversial roles of CVN in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (CVN<sup>DMV</sup>), and dissecting the complexity of CVN-related neural circuitry. The roles of CVNs have also expanded in the mechanisms of disease pathophysiology beyond the typical autonomic disorders, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting CVNs. In this review, we discuss recent advances in CVNs subtypes, neural circuits, and roles in cardiometabolic disease and mental health-related disorders pathophysiology.

40570334,Aotearoa New Zealand cochlear implant programmes equity audit: addressing disparities and equity for Māori with severe and profound hearing loss.,"We examined equity in the provision of cochlear implant services for New Zealand Māori compared with other New Zealanders. The client databases of both Aotearoa New Zealand cochlear implant programmes were searched and an anonymised dataset was provided to the audit team. Ethics committee approval was not required. Ethnicity was categorised as Māori or non-Māori. There is no significant difference between Māori and non-Māori with respect to acceptance for surgery rates and time from acceptance to surgery. Māori children and adults have a higher rate of proceeding to surgery than non-Māori ethnic groups. Average days to surgery for adult clients reduced over the period studied. Time to surgery was low for both child ethnic groups. When a measure of prioritisation (clinical priority access criteria [CPAC]) was incorporated into the evaluation, we found that Māori clients waited slightly, but not significantly less time per unit of CPAC scored. We were able to demonstrate that once Māori clients accessed the cochlear implant programmes, they were implanted at a similar rate as non-Māori, and adult clients experienced equivalent waiting times even when adjusted for CPAC score.

40570329,"Efficacy of Solifenacin, Mirabegron, and Combination Therapy in Children With Daytime Urinary Incontinence (BeDry): Protocol for a Randomized Single-Blinded Controlled Trial.","According to International Children's Continence Society, the first-line treatment of children with daytime urinary incontinence is standard urotherapy, eventually followed by pharmacotherapy of anticholinergics. The effect of medical treatment is sparsely investigated and has been investigated primarily in nonrandomized trials. The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate if (1) combination therapy of solifenacin and mirabegron in low doses is superior to monotherapy of solifenacin in high dose and if (2) combination therapy of mirabegron and solifenacin in low doses is superior to monotherapy of mirabegron in high dose in the treatment of daytime urinary incontinence among children aged 5-14 years who are noncomplete responders to monotherapy of solifenacin in low dose or monotherapy of mirabegron in low dose. The secondary objective is to evaluate the treatment response of combination therapy of solifenacin and mirabegron in low doses, monotherapy in high doses, and monotherapy in low doses as supplementary comparisons. Additionally, the secondary objective is to evaluate the side effects, safety, and tolerability of the medical treatment as well as the effect of the treatment on the well-being and quality of life. Children aged 5-14 years diagnosed with daytime urinary incontinence refractory to standard urotherapy will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to 4 treatment groups. Initially, 2 groups will receive solifenacin 5 mg and 2 groups will receive mirabegron 25 mg. After 6 weeks, noncomplete responders will receive add-on treatments according to their primary randomization group. Group 1A will receive solifenacin 5 mg and add-on solifenacin 5 mg, group 1B will receive solifenacin 5 mg and add-on mirabegron 25 mg, group 2A will receive mirabegron 25 mg and add-on mirabegron 25 mg, and group 2B will receive mirabegron 25 mg and add-on solifenacin 5 mg. The total treatment period will be 18 weeks. The primary end point measure is treatment response assessed by change from visit 2 to the end of the study, according to the number of wet days per 7 days by DryPie. The BeDry study was approved by Clinical Trials in the European Union on June 12, 2024. Recruitment began on June 27, 2024, and will continue until 236 patients are included, which is expected to occur by September 2026. As of April 2025, 75 participants are included.

40570291,Risk prediction for major postoperative complications in people with chronic spinal cord injury/disorder and stage III and IV pressure injury.,"Approximately 20% of flap surgeries in people with spinal cord injury/disorder and stage III and IV pressure injury result in a major complication requiring re-surgery. Although several factors are associated with postoperative complications according to the literature, there is no risk prediction model for major postoperative complications in the treatment of stage III and IV pressure injuries in people with spinal cord injury/disorder. The study aims to predict the risk of major postoperative complications in people with spinal cord injury/disorder and stage III and IV pressure injury at hospital admission. The study was conducted in a Swiss acute and rehabilitation hospital for people with spinal cord injury/disorder that specialises in the treatment of people with spinal cord injury/disorder using the Basel Decubitus Approach. We performed a retrospective cohort study based on routinely collected clinical data in a Swiss hospital. Risk predictors for major postoperative complications during hospitalisation in pressure injuries over the sacrum/coccyx, ischium or trochanter between 01/2016 and 12/2022 were identified using a mixed effects logistic Bayesian LASSO analysis. We included 252 treatment procedures in 167 individuals. Major complications occurred in 48 (19%) treatment procedures. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) according to the cystatin formula (odds ratio [OR] 0.91, confidence interval [CI] 0.62-1.02), vitamin D (25-hydroxy vitamin D; OR 1.05, CI 0.98-1.23), vitamin B12 (OR 0.91, CI 0.74-1.05), sodium (OR 0.75, CI 0.16-1.05) and C-reactive protein (CRP; OR 0.98, CI 0.79-1.07) were found to be predictive of major complications at hospital admission.

40570276,General vs Nongeneral Anesthesia for Endovascular Thrombectomy in Patients With Large Core Strokes: A Prespecified Secondary Analysis of SELECT2 Trial.,"The association of anesthesia approach during endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) with clinical outcomes in large strokes is unexplored. We aimed to evaluate whether general anesthesia (GA), compared with non-GA, was associated with better functional outcomes in the SELECT2 trial. In a prespecified secondary analysis of the SELECT2 trial that enrolled patients with large strokes on noncontrast CT (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score [ASPECTS] 3-5), CT perfusion/MRI (core volume ≥50 mL), or both, functional outcomes were compared in EVT-treated patients who received GA or non-GA and whether this association was modified by stroke severity (NIH Stroke Scale score), ischemic injury estimates, and collateral status was evaluated. The primary outcome was 90-day functional status (ordinal modified Rankin Scale [mRS]). Secondary outcomes were functional independence (mRS scores 0-2), independent ambulation (mRS scores 0-3), complete dependence or death (mRS scores 5-6), and mortality. Of 178 EVT patients (median [interquartile range] age 66 [58-75] years, stroke severity 19 [15-23], CT-ASPECTS 4 [3-5], and core volume 101.5 [70-138] mL, 71 women [39.9%]), 104 (58%) received GA. Time from randomization to arterial puncture was longer with GA (40 [23-59] minutes) vs non-GA (27 [18-47] minutes), but procedural duration (GA: 57 [31.5-77] minutes vs non-GA: 49.5 [30-71] minutes) was similar. Successful reperfusion (modified treatment in cerebral infarction [mTICI] score 2b-3) rates were similar (GA 81 (78%) vs non-GA 62 (84%), adjusted relative risk [aRR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.79-1.06). In addition, mRS distribution did not differ between GA and non-GA groups (adjusted generalized odds ratio 1.21, 95% CI 0.86-1.70), as well as independent ambulation (GA: 41% vs non-GA: 34%, aRR 1.22, 95% CI 0.86-1.74) and functional independence (GA: 22% vs non-GA: 18%, aRR 1.32, 95% CI 0.75-2.35). Stroke severity, ASPECTS, ischemic core volume, or collaterals did not modify the association between anesthesia and functional outcome (all <i>p</i>-interaction >0.05). Patients experienced systolic blood pressure (SBP) variability ≥40 mm Hg and minimum intraprocedural SBP (<100 mm Hg) more frequently with GA, but this did not modify GA association with functional outcomes (<i>p</i>-interaction = 0.77 and 0.89, respectively). In patients with large core strokes randomized in SELECT2, EVT outcomes did not differ significantly based on anesthesia approach (GA or non-GA) without heterogeneity across stroke severity and size. While GA was associated with higher SBP variability and lower minimum SBP, this did not modify GA association with functional outcomes. While allocation to anesthesia approach was nonrandomized, our findings suggest that optimizing institutional protocols for preferred anesthesia technique, whether GA or non-GA, may enhance EVT procedural outcomes.

40570275,Better Communication With the Public: Understanding Science Phobia and Mistrust as Neurobiological Phenomena.,"Much has been written recently about science mistrust and illiteracy and consequent phobia of recommendations and interventions that have grown out of that science. Both reinforcing and reversing these phenomena depend on strategies aimed at brain networks that generate them. The neurogenesis of specific phobias involves a network that includes the amygdala and the hypothalamus and their connection through the stria terminalis. Decreased GABAergic inhibition of this circuit results in limbic activation and induction of fear pathways. The neurogenesis of mistrust involves suppression of a network that includes the central amygdala and the shell of the nucleus accumbens, both of which are rich in oxytocin receptors and yield dopaminergic output. Oxytocin signaling mediates trust, whereas, at least in men, dihydrotestosterone signaling mediates mistrust. The possibility of involvement of these limbic circuits in both science phobia and mistrust may underlie the high efficacy of emotionally focused communication in reinforcing them. Yet, recent efforts to reverse science phobia and mistrust have more often involved intellectually focused communication. Assuming limbic network origins of science phobia and mistrust, this commentary presents and discusses the use of emotionally focused communication and explicit, public identification of manipulative techniques and innuendo to influence the prevalence of these phenomena.",Neurology,2025.0,Nina F Schor,write recently science mistrust illiteracy consequent phobia recommendation intervention grow science reinforce reverse phenomenon depend strategy aim brain network generate neurogenesis specific phobia involve network include amygdala hypothalamus connection stria terminalis decrease gabaergic inhibition circuit result limbic activation induction fear pathway neurogenesis mistrust involve suppression network include central amygdala shell nucleus accumben rich oxytocin receptor yield dopaminergic output oxytocin signal mediate trust man dihydrotestosterone signal mediate mistrust possibility involvement limbic circuit science phobia mistrust underlie high efficacy emotionally focus communication reinforce recent effort reverse science phobia mistrust involve intellectually focused communication assume limbic network origin science phobia mistrust commentary present discuss use emotionally focused communication explicit public identification manipulative technique innuendo influence prevalence phenomenon
40570274,Phenotypic Spectrum in Individuals With Pathogenic <i>GABRG2</i> Loss- and Gain-of-Function Variants.,"Variants in the <i>GABRG2</i> gene encoding the γ2 subunit of the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptor are associated with a spectrum of epilepsy phenotypes. These range from simple febrile seizures to more severe conditions, including developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs). Despite previous analyses suggesting that pathogenic variants may lead to loss-of-function (LoF) receptors, a correlation between functional analysis and clinical phenotypic diversity remains elusive. We, therefore, aimed to determine why variants in the <i>GABRG2</i> gene can lead to highly diverse phenotypes. We assembled a cohort of unreported probands carrying presumed pathogenic <i>GABRG2</i> variants. Electroclinical information was systematically collected, and electrophysiologic measurements were conducted for missense variants to explore potential alterations in receptor function. We examined 44 individuals with 35 <i>GABRG2</i> variants (18 null and 17 missense). Functional assessments of the missense variants revealed that 9 caused LoF and 3 caused gain-of-function (GoF). The remaining 5 did not alter receptor function and are likely not pathogenic. Based on functional analysis and electroclinical data, 37 affected individuals were categorized into 3 groups: null LoF, missense LoF, and GoF variants. Among 19 individuals with null variants, epilepsy was diagnosed in 13, with a median onset of 14 months. The remaining 6 of 19 only had febrile seizures. Developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID) was observed in 1 of 19 and psychiatric features in 4 of 18. By contrast, all 12 individuals with missense LoF variants suffered from epilepsy with a median onset of 15 months. Most common epilepsy diagnoses were febrile seizures plus in 4 of 12 and DEE in 4 of 12. DD/ID affected 9 of 12, and psychiatric features were diagnosed in 8 of 12. Statistical comparisons revealed that null variants were associated with a milder phenotype than missense LoF variants. Finally, 5 of 6 individuals with GoF variants had DEE characterized by early infancy onset at 2 months and severe/profound DD/ID. The sixth individual exhibited mild DD/ID and hypotonia without seizures.

40570273,Intracranial Nonstenosing Atherosclerotic Plaques Assessed With Vessel Wall MRI in Patients With Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source.,"Artery-to-artery embolization from vulnerable intracranial nonstenosing atherosclerotic plaques (vNSPs) has been proposed as a major contributor to embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). Vessel wall MRI (VWMRI) offers the potential to identify culprit vNSPs, yet prospective studies in ESUS populations are lacking. This study aimed to assess the role of vNSPs in single-territory ESUS and to evaluate the utility of intracranial VWMRI in the diagnostic workup. Consecutive patients admitted to the Stroke Unit of the IRCCS Mondino Foundation (Pavia, Italy) with a confirmed ESUS diagnosis after a complete etiologic workup were prospectively enrolled in the study. Patients with multiterritorial ischemic lesions, complicated aortic arch atherosclerosis, or a probable patent foramen ovale-associated stroke were excluded. Intracranial VWMRI at 3-T was performed within 1 month of the index event. Atherosclerotic lesions were considered culprit if demonstrating postcontrast enhancement on T1-weighted images and a location consistent with ischemic lesions' distribution. Quantitative radiologic features of vNSPs were also analyzed. A total of 80 patients (mean age 65.6 years, 34 [42.5%] women) were included. VWMRI identified a potentially culprit vNSP in 23 of 80 patients (28.8%, 95% CI 20-39.5). Patients with symptomatic vNSPs were older (72.7 vs 62.8 years, <i>p</i> = 0.002) and more frequently current (43.5 vs 35.1%) or former (30.4 vs 8.8%) smokers (<i>p</i> = 0.014). In a multivariable logistic regression model including major risk factors of intracranial atherosclerosis (age, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia), both age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.12, 95% CI 1.05-1.22, <i>p</i> = 0.002) and smoking status (active smokers: aOR 7.99, 95% CI 1.81-47.8, <i>p</i> = 0.011; former smokers: aOR 8.79, 95% CI 1.73-55.0, <i>p</i> = 0.012) were significantly associated with symptomatic vNSP. Intracranial vNSPs may represent a significant underlying cause of single-territory ESUS, and VWMRI could provide an added value in the diagnostic workup of these patients. Older age and smoking exposure were found to be independently associated with the presence of culprit intracranial vNSPs. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings because of the relatively small and monocentric cohort.

40570271,Rapid Diagnosis of Intracerebral Hemorrhage in Patients With Acute Stroke by Measuring Prehospital GFAP Levels on a Point-of-Care Device (DETECT).,"The rapid identification of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in patients with symptoms of acute stroke is decisive for prehospital triage and initiation of targeted therapies. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a highly promising blood-biomarker indicating ICH. In this study, we investigated the potential of a new GFAP test run on a point-of-care platform for distinguishing ICH from ischemic stroke (IS) and stroke mimics (SM) in the prehospital phase. This prospective diagnostic accuracy study was conducted at the RKH Klinikum Ludwigsburg, a tertiary care hospital in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Patients with symptoms of acute stroke admitted within 6 hours of symptom onset were enrolled. Blood samples were collected in the prehospital phase. Plasma GFAP measurements were performed on the i-STAT-Alinity device (duration: 15 minutes) in-hospital. The gold standard was the final diagnosis categorized ICH, IS, or SM. A total of 353 patients were enrolled (mean age 74.6 ± 13.4 years; 46.7% female). GFAP concentrations were elevated in patients with ICH (n = 76; median 208 pg/mL [interquartile range 60-5,907]) compared with IS (n = 258; 30 pg/mL [29-51]) and SM (n = 19; 48 pg/mL [29-97]; <i>p</i> < 0.001). The optimal GFAP cutoff point to differentiate ICH from IS and SM was 55 pg/mL (area under the curve of 0.880, 95% CI 0.834-0.925, <i>p</i> < 0.001). IS and SM GFAP levels slightly increased in parallel with increasing age. Hence, different GFAP cutoff points were determined to identify ICH across 3 age groups with moderate to high positive predictive values (PPVs) (90.0%-95.5%; minimum lower CI 55.0%, maximum upper CI 99.3%) (sensitivity values 56.3%-72.4%, specificity values 98.9%-99.0% and negative predictive values [NPVs] 87.5%-92.7%). Vice versa, in patients with a moderate to severe neurologic deficit (NIH Stroke Scale >6), GFAP values <30 pg/mL ruled out ICH with a NPV of 100.0%. Laboratory GFAP measurements on a point-of-care platform in blood samples collected from patients with symptoms of acute stroke in the prehospital phase can help to identify ICH with moderate to high PPV. Following confirmation in larger independent cohorts using optimized eligibility criteria and validated age-specific cutoff values, GFAP testing could facilitate optimized triage and the initiation of blood pressure-lowering therapy and anticoagulation reversal in earlier time frames. This study provides Class II evidence that elevated plasma GFAP levels within 6 hours of symptom onset accurately distinguish patients with ICH from IS and SM.",Neurology,2025.0,Love-Preet Kalra; Sabina Zylyftari; Kristaps Blums; Stephan Barthelmes; Hannsjoerg Baum; Stephan Meckel; Andreas Heilgeist; Sebastian Luger; Christian Foerch,"rapid identification intracerebral hemorrhage ich patient symptom acute stroke decisive prehospital triage initiation target therapy glial fibrillary acidic protein gfap highly promising blood biomarker indicate ich study investigate potential new gfap test run point care platform distinguish ich ischemic stroke stroke mimic sm prehospital phase prospective diagnostic accuracy study conduct rkh klinikum ludwigsburg tertiary care hospital baden württemberg germany patient symptom acute stroke admit 6 hour symptom onset enrol blood sample collect prehospital phase plasma gfap measurement perform stat alinity device duration 15 minute hospital gold standard final diagnosis categorize ich sm total 353 patient enrol mean age 74.6 ± 13.4 year 46.7 female gfap concentration elevate patient ich n = 76 median 208 pg ml interquartile range 60 5,907 compare n = 258 30 pg ml 29 51 sm n = 19 48 pg ml 29 97 < > p</i > < 0.001 optimal gfap cutoff point differentiate ich sm 55 pg ml area curve 0.880 95 ci 0.834 0.925 < > p</i > < 0.001 sm gfap level slightly increase parallel increase age different gfap cutoff point determined identify ich 3 age group moderate high positive predictive value ppvs 90.0%-95.5 minimum low ci 55.0 maximum upper ci 99.3 sensitivity value 56.3%-72.4 specificity value 98.9%-99.0 negative predictive value npvs 87.5%-92.7 vice versa patient moderate severe neurologic deficit nih stroke scale > 6 gfap value < 30 pg ml rule ich npv 100.0 laboratory gfap measurement point care platform blood sample collect patient symptom acute stroke prehospital phase help identify ich moderate high ppv follow confirmation large independent cohort optimize eligibility criterion validate age specific cutoff value gfap testing facilitate optimize triage initiation blood pressure lower therapy anticoagulation reversal early time frame study provide class ii evidence elevate plasma gfap level 6 hour symptom onset accurately distinguish patient ich sm"

40570259,"Minimum Technical Preanalytical, Patient, and Clinical Context Data Elements for Cerebrospinal Fluid Liquid Biopsy: Recommendations for Public Database Submissions.","Blood-based liquid biopsy has enabled minimally invasive molecular profiling in patients with solid tumors. For cancers of the CNS, however, the use of peripheral blood for cell-free DNA (cfDNA) detection and sequencing has proved challenging because of scant levels of tumor-derived material shed into systemic circulation. An alternative is to use cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which contains a greater concentration of tumor-derived cfDNA in patients with brain tumors (BTs). CSF liquid biopsy is a relatively nascent field, with critical unanswered questions regarding preanalytical variables that may affect assay performance. In an effort to identify and standardize key preanalytical variables, the Blood Profiling Atlas in Cancer (BLOODPAC) Consortium launched a BT Working Group in 2022. We reviewed protocols for CSF sample collection and processing used by expert Working Group members at their respective academic institutions and diagnostic companies, as well as the available literature on CSF liquid biopsy. Through a collaborative and iterative process, we developed a list of key preanalytical variables for cfDNA-based CSF liquid biopsy in patients with primary and metastatic brain malignancies. The Working Group agreed on a recommended list of preanalytical minimum technical data elements, clinical context data elements, and patient context data elements for cfDNA-based CSF liquid biopsy in patients with CNS malignancies. A subset of variables were considered to be of critical priority and are designated as required annotations to submissions of cfDNA-based CSF liquid biopsy sample data into the BLOODPAC Data Commons.

40570248,Registry-based surveillance of paediatric home respiratory support in Switzerland: methodology and initial findings.,"The use of long-term home respiratory support in children has increased dramatically worldwide in recent decades. However, no national data are available in Switzerland since the last survey in 2001. In 2022, the national prospective Swiss Paediatric Home Respiratory Support (SwissPedHRS) registry was created on behalf of the Swiss Society of Paediatric Pulmonology, involving all centres caring for children with home respiratory support. Its main goal is to prospectively describe and study the population of children requiring home respiratory support in Switzerland. This first publication aims to present the SwissPedHRS methodology and describe the current paediatric population with home respiratory support in Switzerland and its evolution from 2001 to 2023. Inclusion criteria in the registry are age <18 years, use of home respiratory support for ≥3 months and follow-up in Switzerland. The seven paediatric centres caring for patients with long-term home respiratory support in Switzerland participated, asking all their patients who met the criteria to participate. Each centre designated a local person to enter data collected from medical files into a dedicated database. Inclusions began in April 2022. Data from all patients included during the first year of the registry (i.e. until March 2023) were extracted, and the following data were analysed: sex; age at inclusion; underlying pathology; age, place, and context of home respiratory support initiation; decisive test leading to home respiratory support initiation; breathing disorder mechanism; and type of home respiratory support. The registry included 146 patients, and the prevalence of children with home respiratory support in Switzerland was estimated at 11.9/100,000 children (59% boys, 41% girls). The most common underlying medical conditions were related to neuro-muscular (38%) and central nervous system (25%) diseases. The home respiratory support type was bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) for 67% of patients, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for 32%, and high flow nasal cannula for 1%. Respiratory support was delivered invasively (via tracheostomy) for 14%. The median age at home respiratory support initiation was 6.6 years. Home respiratory support was initiated electively in 68% of patients and in acute situations (weaning failure after an acute respiratory exacerbation, neonatal hospitalisation, or surgery) in 32%. The place of initiation was either an outpatient clinic (19%), standard care unit (15%) or intensive/intermediate care unit (66%). SwissPedHRS is the first national prospective registry dedicated to children with home respiratory support. It is a valuable resource for improving knowledge and, therefore, the management of children with home respiratory support. Analysis of the first year's data in the SwissPedHRS registry showed a sixfold increase in prevalence since 2001. It also highlighted a larger spectrum of underlying medical conditions and types of sleep-disordered breathing leading to home respiratory support and important changes in home respiratory support modalities, with decreased invasive and increased non-invasive respiratory support and decreased BPAP and increased CPAP ventilation.",Swiss medical weekly,2025.0,Sophie Guerin; Christian Bieli; Regula Corbelli; Thomas Ferry; Miriam Giaranna; Matthias Horn; Silvia Miano; Nicolas Regamey; Daniel Trachsel; Sylvain Blanchon,"use long term home respiratory support child increase dramatically worldwide recent decade national datum available switzerland survey 2001 2022 national prospective swiss paediatric home respiratory support swisspedhrs registry create behalf swiss society paediatric pulmonology involve centre care child home respiratory support main goal prospectively describe study population child require home respiratory support switzerland publication aim present swisspedhrs methodology describe current paediatric population home respiratory support switzerland evolution 2001 2023 inclusion criterion registry age < 18 year use home respiratory support ≥3 month follow switzerland seven paediatric centre care patient long term home respiratory support switzerland participate ask patient meet criterion participate centre designate local person enter datum collect medical file dedicated database inclusion begin april 2022 datum patient include year registry i.e. march 2023 extract follow datum analyse sex age inclusion underlie pathology age place context home respiratory support initiation decisive test lead home respiratory support initiation breathe disorder mechanism type home respiratory support registry include 146 patient prevalence child home respiratory support switzerland estimate 11.9/100,000 child 59 boy 41 girl common underlying medical condition relate neuro muscular 38 central nervous system 25 disease home respiratory support type bilevel positive airway pressure bpap 67 patient continuous positive airway pressure cpap 32 high flow nasal cannula 1 respiratory support deliver invasively tracheostomy 14 median age home respiratory support initiation 6.6 year home respiratory support initiate electively 68 patient acute situation wean failure acute respiratory exacerbation neonatal hospitalisation surgery 32 place initiation outpatient clinic 19 standard care unit 15 intensive intermediate care unit 66 swisspedhrs national prospective registry dedicate child home respiratory support valuable resource improve knowledge management child home respiratory support analysis year datum swisspedhrs registry show sixfold increase prevalence 2001 highlight large spectrum underlie medical condition type sleep disorder breathing lead home respiratory support important change home respiratory support modality decrease invasive increase non invasive respiratory support decrease bpap increase cpap ventilation"

40570217,[Influence of retroelements on the relationship between aging and neurodegenerative diseases.].,"During physiological aging, pathological activation of retroelements with accumulation and aggregation of beta-amyloid, tau, alpha-synuclein, and TDP-43 proteins is observed in the brain, which may be the cause of progressive decline in cognitive abilities with age. In neurodegenerative diseases, these processes are enhanced by hereditary predisposition (disease-associated polymorphisms are localized mainly in intronic and intergenic regions where retroelements are located) and specific viral infections. This leads to hyperactivation of retroelements, which is reflected in changes in epigenetic factors involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, since the same viruses that cause activation and aggregation of beta-amyloid, tau, alpha-synuclein and TDP-43 stimulate transcription of retroelements. The resulting aggregates cause derepression of retroelements, since these proteins normally inhibit transcription of retroelements. The listed processes occur at the epigenetic level, since they do not affect DNA sequences, and the key participants are retroelements, which are drivers of epigenetic regulation. Therefore, for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, it may be promising to develop therapeutic interventions aimed at the activity of retroelements, which has already shown its effectiveness in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, in which persistent inflammation and demyelination processes lead to the onset of neurodegeneration with proven involvement of retroelements in the pathogenesis.",Advances in gerontology = Uspekhi gerontologii,2025.0,R N Mustafin,physiological aging pathological activation retroelement accumulation aggregation beta amyloid tau alpha synuclein tdp-43 protein observe brain cause progressive decline cognitive ability age neurodegenerative disease process enhance hereditary predisposition disease associate polymorphism localize mainly intronic intergenic region retroelement locate specific viral infection lead hyperactivation retroelement reflect change epigenetic factor involve pathogenesis neurodegenerative disease virus cause activation aggregation beta amyloid tau alpha synuclein tdp-43 stimulate transcription retroelement result aggregate cause derepression retroelement protein normally inhibit transcription retroelement list process occur epigenetic level affect dna sequence key participant retroelement driver epigenetic regulation treatment neurodegenerative disease promise develop therapeutic intervention aim activity retroelement show effectiveness treatment multiple sclerosis autoimmune disease central nervous system persistent inflammation demyelination process lead onset neurodegeneration proven involvement retroelement pathogenesis

They were classified as data-based or non-data-based and categorised by design, population, and mental health outcomes. The analysis identified 662 publications, revealing two distinct phases: a stagnation phase (2005-2011) with minimal output, and a productive phase (2012-2024), with 23% published between 2012-2019 and 77% between 2020-2024. Five thematic clusters were uncovered: public health and epidemiology, addiction and substance use, mental health and co-occurring disorders, social/environmental influences, and psychological distress in academic settings. Cross-sectional studies dominated the field, with adolescents and young adults being the primary populations. Depression and addiction were the most frequently studied topics, with an increasing focus on severe conditions like suicidality. Research remains concentrated in high-income countries, particularly the USA, with Addictive Behaviors and Nicotine and Tobacco Research leading in publication volume. Our review underscores the need for continued research into the underexplored yet critical intersection of vaping and mental health. Understanding this complex relationship is vital for developing effective prevention and intervention strategies. This study offers the first bibliometric analysis of vaping and mental health research, revealing a shift from stagnation (2005-2011) to rapid growth (2012-2024) due to rising public health concerns. It identifies five key research clusters-public health, addiction, co-occurring mental health issues, social and environmental influences, and psychological distress-highlighting a focus on adolescents and young adults and an inclination towards cross-sectional designs.

40570189,Role of LRRK2 in axonal transport and Parkinson's disease.,"Axonal transport is crucial for neuronal health and function, facilitating the delivery of newly synthesized material from the soma via anterograde transport and the removal of aged proteins and damaged organelles for degradation via retrograde transport. Emerging evidence links Parkinson's disease (PD)-causing mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene to dysfunctional axonal transport. Pathogenic LRRK2 mutations induce increased LRRK2 kinase activity, leading to the hyperphosphorylation of RAB proteins, which are key regulators of intracellular trafficking and transport. Here, we review the current literature on how LRRK2 affects the axonal transport of different cargoes, focusing on synaptic vesicle precursors, mitochondria, and autophagosomes. We further discuss how LRRK2 influences cytoskeletal dynamics and how it affects vesicle trafficking at the Golgi, which may indirectly contribute to its effect on axonal transport. This review summarizes our current understanding of how pathogenic LRRK2 hyperactivation disrupts axonal transport and how this may be linked to the neurodegeneration of PD.",The Biochemical journal,2025.0,Björn Twellsieck; C Alexander Boecker,axonal transport crucial neuronal health function facilitate delivery newly synthesize material soma anterograde transport removal aged protein damage organelle degradation retrograde transport emerge evidence link parkinson disease pd)-causing mutation leucine rich repeat kinase 2 lrrk2 gene dysfunctional axonal transport pathogenic lrrk2 mutation induce increase lrrk2 kinase activity lead hyperphosphorylation rab protein key regulator intracellular trafficking transport review current literature lrrk2 affect axonal transport different cargo focus synaptic vesicle precursor mitochondria autophagosome discuss lrrk2 influence cytoskeletal dynamic affect vesicle trafficking golgi indirectly contribute effect axonal transport review summarize current understanding pathogenic lrrk2 hyperactivation disrupt axonal transport link neurodegeneration pd
40570164,"The Effect of a Remote Network Technology Supervised Exercise Program Combined With Drug Treatment for Fibromyalgia: Randomized, Single-Blind, Controlled Trial.","Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic musculoskeletal pain disorder that is seldom reported in China. Recent studies have focused on nondrug treatments, particularly physical therapy, as an alternative to treatments using medication. With the rise of smartphones and mobile communication, mobile health technology has become a significant area of study. This study aims to explore whether using remote network applications to supervise patient exercise, in combination with medication, can improve FM pain. It builds on previous research that focuses on drug treatments and offers insights into individualized exercise therapy for FM.  The study used a prospective, randomized controlled design with 80 participants, who were divided into 2 groups: supervised and unsupervised. Both groups received a drug regimen: oral pregabalin (75-150 mg twice daily) and duloxetine (30-60 mg once daily). The supervised group followed exercise routines with guidance from web-based rehabilitation therapist via a remote network application, while the unsupervised group exercised without supervision. The study was blinded to the participants. Primary outcomes were pain levels over the past 24 hours as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Secondary outcomes included pain relief, sleep improvement, quality of life, and adverse event occurrences. Observations were made at the start of treatment (T0), 1 month after treatment (T1), and 3 months after treatment (T3). We recruited 80 participants, evenly divided into 2 groups, from August 2022 to December 2023 at West China Hospital of Sichuan University. Comparisons of the 2 groups were performed using analysis of variance and Bonferroni post hoc analyses (SPSS version 25 for Windows, P<.05 considered as significant). Compared with T0, the Widespread Pain Index (WPI), symptom severity score (SSS), and BPI (pain on average, least pain in past 24 h, pain right now) scores of the 2 groups of patients with fibromyalgia at T1 were significantly lower. Compared with T0, the WPI, SSS, BPI (pain on average, worst pain in past 24 h, least pain in past 24 h, pain right now), and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire scores of the 2 groups of patients at T3 were significantly lower. The WPI, SSS, BPI (pain on average, worst pain in past 24 h, pain right now), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores of the 2 groups at T3 were significantly lower than at T1. However, the significance of some of the data did not exist after Bonferroni correction. The changes in scores from T0 to T1 (T1-T0), from T0 to T3 (T3-T0), and from T1 to T3 (T3-T1) in the supervised group were all less statistically significant compared to the unsupervised group. The study showed that exercise combined with drug therapy can significantly improve the prognosis of FM, including pain relief, better sleep, and better overall quality of life; long-term supervised exercise training is more effective in improving FM symptoms and is safer and more reliable than unsupervised exercise.",Journal of medical Internet research,2025.0,Cuomaoji Zhang; Peijun Zhang; Yuanmeng Zhao; Yuntao Liu; Yun Hu; Zihan Zhu; Hong Xiao,fibromyalgia fm chronic musculoskeletal pain disorder seldom report china recent study focus nondrug treatment particularly physical therapy alternative treatment medication rise smartphone mobile communication mobile health technology significant area study study aim explore remote network application supervise patient exercise combination medication improve fm pain build previous research focus drug treatment offer insight individualized exercise therapy fm study prospective randomize control design 80 participant divide 2 group supervise unsupervised group receive drug regiman oral pregabalin 75 150 mg twice daily duloxetine 30 60 mg daily supervised group follow exercise routine guidance web base rehabilitation therapist remote network application unsupervised group exercise supervision study blind participant primary outcome pain level past 24 hour measure brief pain inventory bpi secondary outcome include pain relief sleep improvement quality life adverse event occurrence observation start treatment t0 1 month treatment t1 3 month treatment t3 recruit 80 participant evenly divide 2 group august 2022 december 2023 west china hospital sichuan university comparison 2 group perform analysis variance bonferroni post hoc analysis spss version 25 windows p<.05 consider significant compare t0 widespread pain index wpi symptom severity score sss bpi pain average pain past 24 h pain right score 2 group patient fibromyalgia t1 significantly low compare t0 wpi sss bpi pain average bad pain past 24 h pain past 24 h pain right fibromyalgia impact questionnaire score 2 group patient t3 significantly low wpi sss bpi pain average bad pain past 24 h pain right pittsburgh sleep quality index score 2 group t3 significantly low t1 significance datum exist bonferroni correction change score t0 t1 t1 t0 t0 t3 t3 t0 t1 t3 t3 t1 supervised group statistically significant compare unsupervised group study show exercise combine drug therapy significantly improve prognosis fm include pain relief well sleep well overall quality life long term supervise exercise training effective improve fm symptom safe reliable unsupervised exercise
40570092,Understanding adolescent psychotherapy utilization in India: A mixed methods tertiary care center study.,"BackgroundIndia faces a substantial mental health treatment gap, particularly regarding the underutilization of psychotherapy among adolescents. This mixed-methods study aimed to identify the barriers and facilitators influencing the uptake of psychotherapy for mental health issues among adolescents attending a tertiary care referral center in India.MethodsA mixed-methods design was employed. Quantitative data were collected from 74 adolescents recruited via purposive sampling using standardized scales assessing attitudes toward seeking professional psychological treatment, self-stigma, perceived barriers to seeking help, and the working alliance. Qualitative data were gathered through focus group discussions to further explore barriers and facilitators of psychotherapy.ResultsMost participants were diagnosed with neurotic spectrum disorders and had no prior psychotherapy experience. Higher self-stigma and perceived barriers were associated with less favorable attitudes toward seeking psychotherapy, while a stronger working alliance was associated with more positive attitudes. Thematic analysis identified key barriers including stigma, apprehension, poor awareness, negative social influences, and reliance on informal support. Facilitators included greater mental health literacy, perceived symptom severity, and encouragement from informal networks. Urban adolescents reported stronger working alliances compared to their rural counterparts.ConclusionFindings highlight the need to address stigma, enhance mental health literacy, and consider contextual factors in service delivery.",Clinical child psychology and psychiatry,2025.0,Himshikha Sharma; Prerna Sharma,backgroundindia face substantial mental health treatment gap particularly underutilization psychotherapy adolescent mixed method study aim identify barrier facilitator influence uptake psychotherapy mental health issue adolescent attend tertiary care referral center india methodsa mix method design employ quantitative datum collect 74 adolescent recruit purposive sampling standardized scale assess attitude seek professional psychological treatment self stigma perceive barrier seek help work alliance qualitative datum gather focus group discussion explore barrier facilitator psychotherapy resultsmost participant diagnose neurotic spectrum disorder prior psychotherapy experience high self stigma perceive barrier associate favorable attitude seek psychotherapy strong working alliance associate positive attitude thematic analysis identify key barrier include stigma apprehension poor awareness negative social influence reliance informal support facilitator include great mental health literacy perceive symptom severity encouragement informal network urban adolescent report strong working alliance compare rural counterpart conclusionfinding highlight need address stigma enhance mental health literacy consider contextual factor service delivery
40570084,Turkish Version of the Video-Naming Test for Assessing Verb Anomia (DVAQ-30): Normative Data for the Adult Turkish Population and Validation Study in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Compared to nouns, the impairment of the capacity of retrieving verbs in spoken production is much less documented. In the clinical field, there are also very few tests that have been developed specifically for verb anomia. Clinicians and researchers lack a concise and practical naming test to assess verb anomia, a condition that can occur in adults and the elderly due to various factors. The aim of this study was to adapt the Quebec Action Video Naming Test-30 items (DVAQ-30) into Turkish, establish its validity and develop normative data adapted to the Turkish population. This research consists of three studies. In Study 1, the DVAQ-30 was linguistically and culturally adapted to the Turkish language, resulting in the DVAQ-TR. In Study 2, a group of adults and older Turkish-speaking people were assessed with the DVAQ-TR to obtain normative data. In Study 3, the psychometric properties of the DVAQ-TR (known-group discriminant validity and convergent validity) were investigated by comparing the performance of healthy individuals and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Normative data were obtained based on the performance of 424 participants aged between 18 and 81 years. The percentiles were stratified according to the sociodemographic influencing variables of age, sex and level of education. The DVAQ-TR had good convergent validity and distinguished the performance of healthy participants from that of participants with MCI or AD. The DVAQ-TR fills an important gap and has the capacity to assist clinicians and researchers in more accurately identifying acquired verb anomia, including in people with MCI or AD. What is already known on this subject Verb anomia is a frequent symptom in various neurocognitive disorders, yet it remains under-assessed in clinical settings, especially compared to noun naming. Existing tools in Turkish primarily focus on object naming and often rely on static images, which may not effectively capture action concepts. Recent studies suggest that video-based assessments provide a more ecologically valid approach to verb naming evaluation. What this study adds to existing knowledge This study presents the Turkish adaptation and validation of the DVAQ-30, a video-based verb naming test, offering culturally and linguistically appropriate normative data for Turkish-speaking adults and elderly individuals. It also demonstrates that the DVAQ-TR successfully differentiates between healthy controls and individuals with MCI or Alzheimer's disease and shows good convergent validity with the Boston Naming Test. These findings highlight the clinical utility of the DVAQ-TR in detecting verb anomia in Turkish-speaking populations. What are the clinical implications of this study? The DVAQ-TR provides clinicians with a quick, valid, and culturally sensitive tool for assessing verb anomia in adults with suspected neurocognitive impairments. It enhances diagnostic accuracy and may inform tailored language intervention strategies in individuals with MCI and Alzheimer's disease.

40570079,A novel dual-branch network for comprehensive spatiotemporal information integration for EEG-based epileptic seizure detection.,"Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures caused by abnormal brain activity, which can severely affects people's normal lives. To improve the lives of these patients, it is necessary to develop accurate methods to predict seizures. Electroencephalography (EEG), as a non-invasive and real-time technique, is crucial for the early diagnosis of epileptic seizures by monitoring abnormal brain activity associated with seizures. Deep learning EEG-based detection methods have made significant progress, but still face challenges such as the underutilization of spatial relationships, inter-individual physiological variability, and sequence intricacies. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Dual-Branch Deepwalk-Transformer Spatiotemporal Fusion Network (Deepwalk-TS), which effectively integrates spatiotemporal information from EEG signals to enable accurate and reliable epilepsy diagnosis. Specifically, the Spatio-branch introduces an adaptive multi-channel deepwalk-based graph framework for capturing intricate relationships within EEG channels. Furthermore, we develop a Guided-CNN Transformer branch to optimize the utilization of temporal sequence features. The novel dual-branch networks co-optimize features and achieve mutual gains through fusion strategies. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in multiple datasets, such as achieving 99.54% accuracy, 99.07% sensitivity and 98.87% specificity. This shows that the Deepwalk-TS model achieved accurate epilepsy detection while analyzing the spatiotemporal relationship between EEG and seizures. The method further offers an optimized solution for addressing health issues related to seizure diagnosis.",PloS one,2025.0,Xiaobing Deng,epilepsy neurological disorder characterize recurrent seizure cause abnormal brain activity severely affect people normal life improve life patient necessary develop accurate method predict seizure electroencephalography eeg non invasive real time technique crucial early diagnosis epileptic seizure monitor abnormal brain activity associate seizure deep learn eeg base detection method significant progress face challenge underutilization spatial relationship inter individual physiological variability sequence intricacy tackle challenge introduce dual branch deepwalk transformer spatiotemporal fusion network deepwalk ts effectively integrate spatiotemporal information eeg signal enable accurate reliable epilepsy diagnosis specifically spatio branch introduce adaptive multi channel deepwalk base graph framework capture intricate relationship eeg channel furthermore develop guided cnn transformer branch optimize utilization temporal sequence feature novel dual branch network co optimize feature achieve mutual gain fusion strategy result extensive experiment demonstrate method achieve state art performance multiple dataset achieve 99.54 accuracy 99.07 sensitivity 98.87 specificity show deepwalk ts model achieve accurate epilepsy detection analyze spatiotemporal relationship eeg seizure method offer optimize solution address health issue relate seizure diagnosis
40570073,The delayed effect of the neuroprotector fabomotizole on the brain proteome in rats with the rotenone model of parkinsonism.,"Fabomotizole is an original anxiolytic agent developed at the Federal Research Center for Innovator and Emerging Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Technologies that acts on a number of important receptor systems of the brain. In a model of Parkinson's disease induced in rats by a course of rotenone administration, fabomotizole attenuated manifestations of behavioral impairments and influenced the profile and relative content of brain proteins. Five days after the last administration of rotenone, the fabomotizole effect on the behavioral reactions of rats persisted. According to the proteomic study, the profile of brain proteins and changes in their relative content differed significantly from the results obtained immediately after the last administration of rotenone, as well as rotenone in combination with fabomotizole. Changes in the relative content of almost all proteins detected immediately after the last administration of rotenone or rotenone with fabomotizole were not detectable five days later. However, at this time point, there were changes in the relative content of other proteins associated with neurodegeneration in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.

40570038,Utility of PLUS CYCLE to measure physical activity and sleep duration and detect postoperative sleep disturbances in hospitalized dogs.,"Sleep is essential for animal health and welfare. In humans, postsurgical sleep disturbances can delay postoperative recovery. However, objective sleep evaluation in dogs and studies of postoperative sleep disturbances in animals have not been reported. This study aimed to determine whether activity monitors (PLUS CYCLE®; JARMeC, Kanagawa, Japan) can accurately monitor the condition of hospitalized dogs and postoperative sleep disturbances. First, the activity data collected by PLUS CYCLE® were compared with the observation data in a video of hospitalized dogs (n = 9). We determined the correlation between the total hours of physical activity, Sleeping/Resting time and amount of physical activity collected by PLUS CYCLE®, and the time when body movements could not be confirmed (inactive time) recorded by video. There was a strong correlation between the inactive time observed in the videos and the Sleeping/Resting time in PLUS CYCLE® (p < 0.0001, r = 0.95). Thereafter, six hospitalized dogs (n = 6) that underwent phacoemulsification and aspiration surgery for cataracts at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the Okayama University of Science were monitored to compare pre- and postoperative amounts of physical activity and Sleeping/Resting time between two groups: the Colorado State University Acute Pain Scale (APS) = 0 group (n = 3) and the APS = 1 group (n = 3). A significant decrease in postoperative sleep duration was observed in the APS = 1 group (p = 0.0224). This prospective study suggested that PLUS CYCLE® can accurately assess the condition of hospitalized dogs and that it has the potential to detect postoperative sleep disturbance.

40570029,Cost-utility of aripiprazole once-monthly versus paliperidone palmitate once-monthly injectable for schizophrenia in China.,"From the perspective of Chinese healthcare system, this study compared the cost-utility of aripiprazole once-monthly (AOM) and paliperidone palmitate once-monthly injectable (PP1M) in the treatment of adult patients with schizophrenia in China. A 5-state Markov model was developed to evaluate the cost-utility of 10 years of long-acting injections (LAI) treatment for schizophrenia. The long-term costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated, with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as the primary outcome. The annual discount rate was set at 5%. A cost-effectiveness threshold (CET) of 0.51 times China's 2023 gross domestic product (GDP) (US$ 6,394.536) was used to judge the economics of intervention. The current price of AOM in China is relatively high (US$418.140). To assess its cost-effectiveness in the context of potential price negotiations with China Healthcare Security Administration (CHS) for inclusion in the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL), we simulated a 40% price reduction (US$257.619). At a CET of 0.51 times GDP per capita (US$6,394.536), the base-case analysis showed that the incremental costs of AOM relative to PP1M after 10 years of treatment were US$1,926.373 with an incremental gain of 0.306 QALYs. The ICER for AOM was US$6,285.303 per QALY, which is below the CET, indicating that AOM is cost-effective. One-way sensitivity analysis identified AOM's drug cost as the parameter with the greatest impact on results. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that with a 40% price reduction, the probability of AOM being cost-effective is only 41.70%. However, with a 60% price reduction, AOM became dominantly cost-effective, with the probability increasing to 100%. When the CET was relaxed to 0.90 times GDP per capita (US$11,284.476), the probability of cost-effectiveness for AOM after a 40% price reduction rose to 85.10%. Scenario analyses conducted over a time horizon extending from 10 to 30 years showed that the ICER decreased significantly with longer follow-up, gradually approaching the 0.51GDP threshold and remaining below the 0.90 GDP threshold throughout the analysis. The cost-effectiveness of AOM relative to PP1M is highly influenced by its price and the CET.

This was part of the Rapid Assessment for Avoidable Blindness (RAAB), held in all provinces of Nepal from 2018 to 2021. Cataract blindness was defined as a person having the best-corrected vision, < 6/60 in the better eye, and an unoperated cataract, which was the principal cause of visual disability. The participants were interviewed using a pretested questionnaire with seven known barriers. The demographic information was correlated with the barrier score. We surveyed 718 cataract blind. Two-thirds of the participants were females. Four in ten were aged 50-59 years. The main barriers perceived were 'need is not felt' (237; 33%), cost associated with surgery (218; 30%), lack of access (93; 13%), fear of surgery (88; 12%), nobody to accompany (40; 6%), unaware of surgery (18; 3%), and treatment denied (24; 3%). The barriers were not significantly different in females than in males. (P = 0.85). The provincial variations of barriers were significant. (P < 0.001). High cost was a perceived barrier in all provinces except Gandaki. Access to treatment was a barrier in the Gandaki province (38%). One in four participants in the Madhesh and Bagmati provinces feared surgery. Nearly half of the cataract blind in the Madhesh and Lumbini province did not feel 'need for restoring vision'. To improve cataract surgery uptake, identified barriers, like lack of awareness, low visual need, and high cost must be addressed.

We examined the predictive validity of the ITC; and the association between positive ITC screening and health care utilization (HCU). Prospective cohort study of children at average-risk for developmental delay attending their 18-month visit in primary care in Toronto, Canada. Parents completed the ITC. HCU from the single-payer provincial health system was collected from health administrative databases ensuring complete follow-up. Physician billing code for a neurodevelopmental consultation was the primary outcome and criterion measure. Six other HCU types were assessed. Of 1460 children with a mean age at screening of 18 months, 11% screened ITC positive. Mean age at follow-up was 8 years, 2.6% had a neurodevelopmental consultation. Screening test properties (with neurodevelopmental consultation as the criterion measure): 40% sensitivity (95% CI 24%, 57%), 90% specificity (95% CI 88%, 91%), 10% false positive rate (95% CI 9%, 12%). Using multivariable negative binomial regression, a positive ITC was associated with higher rates of 6 of 7 HCU types, including neurodevelopmental consultation (aRR 2.78, 95% CI 1.37, 5.67, p = 0.005).

40569995,Knowledge and stigma of autism spectrum disorders in Chinese university students in the context of inclusive education.,"This study investigated knowledge of autism spectrum disorder and associated stigma among Chinese university students, utilizing the cross-culturally validated Chinese version of the Autism Stigma and Knowledge Questionnaire. A total of 2,081 students from 25 provinces participated in an online survey. Independent-samples t-tests and one-way ANOVAs revealed that female students, upper-grade students, normal-education students, special education majors, and those who had completed inclusive education courses demonstrated significantly higher levels of ASD knowledge and lower levels of stigma. Prior interactions with autistic people were also associated with greater understanding of ASD and more accepting attitudes. These findings emphasize the significance of incorporating autism-related content into both general and special education curricula, fostering high-quality interactions with autistic communities, and critically considering the types of knowledge that most effectively mitigate stigma. As inclusive education reforms progress in China, enhancing professional training and awareness of neurodiversity will be crucial for preparing future educators to establish inclusive and supportive learning environments.",PloS one,2025.0,Jinping Hu; Pengwei Fu; Shiying Qiao; Xinai Yan,"study investigate knowledge autism spectrum disorder associate stigma chinese university student utilize cross culturally validate chinese version autism stigma knowledge questionnaire total 2,081 student 25 province participate online survey independent sample t test way anova reveal female student upper grade student normal education student special education major complete inclusive education course demonstrate significantly high level asd knowledge low level stigma prior interaction autistic people associate great understanding asd accept attitude finding emphasize significance incorporate autism relate content general special education curricula foster high quality interaction autistic community critically consider type knowledge effectively mitigate stigma inclusive education reform progress china enhance professional training awareness neurodiversity crucial prepare future educator establish inclusive supportive learn environment"
40569992,A mixed methods exploration of motor imagery in autistic and non-autistic adults: Diverse experiences and implications for interventions.,"Research on motor imagery (MI) in non-autistic individuals suggests that there are shared neural circuitries between imagery and execution. The relationship between imagined and executed movements, and the use of MI in autistic adults is poorly understood. This study explored MI comprehension, prior use of MI, and subjective experiences during MI in autistic and non-autistic adults. Twenty autistic and twenty non-autistic individuals responded to a series of questions probing their understanding of and engagement in MI. Participants then completed the Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire (KVIQ), and reported on their subjective experiences during MI. Although there were no differences between the autistic and non-autistic individuals in their understanding of MI, the non-autistic group may have more prior use of MI in their everyday lives. Additionally, autistic participants generally reported less vivid imagery on the KVIQ compared to non-autistic participants, however experiences during MI varied widely across both groups ranging from vivid/intense images/sensations to the inability to imagine. In summary, some autistic individuals are able to engage in MI, but, similar to their non-autistic peers, MI ability and experiences vary across individuals. This work has important implications for MI interventions aimed at improving motor coordination.",PloS one,2025.0,Molly Brillinger; Ying Bai; April Karlinsky; Timothy N Welsh; Ellen Poliakoff; Emma Gowen,research motor imagery mi non autistic individual suggest share neural circuitry imagery execution relationship imagine execute movement use mi autistic adult poorly understand study explore mi comprehension prior use mi subjective experience mi autistic non autistic adult autistic non autistic individual respond series question probe understanding engagement mi participant complete kinesthetic visual imagery questionnaire kviq report subjective experience mi difference autistic non autistic individual understanding mi non autistic group prior use mi everyday life additionally autistic participant generally report vivid imagery kviq compare non autistic participant experience mi vary widely group range vivid intense image sensation inability imagine summary autistic individual able engage mi similar non autistic peer mi ability experience vary individual work important implication mi intervention aim improve motor coordination
40569981,Nebulized and intravenous enzyme replacement therapy in mice with mucopolysaccharidosis type II.,"Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II is a hereditary lysosomal storage disease characterized by deficiency in the enzyme iduronate 2-sulfatase (IDS). IDS is critical in the breakdown of sulfated glycosaminoglycans and its deficiency leads to an accumulation of these compounds across various tissue types resulting in multisystemic dysfunction. Intravenous administration of recombinant IDS (idursulfase) substantially improves patients' quality and length of life. However, recombinant IDS delivered intravenously is sequestered in the liver and respiratory failure remains as the leading cause of death for patients independent of idursulfase treatment, which suggests insufficient delivery to the lungs. This study aimed to assess a novel method of idursulfase administration using a nebulizer in combination with intravenous treatment and determine if this combination may improve lung delivery of idursulfase and overall pathology. Whole body IDS knockout mice underwent twelve weeks of intravenous, combination treatment, or vehicle injection and we harvested liver and lungs seven days after the last treatment for assessment of IDS activity, histological markers, and global proteomics for comparison with wild-type mice. Combination treatment increased IDS enzyme activity in the liver but not lungs Proteomics data demonstrated attenuation of key features of the disease in liver (metabolic pathways) and lungs (glycosaminoglycan pathways) with both treatments. Overall, adding nebulized administration of IDS did not lead to sustained increase in enzyme activity in the lungs but caused persistent modifications in glycosaminoglycan degradation pathway suggesting additional benefits to intravenous administration alone.",PloS one,2025.0,Alex J Shamoun; Gisienne Reis; Malaica Ashley; Anatalia Labilloy; Leonardo F Ferreira,mucopolysaccharidosis type ii hereditary lysosomal storage disease characterize deficiency enzyme iduronate 2 sulfatase ids ids critical breakdown sulfated glycosaminoglycans deficiency lead accumulation compound tissue type result multisystemic dysfunction intravenous administration recombinant ids idursulfase substantially improve patient quality length life recombinant ids deliver intravenously sequester liver respiratory failure remain lead cause death patient independent idursulfase treatment suggest insufficient delivery lung study aim assess novel method idursulfase administration nebulizer combination intravenous treatment determine combination improve lung delivery idursulfase overall pathology body ids knockout mouse undergo week intravenous combination treatment vehicle injection harvest liver lung seven day treatment assessment ids activity histological marker global proteomic comparison wild type mouse combination treatment increase ids enzyme activity liver lung proteomics datum demonstrate attenuation key feature disease liver metabolic pathway lung glycosaminoglycan pathway treatment overall add nebulized administration ids lead sustained increase enzyme activity lung cause persistent modification glycosaminoglycan degradation pathway suggest additional benefit intravenous administration
40569945,Investigating immune amnesia after measles virus infection in two West African countries: A study protocol.,"""Investigation of Immune Amnesia Following Measles Infection in Select African Regions"" (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT06153979) is a prospective, observational, longitudinal study being conducted in two West African countries; Guinea and Mali. Acute measles virus (MeV) infection has been shown to result in a loss of pre-existing immunity (immune amnesia). MeV-induced immune amnesia has not been studied in West Africa where continual MeV outbreaks occur. Additionally previous studies have relied on naturally occurring exposures to viruses to examine the immune systems ability to create antibodies. Thus, the overall goal of this protocol is to investigate the impact of MeV infection on pre-existing immunity to endemic pathogens in West Africa, observe the effect of a subsequent exposure to a novel pathogen (rabies vaccine), and measure the frequency of subsequent healthcare visits. A total of 256 children aged 1-15 years are being enrolled into one of two study arms: those with acute MeV infection (cases) as confirmed by laboratory testing and without (controls). Controls must be immune to MeV (have IgG). Blood samples are collected at multiple time points including screening (Day 0), at an optional visit to repeat IgM serology for inconclusive or negative Day 0 results (Day 7-10), and during follow-up visits on Day 14, Week 13, and Week 52. These blood samples will be tested to evaluate both humoral and cellular immune responses to a panel of viruses, bacteria, and parasites, including pathogens endemic to West Africa. To explore how recent MeV infection may affect the child's ability to respond to a new exposure, all participants will receive a rabies vaccine (as a controlled stimulus) at one of two timepoints post Day 0 visit. Biological samples will be collected after vaccination to assess if the rabies vaccine response differs: 1) between cases and controls, and 2) based on the time since acute MeV infection. In addition, the study team will collect information on healthcare encounters during the year-long follow-up to determine if there is a difference in the number of encounters by study group. The findings of this study will further the understanding of the MeV immune amnesia phenotype by understanding its impact on endemic pathogens and subsequent immune response following infection.",PloS one,2025.0,Karine Fouth Tchos; Renée Ridzon; Mory Cherif Haidara; Djeneba Dabitao; Esther Akpa; Daouda Camara; David Vallée; Mariam Coulibaly; Sekou Camara; Jamila Aboulhab; Mahamadou Diakité; Bassirou Diarra; Samba Diarra; Ilo Dicko; Alyson Francis; Cécé Francis Kolié; Michel Koropogui; Caeul Lim; Seydou Samaké; Sally Hunsberger; Moussa Sidibé; Ray Y Chen; Issa Konate; Seydou Doumbia; Abdoul Habib Beavogui; Kathryn Shaw-Saliba,investigation immune amnesia follow measles infection select african regions clinicaltrials.gov identifier nct06153979 prospective observational longitudinal study conduct west african country guinea mali acute measle virus mev infection show result loss pre exist immunity immune amnesia mev induce immune amnesia study west africa continual mev outbreak occur additionally previous study rely naturally occur exposure virus examine immune system ability create antibody overall goal protocol investigate impact mev infection pre exist immunity endemic pathogen west africa observe effect subsequent exposure novel pathogen rabie vaccine measure frequency subsequent healthcare visit total 256 child age 1 15 year enrol study arm acute mev infection case confirm laboratory testing control control immune mev igg blood sample collect multiple time point include screening day 0 optional visit repeat igm serology inconclusive negative day 0 result day 7 10 follow visit day 14 week 13 week 52 blood sample test evaluate humoral cellular immune response panel virus bacteria parasite include pathogen endemic west africa explore recent mev infection affect child ability respond new exposure participant receive rabies vaccine control stimulus timepoint post day 0 visit biological sample collect vaccination assess rabie vaccine response differ 1 case control 2 base time acute mev infection addition study team collect information healthcare encounter year long follow determine difference number encounter study group finding study understanding mev immune amnesia phenotype understand impact endemic pathogen subsequent immune response follow infection

Here we have predicted the structural determinants of the Michaelis complex of this mutant using a QM/MM MD-based protocol. It shows some important differences with the X-ray structure, from the metal coordination to the positioning of key residues at the active site. In particular, one lysine residue (K212) emerges as a mostly likely proton donor in the key proton-transfer step of the R132H IDH1 catalytic reaction. Intriguingly, the same residue in its deprotonated state is likely to be involved in the reaction catalyzed by the wild-type enzyme (though the mechanisms are different). Our QM/MM protocol could also be used for other metal-based enzymes, which cannot be modelled easily by force field-based MD, like in this case.",PloS one,2025.0,Bharath Raghavan; Marco De Vivo; Paolo Carloni,r132h idh1 important therapeutic target variety brain cancer drug lead radiotracer selectively bind mutant wild type far lacking predict structural determinant michaelis complex mutant qm mm md base protocol show important difference x ray structure metal coordination positioning key residue active site particular lysine residue k212 emerge likely proton donor key proton transfer step r132h idh1 catalytic reaction intriguingly residue deprotonate state likely involve reaction catalyze wild type enzyme mechanism different qm mm protocol metal base enzyme model easily force field base md like case
40569933,Trends of long-term opioid therapy and subsequent discontinuation among people with chronic non-cancer pain in UK primary care: A retrospective cohort study.,"To examine trends of opioid use, focusing on long-term opioid therapy (L-TOT) and its discontinuation among people with chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP). Retrospective cohort study using UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum data. Incident opioid users (no opioid use in the prior year) with CNCP between 01/01/2009-31/12/2019. Among them, we identified L-TOT users (≥3 opioid prescriptions within 90 days, or total ≥90 supply days within the first year, excluding the initial 30 days) and L-TOT discontinuers (no opioid use for ≥180 days following a L-TOT). Yearly rates of incident opioid users (over CPRD-registered patients), L-TOT users (over incident opioid users), and L-TOT discontinuers (over L-TOT users) were calculated. Annual counts of each group were fitted using segmented negative binomial regression models with an offset considering their corresponding denominators from 2009 to 2019, excluding 2014 due to policy changes in that year. Among 2,839,161 incident opioid users, 11.4% (n = 324,877) transitioned into L-TOT users within one year, of which 4.8% (n = 15,484) discontinued. Between 2009-2013, rates of L-TOT users significantly declined by 2.6% (incidence rate ratio: 0.974; 95% confidence interval: 0.971 to 0.978) per annum, followed by a significant step change in 2015 (1.026, 1.009 to1.044), and a significant annual increase of 2.4% (1.024, 1.019 to 1.029) from 2015 to 2019, compared to the 2009-2013 trend. The annual rates of L-TOT discontinuers remained stable from 2009 to 2013 (0.987, 0.971 to 1.002), followed by a non-significant step change (0.990, 0.916 to 1.070) in 2015, and a significant decrease in slope by 2.6% (0.974, 0.951 to 0.998) per annum during 2015-2019, relative to 2009-2013. L-TOT has plateaued since 2015, accompanied with an accelerated decrease in discontinuation rates, suggesting ongoing reliance on opioids for CNCP management, despite increased awareness regarding L-TOT associated risks. This is likely due to the limited availability of other effective pharmacological options and non-pharmacological alternatives, and challenges in their accessibility.",PloS one,2025.0,Qian Cai; Yun-Ting Huang; Thomas Allen; Charlotte Morris; Christos Grigoroglou; Evangelos Kontopantelis,"examine trend opioid use focus long term opioid therapy l tot discontinuation people chronic non cancer pain cncp retrospective cohort study uk clinical practice research datalink aurum datum incident opioid user opioid use prior year cncp 01/01/2009 31/12/2019 identify l tot user ≥3 opioid prescription 90 day total ≥90 supply day year exclude initial 30 day l tot discontinuer opioid use ≥180 day follow l tot yearly rate incident opioid user cprd register patient l tot user incident opioid user l tot discontinuer l tot user calculate annual count group fit segment negative binomial regression model offset consider corresponding denominator 2009 2019 exclude 2014 policy change year 2,839,161 incident opioid user 11.4 n = 324,877 transition l tot user year 4.8 n = 15,484 discontinue 2009 2013 rate l tot user significantly decline 2.6 incidence rate ratio 0.974 95 confidence interval 0.971 0.978 annum follow significant step change 2015 1.026 1.009 to1.044 significant annual increase 2.4 1.024 1.019 1.029 2015 2019 compare 2009 2013 trend annual rate l tot discontinuer remain stable 2009 2013 0.987 0.971 1.002 follow non significant step change 0.990 0.916 1.070 2015 significant decrease slope 2.6 0.974 0.951 0.998 annum 2015 2019 relative 2009 2013 l tot plateaue 2015 accompany accelerated decrease discontinuation rate suggest ongoing reliance opioid cncp management despite increase awareness l tot associate risk likely limited availability effective pharmacological option non pharmacological alternative challenge accessibility"
40569930,Neurologists' perspectives on management challenges and mitigation strategies for Parkinson's disease patients: A qualitative study in Iraq.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is currently the fastest-growing neurological disorder in the world. Patients with PD face numerous challenges in managing their chronic condition, particularly in countries with scarce healthcare infrastructure. This qualitative study aimed to delve into neurologists' perspectives on challenges and gaps in the Iraqi healthcare system that influence the management of PD, as well as strategies to mitigate these obstacles. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with neurologists from five different Iraqi provinces, working in both hospitals and private neurology clinics, between November 2024 and January 2025. A thematic analysis approach was employed to identify the main challenges and gaps in the healthcare system, along with potential mitigation strategies for improving PD management in Iraq. Fourteen neurologists participated in this study. Among them, 71.4% identified medication adherence as a major challenge, followed by motor symptoms (64.3%). Physical dependency due to motor impairment was the most reported limitation affecting daily life and disease management. Neurologists cited several factors influencing patients' knowledge, including educational background, depression or family support, were mentioned by neurologists. Significant gaps in the Iraqi healthcare system were noted, such as the lack of specialized abnormal movement disorders clinics, multidisciplinary collaboration, a universal healthcare system, insufficient public PD awareness, and the presence of unregulated pharmaceuticals in the market. Addressing these challenges requires policy-driven reforms, enhanced regulatory oversight and the integration of multidisciplinary care frameworks to optimize the management of individuals with PD. Strengthening patient education and professional training programs could further raise public awareness and improve care quality. Future research should focus on evaluating the effects of these proposed interventions on clinical outcomes for PD patients and promoting more patient-centered care for individuals with PD in Iraq.",PloS one,2025.0,Mena Khalid Ibrahim; Samer Imad Mohammed; Gheyath Abd Ali Shallal Al-Gawwam,parkinson disease pd currently fast grow neurological disorder world patient pd face numerous challenge manage chronic condition particularly country scarce healthcare infrastructure qualitative study aim delve neurologist perspective challenge gap iraqi healthcare system influence management pd strategy mitigate obstacle semi structured interview conduct neurologist different iraqi province work hospital private neurology clinic november 2024 january 2025 thematic analysis approach employ identify main challenge gap healthcare system potential mitigation strategy improve pd management iraq fourteen neurologist participate study 71.4 identify medication adherence major challenge follow motor symptom 64.3 physical dependency motor impairment report limitation affect daily life disease management neurologist cite factor influence patient knowledge include educational background depression family support mention neurologist significant gap iraqi healthcare system note lack specialized abnormal movement disorder clinic multidisciplinary collaboration universal healthcare system insufficient public pd awareness presence unregulated pharmaceutical market address challenge require policy drive reform enhance regulatory oversight integration multidisciplinary care framework optimize management individual pd strengthen patient education professional training program raise public awareness improve care quality future research focus evaluate effect propose intervention clinical outcome pd patient promote patient center care individual pd iraq
40569927,Lactoferrin combined with Coenzyme Q10 ameliorate sarcopenia in an aging mouse model induced by D-galactose.,"Sarcopenia is an age-related condition with a slow and prolonged decrease in muscular mass, strength, and function. As the population ages, the frequency of sarcopenia rises, and aggressive prevention methods and effective treatment options are in urgent need. Here, we explore the hypothesis that nutritional interventions can ameliorate skeletal muscle aging in mice affected by sarcopenia, and the aforementioned hypothesis was validated through histopathological characterization and behavioral experiments. The model group exhibited reduced muscle mass (Lean Mass, GAS Index), muscular strength (Maximum Limb Muscle Strength), and muscular function (Exhaustion Time, Inverted Grid Time), along with increased fat content and smaller myofiber size compared to the control group. Treatments with lactoferrin and CoQ10, both individually and in combination, enhanced muscle indices and facilitated muscle tissue regeneration, with the combined treatment showing the most significant improvement. Research further shows that Lactoferrin and CoQ10, whether administered alone or in combination, were discovered to restrain the progression of sarcopenia by inhibiting both protein metabolism and mitochondrial energy metabolism, and compared to groups treated with lactoferrin or CoQ10 alone, the combined treatment demonstrated varying degrees of improvement across all evaluated metrics, such as Lean Mass (2.273 ~ 5.365%), Fat Mass (-1.058 ~ -0.359%), GAS index (0.259 ~ 0.335%), Maximum Limb Muscle Strength (6.83 ~ 53.498 g), Inverted Grid Time (563 ~ 859 s), Exhaustion Time (386 ~ 468 s).",PloS one,2025.0,Wenbin Wu; Yinhua Zhu; Yanan Fu; Hongfei Xing; Xinlu Guo; Jichao Xu; Wenhui Hu; Mingyang Cui; Jiaxin Shi; Ling Li; Weiwei Wang; Peng An; Yongting Luo; Junjie Luo; Qingchang Xing,sarcopenia age relate condition slow prolonged decrease muscular mass strength function population age frequency sarcopenia rise aggressive prevention method effective treatment option urgent need explore hypothesis nutritional intervention ameliorate skeletal muscle age mouse affect sarcopenia aforementioned hypothesis validate histopathological characterization behavioral experiment model group exhibit reduce muscle mass lean mass gas index muscular strength maximum limb muscle strength muscular function exhaustion time inverted grid time increase fat content small myofiber size compare control group treatment lactoferrin coq10 individually combination enhance muscle index facilitated muscle tissue regeneration combine treatment show significant improvement research show lactoferrin coq10 administer combination discover restrain progression sarcopenia inhibit protein metabolism mitochondrial energy metabolism compare group treat lactoferrin coq10 combine treatment demonstrate vary degree improvement evaluated metric lean mass 2.273 ~ 5.365 fat mass -1.058 ~ -0.359 gas index 0.259 ~ 0.335 maximum limb muscle strength 6.83 ~ 53.498 g inverted grid time 563 ~ 859 s exhaustion time 386 ~ 468 s
40569913,Retrospective evaluation of Facial nerve monitoring to prevent nerve damage during robotic drilling in the largest series of patients undergoing the HEARO-procedure.,"Robot-assisted cochlear implantation surgery (RACIS) involves the drilling of a keyhole access to the inner ear for cochlear implant placement to treat patients with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss. RACIS with the HEARO-procedure does not require the drilling of a mastoidectomy and posterior tympanotomy to pass through the facial recess. Instead, it directly drills through it guarding a safe distance from both the facial nerve and chorda tympani. Cochlear implantation surgery involves a well described risk for facial nerve injury when passing through the facial recess. Neuromonitoring as a safety protocol gained great importance in conventional CI surgery and is proving its benefits in RACIS. RACIS in the HEARO-procedure involves a customized facial nerve monitoring (FNM) device that was designed and tested in an animal model study. Here, this device was retrospectively assessed in the largest series of patients undergoing the HEARO-procedure. The safety protocol in the HEARO-procedure involves FNM and intra-operative cone-beam CT (CBCT) imaging with a 0.1 mm spatial resolution. The customized FNM device was employed, using both active mono- and bipolar stimulation to estimate the distance to the facial nerve in RACIS. Linear regression was used to determine if the minimum stimulation thresholds (FNM) could significantly predict the intra-operative distance (CBCT) between the drilled trajectory and the facial nerve. Logistic regression was used to calculate if FNM can distinguish distances smaller and greater than 0.4 mm to the facial nerve. The minimum stimulation thresholds significantly predicted the distances between the drilling trajectory and the facial nerve for both the monopolar (p = 0.001) and bipolar 3 (p = 0.008) stimulation configuration. Both the monopolar (β = -0.189, S.E. = 0.063, p = 0.003) and bipolar 3 (β = -0.187, S.E. = 0.080, p = 0.019) stimulation configuration are negative and significant predictors of the probability of the distance being smaller than 0.4 mm. FNM will alert the surgeon when the drilling trajectory comes closer than 0.4 mm to the facial nerve in RACIS.

40569905,"Rare and novel variant load threshold for KIF7, GJA1 and PDE1C genes elevates the risk of severity of congenital heart defects in Down syndrome.","Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) exhibit a higher incidence of congenital heart defects (CHD). The objective of the present study was to investigate ethnicity-specific genetic variants that increase the risk of CHD in children with DS from the Indian Bengali population. We conducted whole exome sequencing of the genomes of Down syndrome children with and without CHD and subsequently tested the identified variants in a larger cohort (N = 1798). Our findings revealed two rare variants, KIF7 rs138354681 and GJA1 rs778110855, as well as one novel variant, PDE1C PP785745, present in children with DS and CHD but absent in those without CHD. In-silico analyses indicated that these variants are pathogenic. The frequencies of the heterozygous genotypes for KIF7 rs138354681, GJA1 rs778110855, and PDE1C PP785745 were recorded as 0.027, 0.016, and 0.032, respectively. Among the 31 carriers identified, 18 individuals exhibited two variants, while four were found to have three co-occurring variants. The majority of these individuals required surgical intervention for correction, in contrast to single variant carriers, of whom only three out of nine needed surgeries. A polygenic risk score analysis revealed higher score to be significantly associated with both the presence of multiple variants and the subsequent need for surgical correction. We hypothesise that the synergistic effects of multiple variants heighten the severity of CHD, particularly in cases of ventricular septal defects, thereby necessitating surgical correction. These findings significantly enhance our understanding of the unique population-specific aetiology of CHD and the basis for the severity of its clinical presentation in individuals with Down syndrome.",PloS one,2025.0,Agnish Ganguly; Samudra Pal; Srilagna Chatterjee; Madhusudan Das; Sumantra Sarkar; Sujay Ghosh,individual syndrome ds exhibit high incidence congenital heart defect chd objective present study investigate ethnicity specific genetic variant increase risk chd child ds indian bengali population conduct exome sequence genome syndrome child chd subsequently test identify variant large cohort n = 1798 finding reveal rare variant kif7 rs138354681 gja1 rs778110855 novel variant pde1c pp785745 present child ds chd absent chd silico analysis indicate variant pathogenic frequency heterozygous genotype kif7 rs138354681 gja1 rs778110855 pde1c pp785745 record 0.027 0.016 0.032 respectively 31 carrier identify 18 individual exhibit variant find co occurring variant majority individual require surgical intervention correction contrast single variant carrier need surgery polygenic risk score analysis reveal high score significantly associate presence multiple variant subsequent need surgical correction hypothesise synergistic effect multiple variant heighten severity chd particularly case ventricular septal defect necessitate surgical correction finding significantly enhance understanding unique population specific aetiology chd basis severity clinical presentation individual syndrome
40569901,Progression and natural history of Atypical Parkinsonism (ATPARK): Protocol for a longitudinal follow-up study from an underrepresented population.,"Atypical Parkinsonian Syndromes (APS) form the third largest group of neurodegenerative disorders including Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), and Corticobasal Syndrome (CBS). These conditions are characterized by rapid progression, poor prognosis, low survival rates, and limited treatment options. Few studies have suggested that genetic, environmental factors and inflammation contribute to the pathobiology of these complex disorders, however, the etiology of disease and progression remains unclear. A multicenter prospective longitudinal (3-time point) study will be conducted with a total sample size of 400 across all the groups (PSP, MSA, CBS). Patients with APS will be recruited after a detailed evaluation by movement disorder specialists and obtaining valid informed consent. The socio-demographic data and whole exome sequencing will be performed only at the baseline. Non-invasive procedures such as neurological and cognitive assessments, sleep quality assessments including polysomnography, brain imaging, and retinal imaging will be conducted at each time point. In addition, gene expressions, methylation patterns, inflammatory cytokines, disease-associated pathological proteins (Tau, pTau-181, α-synuclein and β-amyloid), non-targeted proteomics, skin biopsy, and iPSC will be performed at each time point eventually. The statistical analysis will be performed, followed by the developing of machine learning (ML) models. This unique native dataset in APS will enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving pathological protein aggregation and disease progression.

40569893,Esotropia Induced by Slipped Lateral Rectus Muscle After Orbital Fat Herniation Surgery: A Case Report.,"BACKGROUND Strabismus and diplopia are well-documented complications following various ophthalmic surgeries; however, no prior reports have linked these complications to orbital fat herniation surgery. Here, we report a case of secondary esotropia resulting from lateral rectus muscle injury following orbital fat herniation surgery. CASE REPORT A man in his 60s presented to our hospital with diplopia during distance fixation, which he noticed a few days after undergoing orbital fat herniation surgery on his right eye. His visual acuity was 24/20 in both eyes. Alternate prism cover testing revealed esotropia of 30 prism diopters for both distance- and near-vision. Mild limitation of abduction in the right eye and conjunctival scarring near the lateral rectus muscle were noted. Injury to the lateral rectus muscle during the previous surgery was suspected. However, due to the mild degree of abduction limitation, transient diplopia was also considered, and the patient was initially observed. However, no improvement in abduction limitation or esotropia was noted over the following months. Consequently, strabismus surgery was performed 8 months after the initial procedure. Intraoperatively, a slipped lateral rectus muscle was identified, and the muscle was advanced to a position 7 mm posterior to the limbus on the sclera. The patient's abduction improved, and satisfactory ocular alignment was achieved postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS When strabismus with ocular motility limitation is observed after orbital fat herniation surgery, the possibility of lateral rectus muscle injury should be considered.

40569767,Clinical utility of the Level of Personality Functioning Scale: A survey of German mental health professionals.,"The Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders and <i>ICD-11</i> adopt a dimensional approach to personality disorders, defining them in terms of impairments in self-related (identity, self-direction) and interpersonal (empathy, intimacy) personality functions. This study examined the clinical utility of a clinician-rated global evaluation of personality functioning based on the Level of Personality Functioning Scale (LPFS). A total of 346 German mental health professionals provided LPFS ratings for 1,403 patients, stratified by 38 diagnostic categories, including, but not limited to, personality disorders. Clinicians reported on each patient's treatment outcome, recommended optimal treatment components for each patient, and provided their perspective on the clinical utility of the LPFS and its potential risk of stigmatizing patients. On average, clinicians rated the LPFS as ""very useful,"" its applicability as ""rather easy,"" and the risk of patient stigmatization as ""rather low."" Logistic and ordinal Bayesian multilevel models indicated meaningful associations between LPFS ratings and clinical judgments, highlighting its effectiveness in conveying clinical impressions. Greater impairments in personality functioning were associated with poorer clinician-rated treatment outcome and poorer prognosis. In addition, associations with optimal treatment components yielded a nuanced pattern, with clinicians typically recommending short-term outpatient psychotherapy for patients with mild impairments, long-term psychotherapy for patients with moderate to severe impairments, and intensive care interventions (e.g., outreach care, assisted living) for those with extreme impairments. The results indicate that German mental health professionals consider the LPFS to be a clinically useful concept and that it may be valuable in organizing and communicating information about patients.

40569765,The most influential decision factors for choosing a formal diagnostic classification system for describing personality pathology.,"There are currently three models for diagnosing personality disorders for practitioners to choose from in the formal diagnostic classification systems <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)</i> and <i>International Classification of Diseases</i> (ICD): the categorical model retained from <i>DSM-IV</i>, a dimensional model in the <i>ICD-11,</i> and the <i>DSM-5</i> Alternative Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD) that is a hybrid of categorical and dimensional methods. We used a sequential mixed-methods approach to explore how psychologists and psychiatrists decide which model to use for diagnosing personality pathology. In Study 1, we elicited eight themes and seven subthemes that capture the factors that psychologists and psychiatrists (<i>N</i> = 18) consider when deciding whether or not to use the AMPD. In Study 2, these themes were converted to 16 statements reflecting factors that practitioners might consider when deciding which diagnostic model to use when working in a therapeutic role. Psychiatrists (<i>n</i> = 13) and psychologists (<i>n</i> = 70) rated each of the 16 factors according to the degree to which they influence deciding which diagnostic model to use. The most important factors were those pertaining to usefulness in communicating personality information, knowledge about and training in each model, usefulness of the model for describing clients' difficulties and pathology, and level of acceptance of the model by peers and experts in the field. While our data do not identify which model lends itself best to clear communication about personality functioning, or which model is most scientifically sound and accepted within the field, our data indicate that practitioners consider those things important, so clear guidance about those matters based on empirical evidence is needed.

40569749,The enemy within one's own ranks: Meta-analysis on the effects of psychopathy on workplace-related behavior.,"Despite the large and growing number of studies on psychopathy in the workplace, the field lacks a comprehensive understanding of the link between psychopathy and core workplace-related behaviors. Basing assumptions on social exchange theory, the purpose of this meta-analytic review (<i>k</i> = 166; <i>N</i> = 49,350) is (a) to test the relationship of psychopathy with task performance, organizational citizenship behavior, and counterproductive work behavior, (b) to differentiate the relationships of primary versus secondary psychopathy with these behaviors, and (c) to test for relevant moderating influences by actor- and target-/exchange-partner factors. In contrast to earlier significant but weak meta-analytic findings (O'Boyle et al., 2012), both meta-analytic overall effects and meta-analytic structural equation modeling suggest that psychopathy substantially reduces task performance and organizational citizenship behavior and enhances counterproductive work behavior. Compared to primary psychopathy, effects were mostly more pronounced for secondary psychopathy. Besides methodological factors, moderator analyses revealed relationships to vary by actor (age, organizational tenure, hierarchical level) but not by target. Together, these findings point toward new and relevant directions for future research on the effects of psychopathy in the workplace.

This commentary reviews Hyatt, Phillips, et al. (2025), highlighting the critical clinical training gaps related to working with individuals exhibiting externalizing and antagonistic behaviors. Hyatt, Phillips, et al.'s (2025) findings reveal that graduate students receive less training and experience working with these populations compared to clients with internalizing disorders, contributing to lower self-efficacy and greater emotional strain in therapeutic encounters. This commentary discusses the urgent need for enhanced training, including exposure to structured evidence-based interventions for child conduct disorders, such as Parent-Child Interaction Therapy and its adaptation for children with callous-unemotional traits. It also discusses possible reasons for Hyatt, Phillips, et al.'s (2025) findings, including the pervasive underfunding of research on conduct disorders and psychopathy, which contributes to the scarcity of effective treatments. Finally, future training initiatives are considered, including the potential of novel training techniques such as deliberate practice and simulation-based education to improve psychology trainee's clinical competence in working with clients with antagonism.

One hundred fifty-eight adults (53.2% female) with AUD, serious mental illness, and a mean uEtG ≥ 350 ng/mL over a 4-week induction period were randomized to (a) usual CM (uEtG-negative [<150 ng/mL] samples reinforced with $1,686); (b) high magnitude CM (uEtG-negative samples reinforced with $2,983); or (c) shaping CM (reduced drinking [uEtG < 500 ng/mL] samples reinforced for 4 weeks, then uEtG-negative samples reinforced for 12 weeks with $1,686). The primary outcome was uEtG-negative samples during induction and Weeks 5-16 of CM. The relationship between outcomes and uEtG-defined heavy drinking (≥ 500 ng/mL) immediately prior to randomization was assessed.

Higher cognitive abilities were associated with a monotonically decreasing risk of developing all the studied mental disorders except bipolar disorder. The association held even when comparing the cognitive abilities of brothers raised in the same family, attesting that cognitive ability and mental disorders are not associated because both arise from the same family background circumstances. Similarly, individuals with higher educational attainment had fewer mental health disorders.

40569596,Availability of Medications for Opioid Use Disorder in Opioid Treatment Programs.,"As the primary facilities authorized to dispense methadone, opioid treatment programs (OTPs) are a critical access point for medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). However, research is limited on the extent to which OTPs offer a broad range of MOUD and on the characteristics of programs that provide more comprehensive medication offerings. To assess the percentage of US OTPs offering all 3 forms of MOUD (methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone) and compare organizational and county characteristics of OTPs with different MOUD service offerings. This longitudinal cross-sectional study used data on a panel of OTPs listed in the annual National Directory of Drug and Alcohol Use Treatment Facilities from 2017 to 2023. Measures included the percentage of OTPs offering buprenorphine, extended-release naltrexone, or all 3 MOUD from 2017 to 2023 (assuming all OTPs offered methadone). Descriptive statistics on organizational and county characteristics of OTPs by MOUD offerings were collected. Three longitudinal logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of different MOUD offerings within OTPs, adjusting for organizational and county-level characteristics. This analysis included 10 298 facility-year observations, ranging from 1211 in 2017 to 1421 in 2023. From 2017 to 2023, the percentage of OTPs offering MOUD beyond methadone increased (buprenorphine: 811 [67.0%] in 2017 to 1209 [85.1%] in 2023; naltrexone: 463 [38.2%] in 2017 to 749 [52.7%] in 2023; all 3 MOUD: 402 [33.2%] in 2017 to 639 [45.0%] in 2023). OTPs offering all 3 MOUD (3985 [38.7%]) had significantly higher odds of accepting Medicare (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.14; 95% CI, 1.67-2.74); offering peer services (AOR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.25-2.12), mental health services (AOR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.53-2.80), and telemedicine services (AOR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.22-1.92); and being private nonprofit (AOR, 7.45; 95% CI, 4.67-11.87) or government operated (AOR, 41.83; 95% CI, 19.71-88.75) compared with private for profit. In this cross-sectional study of OTPs, although the availability of MOUD beyond methadone increased over time, most OTPs still did not offer all 3 forms of MOUD as of 2023.

40569594,Severe Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy in a US Naval Special Warfare Combatant Crewman.,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a tauopathy mostly observed following a history of repeated impact-type head injury, usually from contact sports. The overwhelming majority of published, high-stage CTE cases are in older, former high-level contact sport athletes. CTE was infrequent in a large case series of brains donated by military service members, wherein it was most often of minimal severity, while being unanimously present in former contact sport participants. To describe the neuropathological examination of a brain donated from a US Naval special warfare combatant crewman (SWCC) who had a 12-year career. This case study of a whole brain specimen donated after death from a 44.9-year-old military donor with multiple deployments was conducted at a US biorepository dedicated to studies of brains donated from deceased military personnel. The detailed neuropathological examination included comprehensive molecular genetic testing. SWCC are trained to execute high-risk warfare and reconnaissance missions typically operating small, mobile, fast watercraft in numerous maritime environments, including operation in the high seas. In this context, SWCC sustain repetitive physical forces to the body from high-speed boat impacts with waves, which may number in the millions. Postmortem diagnosis for CTE using the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NINDS-NIBIB) consensus criteria as well as the McKee staging system; molecular genetic assessment for neurodegenerative disease. The case specimen was from a male 44.9-year-old who served a 12.2-year SWCC career from ages 28.9 to 41.1 years. Following his last deployment, he experienced posttraumatic stress disorder, alcohol misuse, migraines, and impaired cognition. He died by suicide.

40569592,Receipt of Buprenorphine and Naltrexone for Opioid Use Disorder by Race and Ethnicity and Insurance Type.,"Despite expanded efforts to improve treatment access, inequities exist in the receipt of medications for opioid use disorder by race and ethnicity and insurance type. To examine inequities in access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD)-specifically buprenorphine and naltrexone-by race and ethnicity and insurance type after opioid-related health care events. This retrospective cohort study used data from the Institute for Health Equity Research Multi-Payor Claims Database, which includes more than 130 million individuals across commercial, Medicaid, and Medicare Advantage insurance plans. The cohort consisted of patients aged 18 years or older with an opioid use disorder (OUD)-related health care event (opioid-related overdose, infection, or treatment event) that occurred between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2022. Statistical analysis was conducted from October 2023 to December 2024. Race and ethnicity and insurance type, including commercial insurance, Medicaid, and Medicare Advantage, were the primary exposures. The primary outcome was receipt of MOUD (buprenorphine or naltrexone) within 180 days of an OUD-related health care event. Logistic regression models were used to assess the associations of MOUD receipt with race and ethnicity and with insurance type, adjusting for demographic, clinical, time, and geographical covariates. Among 176 997 index events involving 164 728 patients between 2017 and 2022, the mean (SD) patient age was 40.0 (13.1) years; 104 005 (58.8%) involved men; 1083 events (0.6%) were among Asian patients, 23 424 (13.2%) were among Black patients, 10 302 (5.8%) were among Hispanic patients, 90 124 (50.9%) were among White patients, and 4697 (2.7%) were among patients of other race and ethnicity; and 147 257 (83.2%) were covered by Medicaid. Black (adjusted estimated probability, 17.1% [95% CI, 13.0%-21.1%]) and Hispanic (adjusted estimated probability, 16.2% [95% CI, 11.6%-20.8%]) patients were significantly less likely than White patients (adjusted estimated probability, 20.5% [95% CI, 16.4%-24.7%]) to receive buprenorphine (Black patients: adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.75 [95% CI, 0.63-0.90]; adjusted risk difference [ARD], -3.4 percentage points [pp] [95% CI, -6.5 to -0.4 pp]; Hispanic patients: AOR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.51-0.92]; ARD, -4.4 pp [95% CI, -9.1 to 0.4 pp]) but received naltrexone at similar rates. Patients with Medicaid (AOR, 1.39 [95% CI, 1.14-1.69]; ARD, 3.5 pp [95% CI, 0.9-6.1 pp]) or Medicare Advantage (AOR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.05-1.86]; ARD, 3.6 pp [95% CI, -0.6 to 7.7 pp]) were more likely to receive buprenorphine compared with those with commercial insurance. Buprenorphine access improved incrementally from 2017 to 2022, reflecting recent clinical and policy changes; however, disparities persisted. In this cohort study of more than 17 600 opioid-related index health care events, race and ethnicity-based and insurance-based disparities in access to MOUD persisted despite efforts to expand treatment availability. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions, including culturally tailored care, expanded access points, and policy reforms to address structural barriers and reduce inequities contributing to the overdose crisis.",JAMA network open,2025.0,Utsha G Khatri; Christopher Lopez; Yun-Ting Yen; Emilia J Ling; Lynne D Richardson; Ka Ming Ngai,despite expand effort improve treatment access inequity exist receipt medication opioid use disorder race ethnicity insurance type examine inequity access medication opioid use disorder moud)-specifically buprenorphine naltrexone race ethnicity insurance type opioid relate health care event retrospective cohort study datum institute health equity research multi payor claims database include 130 million individual commercial medicaid medicare advantage insurance plan cohort consist patient age 18 year old opioid use disorder oud)-relate health care event opioid relate overdose infection treatment event occur january 1 2017 december 31 2022 statistical analysis conduct october 2023 december 2024 race ethnicity insurance type include commercial insurance medicaid medicare advantage primary exposure primary outcome receipt moud buprenorphine naltrexone 180 day oud relate health care event logistic regression model assess association moud receipt race ethnicity insurance type adjust demographic clinical time geographical covariate 176 997 index event involve 164 728 patient 2017 2022 mean sd patient age 40.0 13.1 year 104 005 58.8 involve man 1083 event 0.6 asian patient 23 424 13.2 black patient 10 302 5.8 hispanic patient 90 124 50.9 white patient 4697 2.7 patient race ethnicity 147 257 83.2 cover medicaid black adjust estimate probability 17.1 95 ci 13.0%-21.1 hispanic adjust estimate probability 16.2 95 ci 11.6%-20.8 patient significantly likely white patient adjust estimate probability 20.5 95 ci 16.4%-24.7 receive buprenorphine black patient adjust odd ratio aor 0.75 95 ci 0.63 0.90 adjusted risk difference ard -3.4 percentage point pp 95 ci -6.5 -0.4 pp hispanic patient aor 0.69 95 ci 0.51 0.92 ard -4.4 pp 95 ci -9.1 0.4 pp receive naltrexone similar rate patient medicaid aor 1.39 95 ci 1.14 1.69 ard 3.5 pp 95 ci 0.9 6.1 pp medicare advantage aor 1.40 95 ci 1.05 1.86 ard 3.6 pp 95 ci -0.6 7.7 pp likely receive buprenorphine compare commercial insurance buprenorphine access improve incrementally 2017 2022 reflect recent clinical policy change disparity persist cohort study 17 600 opioid relate index health care event race ethnicity base insurance base disparity access moud persist despite effort expand treatment availability finding underscore need target intervention include culturally tailor care expand access point policy reform address structural barrier reduce inequity contribute overdose crisis

40569533,Circulating inflammatory proteins as pathogenic mediators and potential therapeutic targets in myasthenia gravis.,"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a neurological immune-mediated disorder affecting approximately three million people worldwide. While specific circulating inflammatory proteins (CIPs), including cytokines and chemokines, have been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of MG, their causal roles remain poorly understood. A cis-Mendelian randomization (MR) framework was utilized to assess the genetically inferred causal associations between 91 CIPs, as proxied by protein quantitative trait loci, and the risk of MG. The inverse-variance weighted method served as the primary analytical approach, supplemented by sensitivity analyses to ensure the robustness of our findings and compliance with key MR assumptions. Furthermore, enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses were conducted to determine the functional associations among the significant CIPs. Positive associations were observed between plasma TNFSF12 levels and both MG and late-onset MG. Additionally, elevated plasma levels of CD244 and CXCL6 were associated with an increased risk of late-onset MG. In contrast, early-onset MG exhibited significant negative associations with plasma levels of GDNF, IL12B, and IL18R1, but a positive association with CX3CL1 levels. These key findings were further validated through sensitivity analyses. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis indicated that the identified CIPs are primarily involved in biological processes related to natural killer and T cell immune responses, whereas PPI analysis revealed their interactions with other mainstay drug targets for MG. Our study genetically established several CIPs as culprits contributing to disease causation and potential therapeutic druggable targets for MG.

40569532,GDF15: An emerging disease target and biomarker of metabolic diseases.,"Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), a member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, has garnered increasing attention for its involvement in metabolic regulation. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the secretion mechanisms and functional roles of GDF15 in metabolic diseases (MD), with the goal of informing future clinical diagnostics, guiding biomarker discovery, and advancing personalized treatment strategies. This review synthesizes findings from both experimental and clinical studies that investigate the physiological expression, regulatory mechanisms, and systemic actions of GDF15. Particular focus is placed on the GDF15-GFRAL-RET signaling axis and its influence on glucose and lipid metabolism, appetite regulation, and energy homeostasis across key metabolic organs and systems. Numerous studies have established a robust correlation between serum GDF15 concentrations and a spectrum of MD. The GDF15-GFRAL-RET signaling pathway is responsible for modulating glucose and lipid metabolism, suppressing appetite, and maintaining energy homeostasis by integrating the actions of various tissue systems, such as the liver, adipose tissue, muscle, the central nervous system, and the peripheral sympathetic nervous system. Additionally, these regulatory effects are largely independent of appetite-regulating hormones such as leptin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and they may exhibit coordinated effects. GDF15 plays a key role in metabolic regulation and shows strong potential as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for MD.

40569487,Association between traumatic brain injury and risk of developing infections in the central nervous system and periphery.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is defined as structural damage or physiological disruption of brain function resulting from mechanisms such as direct impact, rapid acceleration or deceleration, penetrating injury, or exposure to blast waves. These biomechanical insults initiate a complex cascade of secondary injury processes, including neuronal cell death, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, microglial activation, and blood-brain barrier dysfunction. These events contribute to the loss of homeostasis in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Importantly, these pathophysiological changes may extend beyond the acute phase, often evolving into chronic conditions that can persist for years after the initial injury. In addition, TBI can cause fractures of the skull base and predispose to CSF leak and CSF fistula, which contribute to the contraction of bacteria. Surgical interventions, invasive devices, and prolonged immobilization are other factors that predispose patients to develop an infection secondary to TBI. Among the infections developed secondarily by patients with TBI are meningitis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections, which can progress to Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis. Furthermore, immunosuppression due to the lack of components of the cellular immune response, particularly neutrophils, helper T cells, regulatory T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, demonstrates the pathophysiological heterogeneity of TBI, which can result in complications involving the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS).

40569474,Association of Sarcopenic Obesity and Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women: Risk Factors and Protective Effects of Hormonal Therapy and Nutritional Status.,"The cross-sectional study of postmenopausal Thai women discovered a strong association between both sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity and osteoporosis. The risk of sarcopenic obesity was found to increase with poor nutritional status, while a history of menopausal hormone therapy was shown to offer protection. The study aims to investigate the association between sarcopenic obesity and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and to identify risk factors for sarcopenic obesity. Our comprehensive cross-sectional study involved 248 Thai postmenopausal women aged 45-80. Osteoporosis was defined as a bone mineral density (BMD) T-score of less than -2.5 at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck, as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Sarcopenic obesity is defined as the co-existence of obesity and sarcopenia according to the criteria established by the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) and the European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO). Sarcopenia was defined as skeletal muscle mass adjusted by weight (SMM/W) <35.6%, assessed via Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA), and compromised muscle function, which includes low hand grip strength (<18 kg) or poor physical performance (chair-stand test time ≥17 seconds). Obesity was defined as a fat mass percentage >41%, a body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, or a waist circumference ≥80 cm. Moreover, a questionnaire of baseline characteristics and the factor associated with sarcopenic obesity was collected, including age, years since menopause, history of menopausal hormone therapy, underlying diseases, medications, nutritional status assessed by the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), and physical activity assessed by The Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ). Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to examine the associated factors with sarcopenic obesity. The prevalence of sarcopenic obesity was 13.3%, and sarcopenia was present in 28.63%, while osteoporosis affected 39.91% of the participants. Sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity were significantly associated with osteoporosis (odds ratio (OR) 3.05; 95% CI, 1.69-5.49; p < 0.05 and OR 2.65; 95% CI, 1.23-5.68; p < 0.05, respectively). In univariate and stepwise logistic regression analyses, a lower MNA score was significantly associated with an increased risk of sarcopenic obesity. Specifically, participants with an MNA score of 8-11 had an OR of 2.26; 95% CI,1.04-4.92; p < 0.04, while those with a score <8 exhibited a markedly elevated risk (OR 25.6; 95% CI, 1.04-4.92; p < 0.05). Conversely, the use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) was identified as a significant protective factor against sarcopenic obesity (OR 0.29; 95% CI, 0.10-0.79; p < 0.05). Both sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity are linked to osteoporosis.

40569470,Differential response of patient-derived primary glioblastoma cells to metabolic and adhesion inhibitors.,"This study aims to investigate the cellular response of Glioblastoma (GBM) to adhesion and metabolic inhibitors, focusing on cell migration and matrix adhesion properties. GBM is the most common incurable brain tumor. Despite decades of research into GBM's chemical and molecular classification, identifying mechanisms of drug resistance has been challenging. Studies on inhibitors targeting cancer cell migration and proliferation rarely consider the heterogeneous migration properties among cells, which may impact patient responses to treatment. In this work, tissue samples were obtained from spatially distinct locations with different 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) fluorescent intensities-including strongly fluorescent tumor cores, a weakly fluorescent tumor rim, and non-fluorescent tumor margins. These samples were previously shown to be associated with significantly different motility and adhesion properties. We tested the response of tumor cells to adhesion and metabolic inhibitors using metabolic MTT and Cell Titer Glo viability assays, respectively. We also monitored cell survival using time-lapse microscopy, while culturing them on low-modulus polydimethylsiloxane (representing the stiffness of brain tissue). Metabolic viability assays revealed substantial heterogeneity in drug potency across cells from different regions of the tumor. Highly fluorescent tumor core cells were significantly more resistant to an F0F1 ATP synthase inhibitor (Gboxin), and a FAK inhibitor (GSK2256098), while their proliferation ceased post-treatment in vitro. In contrast, cells derived from non-fluorescent tumor margins exhibited higher potency for the ATP synthase inhibitor (Gboxin), but their proliferation persisted post-treatment. Our study demonstrates a correlation between the adhesive and migration properties of cells and their sensitivity to therapeutics in different regions of the tumor within individual patients and between patients with GBM.",Clinical and experimental medicine,2025.0,Rasha Rezk; Fikret Basar; John Mediavillo; Rebecca Donaldson; Colin Watts; Kristian Franze; Alexandre J Kabla,study aim investigate cellular response glioblastoma gbm adhesion metabolic inhibitor focus cell migration matrix adhesion property gbm common incurable brain tumor despite decade research gbm chemical molecular classification identify mechanism drug resistance challenge study inhibitor target cancer cell migration proliferation rarely consider heterogeneous migration property cell impact patient response treatment work tissue sample obtain spatially distinct location different 5 aminolevulinic acid 5 ala fluorescent intensity include strongly fluorescent tumor core weakly fluorescent tumor rim non fluorescent tumor margin sample previously show associate significantly different motility adhesion property test response tumor cell adhesion metabolic inhibitor metabolic mtt cell titer glo viability assay respectively monitor cell survival time lapse microscopy culture low modulus polydimethylsiloxane represent stiffness brain tissue metabolic viability assay reveal substantial heterogeneity drug potency cell different region tumor highly fluorescent tumor core cell significantly resistant f0f1 atp synthase inhibitor gboxin fak inhibitor gsk2256098 proliferation cease post treatment vitro contrast cell derive non fluorescent tumor margin exhibit high potency atp synthase inhibitor gboxin proliferation persist post treatment study demonstrate correlation adhesive migration property cell sensitivity therapeutic different region tumor individual patient patient gbm
40569469,Mitochondrial pathology in inflammatory myopathies: a marker of worse clinical outcome.,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is well documented in inclusion body myositis (IBM), but its role in non-IBM myositis remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinical significance of mitochondrial pathology in non-IBM myositis and to assess its potential role as a marker for disease progression towards IBM, treatment response, and clinical outcomes. Muscle biopsies from 850 patients with inflammatory myopathy (IM) across 6 neuromuscular centers in Italy, France, and Germany were retrospectively analyzed. Inclusion required meeting diagnostic criteria for definite adult IM, mitochondrial pathology (age-exceeding numbers of COX-negative fibers), and exclusion of definite IBM according to Hilton-Jones 2013 criteria. The percentage of COX-negative fibers was quantified, correlated with clinical outcomes, and compared with myositis control cases without relevant signs of mitochondrial alterations. Twenty-five patients with non-IBM myositis and mitochondrial abnormalities were identified. These patients, predominantly women (68%), had a mean onset age of 58.8 years. Polymyositis with mitochondrial pathology (PM-Mito) and nonspecific myositis (NSM) were the most prevalent subtypes (72%). The mean percentage of COX-negative fibers was 3% (0.25-8.5%) in these patients. The presence of mitochondrial pathology was associated with treatment refractoriness and worse clinical outcome evaluated based on residual muscle weakness and the level of independence (p < 0.005). A higher percentage of COX-negative fibers also correlated with poorer clinical outcomes (p = 0.031). Four patients, initially diagnosed with PM-Mito and NSM, progressed to definite IBM. Mitochondrial dysfunction represents a key element informing about disease severity and poor clinical outcomes in non-IBM myositis.

40569433,Psychological well-being and mental health risks in deaf and hard of hearing youth: a systematic review.,"This systematic review aimed to assess the mental health of children and adolescents who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing (DHH), including those with moderate to profound levels of hearing loss, exploring factors influencing their psychological well-being and social functioning. Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted in nine databases (Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, etc.) up to January 2025. Empirical qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods studies published in English were included, with 46 studies selected after screening. Study quality was assessed using a 14-criteria scoring system. Data extraction was performed by the first author and validated by co-authors. A total of 46 studies with 22,859 participants (ages 6-21) were included. Findings revealed that individuals who are DHH or moderate to profound hearing loss experience higher rates of internalizing disorders, such as anxiety and depression, compared to hearing peers. Social exclusion, communication barriers, and stigma were significant risk factors. Mainstream schools exacerbated mental health challenges, whereas specialized schools provided a supportive environment. Early diagnosis and intervention, especially cochlear implants, improved psychosocial development. Communication proficiency, especially sign language, positively impacted quality of life and mental health. Parental involvement and targeted interventions helped mitigate behavioral challenges and executive functioning deficits.

40569385,Contribution of glutamatergic projections to neurons in the nonhuman primate substantia nigra pars reticulata for reactive inhibition.,"The basal ganglia play a crucial role in action selection by facilitating desired movements and suppressing unwanted ones. The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), a key output nucleus, facilitates movement through disinhibition of the superior colliculus (SC). However, its role in action suppression, particularly in primates, remains less clear. We investigated whether individual SNr neurons in three male macaque monkeys bidirectionally modulate their activity to both facilitate and suppress actions and examined the role of glutamatergic inputs in suppression. Monkeys performed a sequential choice task, selecting or rejecting visually presented targets. Electrophysiological recordings showed that SNr neurons decreased firing rates during target selection and increased firing rates during rejection, demonstrating bidirectional modulation. Pharmacological blockade of glutamatergic inputs to the lateral SNr disrupted saccadic control and impaired suppression of reflexive saccades, providing causal evidence for the role of excitatory input in behavioral inhibition. These findings suggest that glutamatergic projections, potentially originating from sources including the subthalamic nucleus, contribute to the increased SNr activity during action suppression. Our results highlight conserved basal ganglia mechanisms across species and offer insights into the neural substrates of action selection and suppression in primates, with implications for understanding disorders such as Parkinson's disease.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2025.0,Atsushi Yoshida; Okihide Hikosaka,basal ganglia play crucial role action selection facilitate desire movement suppress unwanted one substantia nigra par reticulata snr key output nucleus facilitate movement disinhibition superior colliculus sc role action suppression particularly primate remain clear investigate individual snr neuron male macaque monkey bidirectionally modulate activity facilitate suppress action examine role glutamatergic input suppression monkeys perform sequential choice task select reject visually present target electrophysiological recording show snr neuron decrease fire rate target selection increase firing rate rejection demonstrate bidirectional modulation pharmacological blockade glutamatergic input lateral snr disrupt saccadic control impaired suppression reflexive saccade provide causal evidence role excitatory input behavioral inhibition finding suggest glutamatergic projection potentially originate source include subthalamic nucleus contribute increase snr activity action suppression result highlight conserve basal ganglia mechanism specie offer insight neural substrate action selection suppression primate implication understand disorder parkinson disease
40569372,Neurologic and psychiatric disorders as risk factors following hip arthroplasty: results from the German arthroplasty registry.,"We investigated whether neurologic and psychiatric disorders (ICD-10 F00-F99, G00-G99) increase postoperative complications and mortality after hip arthroplasty and identified subgroups with distinct complication patterns, including dislocations, loosening, fractures, and elevated mortality. We analyzed 190,340 primary cementless hip arthroplasties from the German Arthroplasty Registry (2012-2024). Patients with relevant diagnoses were compared to matched controls (1:1 Mahalanobis distance) across subgroups F00-F99 and G00-G99, adjusting for age, sex, BMI, Elixhauser Index, and arthroplasty type. Primary endpoints were implant survival (time to revision) and all-cause mortality over up to eight years. Revision causes including periprosthetic fracture, infection, dislocation, loosening, and others were systematically recorded. Most subgroups showed significantly higher revision rates (p < 0.0001 for F00-F09, F10-F19, F30-F39, G20-G26, G40-G47, G60-G64). Mortality was also significantly higher (p < 0.0001 for F00-F09, F10-F19, F30-F39). Schizophrenia (F20-F29) increased revision (p < 0.0001) and mortality (p < 0.0001). Organic mental disorders (F00-F09) showed markedly elevated revision and mortality rates, with more frequent dislocations and fractures (p < 0.0001). Extrapyramidal disorders (G20-G26) mainly increased dislocation risk (p = 0.00032), while degenerative diseases (G30-G32) raised mortality (p < 0.0001). Episodic/paroxysmal disorders (G40-G47) increased loosening (p = 0.0041) and revision (p < 0.0001). Polyneuropathies (G60-G64) were linked to joint instability and dislocations (p = 0.0008). Neurologic and psychiatric disorders significantly elevate revision and mortality risks following hip arthroplasty.

40569358,Emerging Insights into the Pathogenic Mechanisms of Dravet Syndrome.,"Dravet syndrome (DS) is a rare monogenic developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) most frequently caused by SCN1A gene mutations that lead to Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 sodium channel haploinsufficiency. DS is now recognized as a multisystem disorder with widespread developmental consequences that go beyond epilepsy. Indeed, children with DS often exhibit cognitive impairment, motor and speech delays, and neuropsychiatric comorbidities such as anxiety, attention deficits, and autistic traits. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is also frequent. This complex phenotype underscores the need for multidisciplinary care approaches and novel pharmacological therapies. Mechanistically, recent studies in DS mouse models revealed a more complex scenario than previously thought. According to recent works, some well described neuronal defects in DS are restored during development while other impairments persist throughout life. Furthermore, evidence reveal which mechanisms are involved in cognitive impairments but not in seizures. Recently approved drugs such as cannabidiol (CBD) and fenfluramine (FFA) also help to better understand the mechanisms underlying the different disease symptoms. Here, we review most recent advances on the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in DS complex phenotype. We also propose that in DS, one of the main consequences of the defective GABAergic signalling during development is to impair glial cells maturation and functions, including their role in synaptogenesis, synaptic refinement and inflammatory responses. Developing new tools to restore GABAergic signalling and/or glial functions may pave the way for new more effective treatments in Dravet Syndrome.",Neurochemical research,2025.0,Nicole Tonesi; Elisa Berselli; Sara Ben Abid; Giulia Puja; Gabriele Losi,dravet syndrome ds rare monogenic developmental epileptic encephalopathy dee frequently cause scn1a gene mutation lead na < sub > v</sub>1.1 sodium channel haploinsufficiency ds recognize multisystem disorder widespread developmental consequence epilepsy child ds exhibit cognitive impairment motor speech delay neuropsychiatric comorbiditie anxiety attention deficit autistic trait sudden unexpected death epilepsy sudep frequent complex phenotype underscore need multidisciplinary care approach novel pharmacological therapy mechanistically recent study ds mouse model reveal complex scenario previously think accord recent work describe neuronal defect ds restore development impairment persist life furthermore evidence reveal mechanism involve cognitive impairment seizure recently approve drug cannabidiol cbd fenfluramine ffa help well understand mechanism underlie different disease symptom review recent advance cellular molecular mechanism involve ds complex phenotype propose ds main consequence defective gabaergic signal development impair glial cell maturation function include role synaptogenesis synaptic refinement inflammatory response develop new tool restore gabaergic signal and/or glial function pave way new effective treatment dravet syndrome
40569355,"A companion to the preclinical common data elements for rigor, reproducibility and transparency in basic and translational epilepsy research. A report of the TASK3-WG1A: Pharmacology Working Group of the ILAE/AES Joint Translational Task Force.","Rigorous and transparent procedures in preclinical epilepsy research studies are important to permit assessing the reproducibility of their findings and derisk their translation into the clinic. The General Pharmacology Working Group of the ILAE/AES Task Force (TASK3-WG1A) developed common data elements (CDEs) addressing rigor and transparency and organized the CDEs into a case report form (CRF) to provide guidance on study planning, conduct, analysis, and reporting. CDEs specifying the type of study, use of inclusion-exclusion criteria, quantitative methods, randomization, blinding, and masking were developed and defined. This companion paper provides additional information and interpretation on the use of the rigor and transparency CDEs to assist preclinical investigators. Adoption of these CDEs and CRF will enhance data quality and transparent reporting to improve the reuse of preclinical data sets and the successful translation of preclinical epilepsy research.

40569353,Effectiveness of Youth and Young Adult Peer Support in Mental Health Services: A Systematic Review.,"Serious workforce shortages in youth mental health widen the gap between demand and use, and exacerbate health disparities. A strategy to address this is training and integrating youth and young adult (Y/YA) peers to deliver services. This paper reviews international scientific studies on Y/YA services targeting mental health conditions or health promotion. We applied systematic criteria including controlled designs (RCTs or quasi-experimental), active intervention delivered by a young person, key search terms, and peer-reviewed publication between 2012 and 2023. The review yielded 32 studies meeting criteria, encompassing six domains: eating disorders, health promotion, depression/anxiety, suicidal risk, serious mental illness (SMI) and ""other."" The most consistent evidence for effectiveness was for eating disorders; findings in the other domains were mixed. Training manuals, fidelity measurement, reporting of demographic data, and consistency in outcome measurement were largely absent, limiting both replicability and generalizability.

40569339,Reversibility of neurotechnological interventions: conceptual and ethical issues.,"Currently, we have developed a range of neurotechnologies to intervene in neurological and psychiatric disorders, with some of these interventions considered reversible. However, the term ""reversibility,"" although widely used in clinical and research contexts, remains ambiguously defined, and is often applied inconsistently in different contexts, which may pose ethical risks for patients. In fact, reversibility can be classified into three categories: ontological reversibility (including structural, functional, and psychological reversibility), methodological reversibility (including current and future methodological reversibility), and ethical reversibility (including autonomy, well-being, and harm reversibility). However, each of these forms of reversibility has inherent problems when applied in clinical settings. To ensure that patients are fully informed about the reversibility of neurotechnological interventions, we should adopt a perspective of practical reversibility to address this issue, improving the informed consent procedures for neurotechnological interventions, and clarifying the actual needs of patients regarding reversibility in terms of individual conditions, technological consequences, and value assessments.","Medicine, health care, and philosophy",2025.0,Junjie Yang,currently develop range neurotechnologie intervene neurological psychiatric disorder intervention consider reversible term reversibility widely clinical research contexts remain ambiguously define apply inconsistently different contexts pose ethical risk patient fact reversibility classify category ontological reversibility include structural functional psychological reversibility methodological reversibility include current future methodological reversibility ethical reversibility include autonomy harm reversibility form reversibility inherent problem apply clinical setting ensure patient fully inform reversibility neurotechnological intervention adopt perspective practical reversibility address issue improve informed consent procedure neurotechnological intervention clarify actual need patient reversibility term individual condition technological consequence value assessment

German version].,"With the introduction of the 11th revision of the World Health Organization International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11), structural and content-related adjustments to the diagnostic guidelines for anxiety disorders were made, which are presented in this review article. Previously classified as ""phobic disorders"" and ""other anxiety disorders"" within the group ""neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders"", in ICD-11 ""anxiety- or fear-related disorders"" now constitute a separate group. The core diagnoses of agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder are retained, with the modification that agoraphobia and panic disorder can now be diagnosed separately and comorbidly. Within the framework of the lifespan perspective, separation anxiety disorder and selective mutism have been moved to the group ""anxiety- or fear-related disorders"". The diagnosis ""mixed anxiety and depressive disorder"" is now classified as ""mixed depressive and anxiety disorder"" in the group ""affective disorders"". In accordance with the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‑5), it is possible to code isolated panic attacks in addition to other mental or somatic disorders. Overall, ICD-11 follows the DSM‑5 classification of anxiety- and fear-related disorders in many respects.

40569131,Occupational pesticide exposure and cognitive impairment among adult farmers in northern Thailand.,"Thai farmers are directly exposed to pesticides, which may result in adverse effects including cognitive impairment. The aim of this study was to examine the association between occupational pesticide exposure and cognitive decline among adult farmers in northern Thailand. This cross-sectional study included 303 pesticide-using farmers over the age of 50 from Doi Tao District in Chiang Mai Province. Pesticide exposure score was calculated using an algorithm that considered personal protective equipment (PPE) scores and exposure intensity scores, as well as lifetime application days. The scores were classified as high or low exposure based on their median. The Thai version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test was used to assess cognitive function. The mean age of adult farmers was 58.74 years. The prevalence of cognitive impairment was 93.7%, with an average score of 19.6. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient showed that the MoCA score was adversely correlated with lifetime application days (r<sub>s</sub> = -0.145), PPE score (r<sub>s</sub> = -0.163), exposure intensity score (r<sub>s</sub> = -0.184), and pesticide exposure score (r<sub>s</sub> = -0.225). Linear regression revealed that high exposed farmers had significantly lower MoCA scores than low exposed farmers, as measured by PPE score (B = -0.75; 95% CI: -1.46, -0.05), exposure intensity score (B = -0.97; 95% CI: -1.66, -0.27), and pesticide exposure score (B = -0.77; 95% CI: -1.47, -0.06), after controlling for sex, age, education, income sufficiency, and body mass index. Thai farmers are at risk of cognitive impairment linked to occupational pesticide exposure, depending on their PPE use and exposure intensity.

40569125,In Vivo Stability of Electronic Intraocular Lens Implant for Corneal Blindness.,"Electronic technology can add new function to intraocular lenses, including the treatment of corneal blindness. However, it is not known if such an implant can be stably implanted within a living eye over time. This study investigates the long-term stability and safety of an intraocular lens-shaped implant with an embedded electronic microdisplay for potential use in treating corneal blindness. Five intraocular implants containing a nonfunctional microdisplay and projection optic were surgically implanted into five rabbits after removal of their crystalline lenses. This blocks the natural pathway of light into the eye. The rabbits were monitored over 6 months with photography and biometry to assess the centration and axial stability of the implants. All implants were successfully implanted and remained stable over the 6-month trial. The average distance from the cornea center was 0.868 ± 0.442 mm at 1 month and 0.851 ± 0.591 mm at 6 months. Anterior chamber depth, representing axial stability, was 4.362 ± 0.213 mm at 1 month and 4.351 ± 0.218 mm at 6 months. While posterior capsular opacification and iris adhesions were observed, no major complications occurred. This study is the first to demonstrate long-term stability of an intraocular lens-shaped implant containing an electronic display and optical system. These findings suggest that such implants are viable and safe, supporting their potential as a treatment for corneal blindness and other broader applications.

40569104,Baicalein Alleviates Lithium-Pilocarpine-Induced Status Epilepticus by Regulating DNMT1/GABRD Pathway in Rats.,"Epilepsy is a common disease of the nervous system. Recent advances in epigenetics have revealed DNA methylation as a key mechanism in epilepsy pathogenesis, particularly through dysregulation of GABAergic signaling. Baicalein has been shown to have anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects. However, its epigenetic regulatory effects on GABA receptor function remain unexplored. The status epilepticus (SE) model was induced by lithium chloride-pilocarpine (LiCl-PILO) in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The rats were divided into control group, epileptic SE group and baicalein intervention group. Morris water maze (MWM) test, Nissl staining, immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect cognitive functions and neuronal damage. Online sites, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and western blotting were used to identify DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)-mediated methylation of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunit delta (GABRD) promoter region. Baicalein treatment significantly prolonged the latency of SE onset and seizure onset, and improved the development of epilepsy. Meanwhile, baicalein improved the cognitive impairment in rats induced by LiCl-PILO. After treatment with baicalein, a sustained elevation in the number of neurons and NeuN levels was observed, along with a decrease in the contents of tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1) in the hippocampus. Mechanistically, baicalein interacted with DNMT1 to suppress GABRD promoter region methylation, thus increasing GABRD protein level in the hippocampus of rats induced by LiCl-PILO. This study identifies DNMT1/GABRD axis as a novel epigenetic target for epilepsy intervention.

40568975,Follicle on the Roof: Tertiary Lymphoid Structures in Central Nervous System Autoimmunity.,"Leptomeningeal tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) have emerged as a relatively common pathological feature of autoimmune disease, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and particularly in people with progressive and nonremitting MS. These ectopic lymphoid aggregates, observed in the leptomeninges adjacent to so-called ""Type 3"" sub-pial cortical lesions, are associated with more severe gray matter damage and worse clinical outcomes. Mouse models of MS that recapitulate TLS formation in the central nervous system (CNS) have provided critical insights into the mechanisms driving their development and maintenance. In these models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) initiation of TLS is facilitated by Th17 cells, which promote chronic inflammation via cytokines such as IL-17 and GM-CSF. The cell surface expression of lymphotoxin-α and lymphotoxin-β heterotrimers (LTαβ) on lymphocytes, including Th17 cells, elaborates the organization of ectopic lymphoid tissues via LTβR signaling on radio-resistant stromal cells and resident fibroblasts. Ultimately a pro-inflammatory environment characterized by cytokines such as IL-17 and GM-CSF promotes the recruitment of neutrophils which produce proteases and chemokines that sustain a pro-inflammatory milieu. Emerging EAE data suggest that disrupting TLS organization or targeting key pathways involved in their maintenance could represent promising strategies for modulating chronic CNS inflammation in MS. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating TLS dynamics is therefore critical for the development of therapies aimed at halting or reversing nonremitting MS disease.",Immunological reviews,2025.0,Michelle Zuo; Angela A Wang; Jennifer L Gommerman,leptomeningeal tertiary lymphoid structure tls emerge relatively common pathological feature autoimmune disease include multiple sclerosis ms particularly people progressive nonremitte ms ectopic lymphoid aggregate observe leptomeninge adjacent call type 3 sub pial cortical lesion associate severe gray matter damage bad clinical outcome mouse model ms recapitulate tls formation central nervous system cns provide critical insight mechanism drive development maintenance model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis eae initiation tls facilitate th17 cell promote chronic inflammation cytokine il-17 gm csf cell surface expression lymphotoxin α lymphotoxin β heterotrimers ltαβ lymphocyte include th17 cell elaborate organization ectopic lymphoid tissue ltβr signal radio resistant stromal cell resident fibroblast ultimately pro inflammatory environment characterize cytokine il-17 gm csf promote recruitment neutrophil produce protease chemokine sustain pro inflammatory milieu emerge eae datum suggest disrupt tls organization target key pathway involve maintenance represent promising strategy modulate chronic cns inflammation ms understand cellular molecular mechanism regulate tls dynamic critical development therapy aim halt reverse nonremitte ms disease
40568881,The role of systemic inflammation in the formation and rupture of intracranial aneurysms in moyamoya disease: a retrospective cohort study.,"Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) and their rupture are serious complications in patients with Moyamoya disease (MMD). However, specific risk factors for IA formation and rupture in MMD remain underexplored. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 450 MMD patients, evaluating the prevalence and characteristics of IAs. We analysed peripheral blood markers, including white blood cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, platelet count, and calculated SII-related biomarkers (SII, NLR, PLR, MLR, GLR). Among the 450 MMD patients, 57 (12.67%) had a total of 73 IAs. Unilateral MMD patients had a significantly higher risk of IAs and multiple IAs compared to bilateral MMD patients (OR 1.97, 95% CI [1.02 - 3.71], <i>p</i> = 0.042; OR 5.76, 95% CI [1.16 - 23.55], <i>p</i> = 0.032). Aspirin use was associated with a lower incidence of IAs (OR 0.34, 95% CI [0.17 - 0.70], <i>p</i> = 0.002). The SII, NLR, GLR, MLR, and PLR were significantly elevated in patients with IAs compared to those without.

40568837,Mitochondrial protein nmd regulates lipophagy and general autophagy during development.,"Lipophagy engulfs lipid droplets and delivers them to lysosomes for degradation. We found that lipophagy levels were low in most fly tissues, except for the prothoracic gland (PG) during larval development. Therefore, we performed a small-scale screening in the PG to identify regulators of lipophagy. We discovered that the loss of <i>nmd</i>, a gene encoding a mitochondrial AAA-ATPase, led to developmental failure and reduced lipophagy in the PG. Further studies indicated that <i>nmd</i> was not only required for lipophagy but also essential for general macroautophagy/autophagy in both PG and fat body tissues. Autophagy was induced but blocked at the autophagosome-lysosome fusion stage upon nmd reduction. Additionally, nmd interacted with mitochondrial protein import machinery, such as Tom20, Tom40, and the import cargo, such as Idh. Loss of <i>nmd</i> decreased protein import into mitochondria. Similar to the loss of <i>nmd</i>, reduction of Tom20 or Tom40 also resulted in reduced lipophagy in the PG.

While GBA1 variants are a major risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), most patients with GD never develop parkinsonism. To understand factors impacting PD penetrance in patients with GD by comparing induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived dopaminergic neurons (DANs) from GD siblings discordant for PD. iPSCs, reprogrammed from two different sibling pairs where both siblings had GD but only one developed PD, were differentiated into DANs. In one family, DAN enrichment was achieved via geneticin selection and proteomic evaluations were performed. GCase and lipid substrate levels were similar in GD and GD/PD DANs. After geneticin selection, proteomic analysis of the enriched DANs showed upregulation of molecular chaperones in the GD/PD line. PD discordance in both sets of GD siblings did not correlate with GCase or lipid substrate levels in DANs, implicating the involvement of other modifiers. Published 2025.

40568753,Translational minimal physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for transferrin receptor-mediated brain delivery of antibodies.,"Successful development of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for the treatment of central nervous system disorders has been challenging due to their minimal ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), resulting in poor brain exposure. Bispecific antibodies (bsAb) that bind to transmembrane protein expressed at the BBB, such as the transferrin receptor (TfR), have shown enhanced brain exposure in rodents and non-human primate (NHP) due to receptor-mediated transcytosis. However, it remains unclear how preclinical findings translate to humans. Moreover, optimal TfR binding affinity remains a subject of debate. Model-informed drug discovery and development is a powerful approach that has been successfully used to support research and development. The goal of this analysis was to expand a published brain minimal physiologically based pharmacokinetic (mPBPK) model to investigate the optimal TfR binding affinity for maximal brain delivery in NHP and to facilitate prediction of the PK of anti-TfR bsAbs in humans from NHP data. Literature data for plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain exposure after administration of non-TfR mAbs and monovalent bsAbs with respect to TfR in NHP were used to develop the TfR mPBPK model. Clinical validation using human PK data from plasma and CSF for the monovalent anti-TfR bsAb trontinemab demonstrated good predictive performance without major model recalibration. The availability of the TfR mPBPK model is envisaged to provide better understanding of the relationship between TfR binding affinity, dose, and brain exposure, which would lead to more robust selection of lead candidates and efficacious dosing regimens.",mAbs,2025.0,Morris Muliaditan; Tamara J van Steeg; Lindsay B Avery; Wei Sun; Timothy R Hammond; Diana Hijdra; Siak-Leng Choi; Nikhil Pillai; Nina C Leksa; Panteleimon D Mavroudis,successful development monoclonal antibody mabs treatment central nervous system disorder challenge minimal ability cross blood brain barrier bbb result poor brain exposure bispecific antibodie bsab bind transmembrane protein express bbb transferrin receptor tfr show enhance brain exposure rodent non human primate nhp receptor mediate transcytosis remain unclear preclinical finding translate human optimal tfr bind affinity remain subject debate model inform drug discovery development powerful approach successfully support research development goal analysis expand publish brain minimal physiologically base pharmacokinetic mpbpk model investigate optimal tfr bind affinity maximal brain delivery nhp facilitate prediction pk anti tfr bsabs human nhp datum literature datum plasma cerebrospinal fluid csf brain exposure administration non tfr mabs monovalent bsabs respect tfr nhp develop tfr mpbpk model clinical validation human pk datum plasma csf monovalent anti tfr bsab trontinemab demonstrate good predictive performance major model recalibration availability tfr mpbpk model envisage provide well understanding relationship tfr bind affinity dose brain exposure lead robust selection lead candidate efficacious dosing regimen
40568737,Male and Female Healthcare Trajectories in Autism: Are There Any Differences Considering Age at Diagnosis and Intellectual or Developmental Disabilities Status?,"The aim of this study was to compare the healthcare trajectories (HCTs) 2 years after a first diagnosis of autism according to sex, age at diagnosis, and intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDD) status. This is a retrospective cohort study using health administrative data from Québec, Canada. The cohort included all individuals with a first diagnosis of autism registered by a physician between April 2012 and March 2015. HCTs were stratified by sex, presence of IDD, and age at diagnosis (youth, adult), and analyzed using state sequence analysis across healthcare settings, providers, and reasons for use. Our cohort included 5289 individuals, 76.6% were male, and 26.3% were adults at the time of diagnosis. The healthcare use decreased slightly over time, though intensity was higher in females. Sex differences in HCTs were strongly influenced by IDD status and age at diagnosis. While no significant sex differences were observed in HCTs for individuals with IDD diagnosed with autism in adulthood, the psychiatric condition profiles showed notable differences between males and females. Hospital days nearly doubled for females diagnosed in childhood compared to males, while males with IDD diagnosed with autism in childhood and males without IDD diagnosed in adulthood had fewer physical illness visits.

40568709,Neurodevelopmental disorders and gut-brain interactions: exploring the therapeutic potential of pycnogenol through microbial-metabolic-neural networks.,"Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), characterized by cognitive impairments and behavioral abnormalities, represent a clinically diverse group of conditions typically emerging during childhood or adolescence. Major subtypes encompass autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and epilepsy. The pathogenesis of these disorders involves multifactorial interactions between genetic susceptibility (<i>Shank3</i> mutations in ASD), environmental triggers (prenatal toxins), neurotransmitter dysregulation (dopamine (GA) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) systems) and immune dysregulation. Growing research highlights the gut-brain axis disruption as a potential contributor to NDDs pathophysiology, though systematic evaluation of therapeutic approaches targeting this axis and related gastrointestinal comorbidities (GIDs) remains limited. This review comprehensively examines the pathological mechanisms underlying ADHD, ASD, and epilepsy, while analyzing the reciprocal relationship between gut-brain axis dysregulation and GID manifestations in NDDs. Notably, abnormal activation of key signaling pathways including NF-κB, MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR is strongly associated with the pathogenesis of NDDs. We further propose pycnogenol (PYC), a polyphenol extract of pine bark, as a natural compound with multiple bioactivities such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, can directly or indirectly affect the function of the gut-brain axis by regulating the structure of the intestinal microbial community (increasing the abundance of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> and butyric acid-producing bacteria) and its metabolites, providing a new strategy for the treatment of NDDs.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2025.0,Ling Chen; Zhiqiang Li; Yuying Fan,neurodevelopmental disorder ndd characterize cognitive impairment behavioral abnormality represent clinically diverse group condition typically emerge childhood adolescence major subtype encompass autism spectrum disorder asd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd epilepsy pathogenesis disorder involve multifactorial interaction genetic susceptibility < > shank3</i > mutation asd environmental trigger prenatal toxin neurotransmitter dysregulation dopamine ga γ aminobutyric acid gaba system immune dysregulation grow research highlight gut brain axis disruption potential contributor ndd pathophysiology systematic evaluation therapeutic approach target axis related gastrointestinal comorbiditie gids remain limited review comprehensively examine pathological mechanism underlie adhd asd epilepsy analyze reciprocal relationship gut brain axis dysregulation gid manifestation ndd notably abnormal activation key signal pathway include nf κb mapk pi3k akt mtor strongly associate pathogenesis ndd propose pycnogenol pyc polyphenol extract pine bark natural compound multiple bioactivitie anti inflammatory antioxidant directly indirectly affect function gut brain axis regulate structure intestinal microbial community increase abundance < > akkermansia muciniphila</i > butyric acid produce bacteria metabolite provide new strategy treatment ndd
40568592,"PANoptosis in neurological disorders: mechanisms, implications, and therapeutic potential.","PANoptosis is a unique form of programmed cell death (PCD) that has the combined main features of pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, but cannot be fully explained by any single pathway alone. Among all the influencing factors in PANoptosis, the activation and assembly of PANoptosomes are the most critical. To date, four distinct PANoptosomes have been identified: Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), and nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat-containing receptor 12 (NLRP12) PANoptosomes. Currently, PANoptosis is a promising target for central nervous system (CNS) disorders treatment. Understanding its mechanisms will facilitate its therapeutic application. This review introduces the concept of PANoptosis, its detection methods, the molecular composition and regulation of PANoptosomes, and the role of ninjurin 1 (NINJ1), a new ""executor"" in PANoptosis.

40568579,Alterations in peripheral blood immune cell profiles of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder across different phases and after B cell depletion therapy.,"Peripheral blood immune cell profiles of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) are still unclear under different disease states and after B cell depletion therapy. Moreover, NMOSD is often confused with multiple sclerosis (MS) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease (MOGAD). The study aims to illustrate peripheral blood immune cell profiles of NMOSD under different disease states, after B cell depletion therapy, and compared with MS and MOGAD. This study included 76 NMOSD patients, 20 MS patients, and 12 MOGAD patients in the acute phase, along with 37 controls whose sex and age were matched with NMOSD patients. Forty-two of 76 patients with acute NMOSD were followed in remission, of whom 13, 15, and 11 patients received rituximab treatment, inebilizumab treatment, or conventional immunosuppressive therapies alone, respectively. The levels of diverse peripheral blood immune cells were measured by blood routine examination and flow cytometry. Distinctions among groups were analyzed using statistical methods. Compared with controls and NMOSD patients in remission, there was an elevation in the levels of neutrophils, platelets, platelet/lymphocyte ratio, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and systemic inflammation index in acute NMOSD patients, while a decline was observed in the levels of lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, CD3+ T cells, CD3+CD4+ T cells, and CD4/CD8 ratio. NMOSD had increased levels of platelets and platelet/lymphocyte ratio, and decreased levels of eosinophils, basophils, CD4/CD8 ratio, and CD3+CD4+ T cells compared with MS. NMOSD had decreased levels of eosinophils, basophils, and CD19+ B cells, along with elevated platelet/lymphocyte ratio compared with MOGAD. After rituximab treatment, not only did CD19+ B cell level decrease, but eosinophil counts also increased. After inebilizumab treatment, not only did CD19+ B cell level decrease, but also the ratios of CD3+ T cells and CD3+CD8+ T cells increased. The quantity and ratios of eosinophils in rituximab group surpassed those in inebilizumab group. Peripheral blood immune cell profiles of acute NMOSD patients showed widespread distinctions compared to those of remission NMOSD patients, acute MS patients, acute MOGAD patients, and controls, as well as after differential therapies.

40568566,Associations between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and computed tomography-defined low muscle mass in older adults and sex-related differences.,"The associations between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and the risk of sarcopenia are inconclusive. This study aimed to investigate the association between HDL-C levels and chest computed tomography (CT)-defined low muscle mass in older adults and its sex-related differences. This prospective study involved 1995 participants aged ≥50 years. The muscle area of the bilateral erector spinae muscles was measured at the T12 level on a single CT image. Linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the effects of related factors on muscle area. Multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis were used to analyze the relationships between HDL-C quartile and low muscle mass in all participants and in the male and female subgroups. An increased HDL-C level was associated with a greater risk of lower muscle area overall (β=-1.91, 95% CI: -2.95 to -0.87) and in male participants (β=-3.16, 95% CI: -4.70- -1.61), whereas no significant difference was found in the female subgroup (<i>P</i> > 0.05). A higher continuous HDL-C level was associated with a greater risk of low muscle mass in all participants (odds ratio (OR) =2.28, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.51-3.45) and in the male subgroup (OR=3.28, 95% CI: 1.84-5.87) after adjustment for confounders, whereas no significant difference was found in the female subgroup (P>0.05). Furthermore, the RCS model showed similar results regarding the relationship between HDL-C levels and the risk of low muscle mass. Higher HDL-C levels were associated with a significantly greater risk of low muscle mass, particularly in older male adults.

We systematically quantified discrepancies between self- and caregiver-reported apathy in 335 patients with a variety of diagnoses, such as frontotemporal dementia (behavioural variant and semantic dementia subtypes), Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, Alzheimer's disease dementia, mild cognitive impairment, small vessel cerebrovascular disease, subjective cognitive decline and autoimmune encephalitis. Using the Apathy Motivation Index (AMI) and its analogous caregiver version (AMI-CG), we found that caregiver-reported apathy consistently exceeded self-reported levels across all conditions. Moreover, self-reported apathy accounted for only 14.1% of the variance in caregiver ratings. This apathy reporting discrepancy was most pronounced in conditions associated with impaired insight, such as behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, and was significantly correlated with cognitive impairment. Deficits in memory and fluency explained an additional 11.2% of the variance in caregiver-reported apathy. Specifically, executive function deficits (e.g. indexed by fluency) and memory impairments may contribute to behavioural inertia or recall of it. These findings highlight the need to integrate patient and caregiver perspectives in apathy assessments, especially for conditions with prominent cognitive impairment. To improve diagnostic accuracy and deepen our understanding of apathy across neurological disorders, we highlight the need for adapted apathy assessment strategies that account for cognitive impairment particularly in individuals with insight or memory deficits. Understanding the cognitive mechanisms underpinning discordant apathy reporting in dementia might help inform targeted clinical interventions and reduce caregiver burden.",Brain communications,2025.0,Sijia Zhao; Anna Scholcz; Matthew A Rouse; Verena S Klar; Akke Ganse-Dumrath; Sofia Toniolo; M John Broulidakis; Matthew A Lambon Ralph; James B Rowe; Peter Garrard; Sian Thompson; Sarosh R Irani; Sanjay G Manohar; Masud Husain,apathy prevalent persistent neuropsychiatric syndrome neurological disorder significantly impact patient caregiver systematically quantify discrepancy self- caregiver report apathy 335 patient variety diagnosis frontotemporal dementia behavioural variant semantic dementia subtype parkinson disease parkinson disease dementia dementia lewy body alzheimer disease dementia mild cognitive impairment small vessel cerebrovascular disease subjective cognitive decline autoimmune encephalitis apathy motivation index ami analogous caregiver version ami cg find caregiver report apathy consistently exceed self report level condition self report apathy account 14.1 variance caregiver rating apathy reporting discrepancy pronounce condition associate impaired insight behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia significantly correlate cognitive impairment deficit memory fluency explain additional 11.2 variance caregiver report apathy specifically executive function deficit e.g. index fluency memory impairment contribute behavioural inertia recall finding highlight need integrate patient caregiver perspective apathy assessment especially condition prominent cognitive impairment improve diagnostic accuracy deepen understanding apathy neurological disorder highlight need adapt apathy assessment strategy account cognitive impairment particularly individual insight memory deficit understand cognitive mechanism underpin discordant apathy reporting dementia help inform targeted clinical intervention reduce caregiver burden
40568414,Tailoring Treatment for Substance Use Disorders in Older Adults: A Mixed-methods Study.,"The number of persons in mid-to-late life with substance use disorders (SUDs) in the United States has tripled over the past 2 decades, with opioid use disorder largely accounting for this increase. Older individuals with SUDs have unique medical, psychological, and social needs. Despite these needs and growing demand for SUD treatment within this age group, little is known regarding availability of specialized SUD treatment programs for older persons and barriers or facilitators to implementing these services. We conducted a mixed-methods study, first conducting qualitative interviews with counselors at outpatient SUD treatment facilities in Connecticut (<i>N</i> = 10). We then used these qualitative interview findings to guide analysis of quantitative data from SAMHSA's National Substance Use and Mental Health Services Survey (N-SUMHSS) and the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) survey. Using the Behavioral Model of Health Services Utilization for Vulnerable Populations and Framework Analysis, we identified predisposing (eg, treatment attitudes), enabling (eg, transportation), need-based (eg, comorbidities; integrated care), and healthcare system-related (eg, insurance) characteristics affecting older adults' SUD treatment engagement. SUD treatment facilities offering ""a tailored program for seniors or older adults"" increased steadily in Connecticut, and the United States overall, between 2010 and 2022. Of the 74 (43%) Connecticut facilities offering tailored older adult services, social, structural, and mental health services were offered at high rates (64%-86%), but medical services were offered at lower rates (39%-52%). Our findings indicate a gap between the treatment needs of older adults with SUDs and available services. Greater attention to integrated medical services, screening for geriatric-specific syndromes that could impede treatment access (eg, cognitive impairment; mobility), and appropriate workforce training is needed to optimize treatment for older adults with SUD, especially considering the opioid use disorder epidemic in the United States.",Innovation in aging,2025.0,Megan O'Grady; Kristyn Zajac; Alexandra DePalma; Yang Liu; Lisa C Barry,number person mid late life substance use disorder sud united states triple past 2 decade opioid use disorder largely account increase old individual sud unique medical psychological social need despite need grow demand sud treatment age group little know availability specialized sud treatment program old person barrier facilitator implement service conduct mixed method study conduct qualitative interview counselor outpatient sud treatment facility connecticut < > n</i > = 10 qualitative interview finding guide analysis quantitative datum samhsa national substance use mental health services survey n sumhss national survey substance abuse treatment services n ssats survey behavioral model health services utilization vulnerable populations framework analysis identify predispose eg treatment attitude enable eg transportation need base eg comorbiditie integrate care healthcare system relate eg insurance characteristic affect old adult sud treatment engagement sud treatment facility offer tailor program senior old adult increase steadily connecticut united states overall 2010 2022 74 43 connecticut facility offering tailor old adult service social structural mental health service offer high rate 64%-86 medical service offer low rate 39%-52 finding indicate gap treatment need old adult sud available service great attention integrate medical service screen geriatric specific syndrome impede treatment access eg cognitive impairment mobility appropriate workforce training need optimize treatment old adult sud especially consider opioid use disorder epidemic united states
40568361,Quantitative 3D reconstruction of viral vector distribution in rodent and ovine brain following local delivery.,"Viral vectors are an active area of research and development to treat diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). However, systemic delivery of large-molecular weight biologics is complicated by limited crossing of the blood-brain barrier, immunological clearance from the circulation, off-target effects, and systemic or organ toxicity. Local drug delivery can mitigate these obstacles, however, the drug must still be distributed over sufficiently large tissue volume to achieve the desired efficacy. In the field of drug delivery, quantitative, high resolution spatial analysis of drug distribution in the brain and other organs poses a challenge. To address this issue, we introduce a computational pipeline to reconstruct and quantify 3D distribution of locally delivered viral vectors from 2D microscopy images of subsampled brain sections. This pipeline, which combined existing and newly developed machine-learning and other computational tools, effectively removed false positive artifacts abundant in large-scale images of uncleared tissue sections, and subsampling adequately predicted the dispersion of model viral vectors from the point of local drug delivery. Furthermore, the pipeline successfully captured differences in the distribution of adeno virus (AdV) and adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors exhibiting varying sizes and transport properties. Notably, the proposed method is directly applicable to the distribution studies of therapeutics in large animal models. Thus, our developed pipeline is an accessible tool that can aid the research and development of local drug delivery strategies for the treatment of CNS diseases with viral vectors and potentially other therapeutics.",Neuroimage.

40568349,"Unraveling the Gut-Liver-Brain Axis: Microbiome, Inflammation, and Emerging Therapeutic Approaches.","The gut-liver-brain axis (GLB axis) plays a crucial role in maintaining metabolic, immune, and neurological homeostasis. The gut microbiota influences systemic health through its metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids (BAs), and tryptophan (Trp) derivatives, which regulate immune function, lipid metabolism, and neurotransmitter balance. Dysbiosis is an imbalance in gut microbiota that has been implicated in metabolic dysfuntion associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), alcohol-associated liver disease (AALD), and neuroinflammatory conditions such as schizophrenia. Increased gut permeability allows microbial byproducts like lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) to enter the liver and brain, activating inflammatory pathways that contribute to disease progression. Moreover, hepatic dysfunction can lead to neuroinflammation and cognitive impairments. Understanding the interplay between microbial metabolites and host physiology provides insight into novel therapeutic interventions. Strategies such as probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, fecal microbiota transfer (FMT), and postbiotics offer potential treatments to restore gut eubiosis and mitigate disease severity. This review highlights the mechanistic role of the GLB axis in health and disease, emphasizing microbiome-targeted therapies as a promising avenue for managing metabolic and neuropsychiatric disorders. <b>Trial Registration:</b> ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04823676, NCT02496390, NCT06024681, NCT02721264.",Mediators of inflammation,2025.0,Hiral Aghara; Manali Patel; Prashsti Chadha; Kirti Parwani; Ruchi Chaturvedi; Palash Mandal,gut liver brain axis glb axis play crucial role maintain metabolic immune neurological homeostasis gut microbiota influence systemic health metabolite include short chain fatty acid scfas bile acid bas tryptophan trp derivative regulate immune function lipid metabolism neurotransmitter balance dysbiosis imbalance gut microbiota implicate metabolic dysfuntion associate fatty liver disease mafld alcohol associate liver disease aald neuroinflammatory condition schizophrenia increase gut permeability allow microbial byproduct like lipopolysaccharide lpss enter liver brain activate inflammatory pathway contribute disease progression hepatic dysfunction lead neuroinflammation cognitive impairment understand interplay microbial metabolite host physiology provide insight novel therapeutic intervention strategy probiotic prebiotic synbiotic fecal microbiota transfer fmt postbiotic offer potential treatment restore gut eubiosis mitigate disease severity review highlight mechanistic role glb axis health disease emphasize microbiome target therapy promising avenue manage metabolic neuropsychiatric disorder < b > trial registration:</b > clinicaltrials.gov identifi nct04823676 nct02496390 nct06024681 nct02721264

40568294,Managing Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) in the Digital Era: Overcoming Barriers to Lifestyle Change.,"Obesity presents a significant global health challenge due to its association with a range of systemic disorders. One such condition is metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which has become the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. The prevalence of MASLD is closely linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and sedentary lifestyles, posing substantial risks for liver-related morbidity and extrahepatic complications such as cardiovascular and renal diseases. Despite recent advancements in pharmacological treatments, lifestyle modification remains the cornerstone of MASLD management. This review summarizes current evidence on lifestyle interventions, focusing on weight loss, dietary improvements, and increased physical activity. It also explores barriers to implementation, including socioeconomic factors, limited patient awareness, and stigma, while highlighting innovative strategies such as group-based programs, web-based interventions, and mobile technologies.

While EMH is typically asymptomatic, it can manifest as paraspinal masses that cause spinal cord compression, resulting in severe neurological deficits. This case highlights the complexities in managing overlapping hematologic conditions and emphasizes the importance of timely diagnosis and intervention. We present a 50-year-old male with a longstanding history of TI and CML, who developed progressive lower extremity weakness, gait instability, and sensory deficits due to spinal cord compression from EMH. This case underscores the critical need for clinical awareness and early intervention in patients with hematologic disorders who present with neurological symptoms.

40568231,Clinical characteristics of tic disorders in children and adolescents with the chief complaint of abnormal blinking.,"Abnormal blinking is a common symptom shared by allergic conjunctivitis (AC), dry eye disease (DED), and tic disorders (TD). This study explored clinical manifestations of TD in patients with the chief complaint of abnormal blinking; its goal was to reduce misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis. In total, 1054 patients with the chief complaint of abnormal blinking completed a questionnaire and underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examinations and mental health assessments. Questionnaire data were compiled for patients with a confirmed diagnosis of TD; their clinical characteristics were analyzed. Of the 1054 patients presenting with abnormal blinking, 453 (42.98%) were diagnosed with a TD. Among these 453 patients, 253 (55.63%) had provisional tic disorder (PTD). 121 (26.71%) patients initially were misdiagnosed (primarily with AC) or experienced a missed diagnosis; Patients with PTD were more likely to seek ophthalmologic care, whereas those with CTD or TS were more likely to visit a paediatrician (P<0.001). The predominant eye tics were excessive and/or frequent blinking; 438 (96.69%) patients exhibited tics other than eye tics. Among the TD patients, 371 (81.90%) reported ocular symptoms, whereas 336 (74.17%) had comorbid eye diseases including AC and DED. PTD patients with AC had higher incidences of allergic rhinitis and asthma compared with patients displaying CTD and TS (P<0.05).

40568088,Large-scale HLA immunopeptidome and interactome profiling in microglia.,"Microglia are immune cells of the brain and act as major antigen presenting cells. Antigen presentation involves the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex, which is implicated in genetic risk of multiple neurodegenerative diseases. How HLA affects the function of microglia in the context of neurodegenerative disease remains unclear. Here, we investigated the HLA epitopes and their protein interactome in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia-like cells (iMGLs) using systematic mass spectrometry (MS)-based immunopeptidomics, whole-cell proteomics, affinity purification, and prediction algorithms. Our results revealed the presence of almost 7,000 peptides presented by HLA class I and II within microglia. We further showed that the immunopeptidome landscapes of iPSCs, iMGLs and interferon-gamma (IFNγ) stimulated iMGLs are all readily distinguishable. Furthermore, HLA interacts with different groups of proteins in iPSCs compared to iMGLs which involve proteins in immune response. Importantly, we detected 25 HLA epitopes derived from 15 genes associated with Alzheimer's and related dementias such as Tau, PLD3 (Alzheimer's disease), TDP-43, FUS (Frontotemporal dementia), and PARK7, VPS35 (Lewy Body dementia). We predicted 31 mutant epitopes derived from these ADRD genes that could be presented with strong interaction to HLA molecules. Along with these epitopes, we observed an enrichment of immune-related interaction proteins in microglia treated with IFNγ. These results provide evidence that aggregated and mutated proteins can interact with HLA alleles and be presented on the cell surface by microglia cells.

To summarize current knowledge of long-term outcomes following TBEV infection, we systematically reviewed the prevalence of TBEV infection sequelae after hospital discharge across different age groups and follow-up time points. Studies of adults, children, and ""all-age"" populations with laboratory-confirmed TBEV infection were identified via electronic database searches. Study categorization was based on follow-up time after hospital discharge: ≤6, 7 to ≤12, or >12 months. Sequelae signs/symptoms were divided into 3 categories: neurological, neuropsychiatric, and other. Data were normalized using weighted means. Heterogeneity was estimated using a meta-analytic random-effects model. Fifteen studies were eligible for analysis (13 included only hospitalized patients). Seventy-nine unique sequelae symptoms were identified. Adults had a higher frequency of persistent symptoms than children (20.6%-100% vs 1.7%-69%). There were high levels of data heterogeneity (<i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> > 90%) among all studies. Although the proportion of patients with each sequela fluctuated across time, headache was reported by ≥20% of patients at all time points. Some sequelae also varied by age group; for example, irritability was more frequent in children, while insomnia/sleep disorders were more frequent in adults. Predominant neurological symptoms included balance disorders and headache. Predominant neuropsychiatric symptoms included concentration and memory disorders. Patients experience a variety of neurological, neuropsychiatric, or other sequelae symptoms following TBEV infection that vary over time and across age groups.

40567997,"Mental Health, Substance Use, and Tuberculosis Preventive Therapy in People With HIV: A Prospective Cohort Study.","Because of the association of mental health and substance use disorders with higher HIV mortality and decreased retention in care, we investigated their frequency and impact on tuberculosis preventive therapy (TPT) adherence and completion among people with HIV (PWHIV) initiating TPT. We conducted a prospective, longitudinal cohort study with a nested mixed methods study in 2 Johannesburg, South Africa, facilities. Participants were PWHIV on antiretroviral therapy initiating TPT between August and December 2023. We measured TPT adherence and completion with electronic medication boxes. We used validated tools to measure symptoms of anxiety, depression, alcohol use, and other substance use at enrollment and 12 weeks. We constructed multivariable regression models to determine associations of these variables with TPT adherence and completion, adjusting for age, sex, and time on antiretroviral therapy. We interviewed participants about mental health and experiences with TPT and analyzed responses using deductive content analysis. Among 224 PWHIV, 111 (50%) completed TPT. Eighty-one (36%) screened positive for depression symptoms and 63 (28%) for anxiety symptoms. Seventy-six (34%) reported unhealthy alcohol use and 60 (27%) tobacco use. Using multivariable models adjusting for confounders, only depression symptoms were significantly and negatively associated with adherence (9% fewer doses; 95% confidence interval, .4-16; <i>P</i> = .032) and completion (odds ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, .26-.90; <i>P</i> = .021).

40567980,The association between perceived COVID-19-related discrimination and probable depression among pregnant women in the post-pandemic era: a cross-sectional study.,"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has substantially influenced the physical and psychological wellbeing of populations who survived the pandemic. Discrimination against infected individuals has been a public health concern and has been identified as a risk factor for mental health issues. However, limited empirical evidence is available to support its role in psychological disorders during the prenatal period. The current study aims to investigate the association between COVID-19-related discrimination and the likelihood of experiencing probable depression among women in their early pregnancy. A cross-sectional study was conducted from 1 May 2023 to 31 August 2023 using an anonymous online questionnaire distributed to women in their first trimester of pregnancy in the antenatal care clinic of three hospitals. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to screen antenatal depression. The logistic regression model was used to assess the relationship between COVID-19-related discrimination and antenatal depression. A total of 3,608 pregnant women were enrolled in this study, of whom 657 screened positive for antenatal depression (AND), resulting in a prevalence of 18.2%. More than one-third of the participants experienced COVID-19-related discrimination. The logistic regression analysis demonstrated a greater prevalence of probable depression among pregnant women who experienced COVID-19-related discrimination compared with those who did not. This study provided novel evidence for the association between COVID-19-related discrimination and probable depression in pregnant women, highlighting an associated factor for supportive interventions that may be relevant in the post-pandemic era.",Frontiers in public health,2025.0,Peiqin Liang; Yu Chen; Runjun Li; Yan Liu; Ribo Xiong,"2019 coronavirus disease covid-19 substantially influence physical psychological wellbeing population survive pandemic discrimination infected individual public health concern identify risk factor mental health issue limited empirical evidence available support role psychological disorder prenatal period current study aim investigate association covid-19 relate discrimination likelihood experience probable depression woman early pregnancy cross sectional study conduct 1 2023 31 august 2023 anonymous online questionnaire distribute woman trimester pregnancy antenatal care clinic hospital edinburgh postnatal depression scale screen antenatal depression logistic regression model assess relationship covid-19 relate discrimination antenatal depression total 3,608 pregnant woman enrol study 657 screen positive antenatal depression result prevalence 18.2 participant experience covid-19 relate discrimination logistic regression analysis demonstrate great prevalence probable depression pregnant woman experience covid-19 relate discrimination compare study provide novel evidence association covid-19 relate discrimination probable depression pregnant woman highlight associate factor supportive intervention relevant post pandemic era"

Data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 database were analyzed to look at the global, national, and regional burden of depressive disorders among individuals aged 15-39 from 1990 to 2021. Incidence rates, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and contributions of various risk factors to DALYs were also examined in this research. All incidence and disability-adjusted life year (DALY) rates were calculated per 100,000 population and are presented with corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). The burden of disease through 2050 was projected using Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) modeling. Globally, the incidence in 2021 was estimated at 158,696,139.89 cases (95% UI, 129,182,271.23-197,238,491.78), with associated DALYs totaling 25,093,054.94 (95% UI, 16,739,757.06-35,139,293.90). Between 1990 and 2021, the incidence rose by 62.91% (95% UI, 57.91-68.12%), while DALYs increased by 60.46% (95% UI, 55.99-64.91%). The highest estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) for both incidence [2.63%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.45-2.82%] and DALYs (2.72%; 95% CI, 2.57-2.88%) were identified in low Socio-demographic Index (SDI) regions. Western Europe had the most cases (9,939,816.39; 95% UI, 8,081,380.82-12,409,843.00) among the 21 geographic regions examined in 2021. Globally, India exhibited the most significant burden in 2021, with incident cases reaching 32,241,303.32 (95% UI, 26,251,449.50-39,943,511.76). Furthermore, the largest burden of DALYs was observed in India, amounting to 5,034,818.12 (95% UI, 3,363,390.70-7,076,632.70). The global burden was primarily attributed to several significant risk factors, including exposure to behavioral risks, experiences of bullying victimization, incidents of childhood sexual abuse, experiences of childhood sexual abuse and bullying, as well as intimate partner violence. Projections extending to 2050 indicate an ongoing upward trend in the incidence rate within this demographic group during this period. Overall, the burden of depressive disorders in this population has shown a marked increase, especially in low-SDI regions.

40567964,Associations between local rates of violence and experiences of psychosis in Trinidad.,"Individual-level exposure to violence is known to influence various aspects of the experience of psychosis. This study aimed to assess the impact of local violence rates on the symptom profiles and outcomes of people with psychosis, their exposure to trauma and other potential risk and protective factors, and interactions with the police and mental health services, in a Caribbean country with high rates of violent crime. Data from 212 people with psychosis and matched population control participants were collected through a population-based programme of research on psychosis in Trinidad (INTREPID II) and linked geographically with crime statistics, disaggregated to the areas surrounding each police station. There was no evidence of a substantive association between local rates of violent crime and symptoms of psychosis or the course of illness on most measures, although people in lower crime areas appeared to be more likely to experience hallucinations than those living in high-violence areas (β-0.30, 95% CI -0.50--0.11, <i>p</i> < 0.01). There was some evidence that people living in high-violence areas were more likely to be restrained within the mental health system than those from lower-violence areas (OR 2.00, 95% CI 0.98-4.09, <i>p</i> = 0.06), despite being no more likely to act in violent or disruptive ways. The lack of association between violent crime and various aspects of psychosis may indicate that the psychological effect of violent crime is not confined to single localities, and may be influenced by other factors besides rates of violence in participants' immediate local area.

40567890,Functional connectivity of subsystems of the default-mode network in patients with early psychotic symptoms.,"Resting-state connectivity of the default-mode network (DMN) is aberrant in patients with chronic psychotic disorders as well in individuals with early stage psychosis. Studies of the DMN in healthy volunteers revealed that the DMN comprises several subnetworks. However, it is not yet clear if connectivity between and within these DMN subnetworks is aberrant in patients with early psychotic symptoms nor whether these connectivity patterns are related to symptomatology. This initial investigation examined functional connectivity between and within the DMN subnetworks in patients with early psychotic symptoms and in healthy volunteers, and probed how these connectivity patterns were related to the severity of clinical symptomatology. Functional connectivity was measured during resting-state in 30 patients with early psychotic symptoms and in 39 controls using functional MRI. We did not observe differences in connectivity within and between the subnetworks of the DMN between the control group and the early psychosis group. However, lower functional connectivity between the medial prefrontal and posterior medial subnetworks and between medial prefrontal and anterior temporal subnetworks of the DMN did predict the severity of the negative symptoms. The findings of this initial investigation provide insight into the associations between functional connectivity of DMN subnetworks and symptomatology in patients with early psychotic symptoms.",Neuroimage.

40567880,Beyond one-size-fits-all: managing mental health calls with the integrated Behavioral Emergency Assessment and Response (iBEAR) model.,"Several countries have committed to improving law enforcement response to behavioral emergencies through mental health crisis response and intervention training as well as by implementing crisis intervention team programs. However, these measures often rely primarily on traditional crisis intervention methods adapted from clinical settings. At the same time, not all behavioral emergencies constitute a mental health crisis and can be responded to with a single generic approach. Psychiatric disorders, intellectual and developmental disabilities, and/or adverse life circumstances can also result in behaviors that are below crisis threshold but still prompt emergency calls. Such presentations reflect maladaptive coping mechanisms rather than a complete loss of coping capacity seen during acute crisis and include, for instance, drug-seeking criminal behaviors in individuals with substance use disorders or self-stimulatory behaviors in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, particularly when such behaviors violate social norms. Crisis intervention alone fails to fully address the complex nature of these incidents. Currently, no existing framework effectively integrates guidelines for first responders to manage both acute crises and maladaptive behaviors that do not stem from a crisis state. To fill this gap, we propose the integrated Behavioral Emergency Assessment and Response (iBEAR) model as a theory-driven framework that equips first responders with evidence-based assessment, decision-making, and response strategies, easy to access while managing potentially dynamic and stressful behavioral emergencies. The model responds to well-documented demand for enhanced training and preparedness in managing behavioral emergencies, while also addressing the increasing burden of such incidents on emergency services.",Frontiers in psychology,2025.0,Benni Zaiser; Mario S Staller; Swen Koerner,country commit improve law enforcement response behavioral emergency mental health crisis response intervention training implement crisis intervention team program measure rely primarily traditional crisis intervention method adapt clinical setting time behavioral emergency constitute mental health crisis respond single generic approach psychiatric disorder intellectual developmental disability and/or adverse life circumstance result behavior crisis threshold prompt emergency call presentation reflect maladaptive cope mechanism complete loss cope capacity see acute crisis include instance drug seek criminal behavior individual substance use disorder self stimulatory behavior individual autism spectrum disorder particularly behavior violate social norm crisis intervention fail fully address complex nature incident currently exist framework effectively integrate guideline responder manage acute crisis maladaptive behavior stem crisis state fill gap propose integrated behavioral emergency assessment response ibear model theory drive framework equip responder evidence base assessment decision making response strategy easy access manage potentially dynamic stressful behavioral emergency model respond document demand enhanced training preparedness manage behavioral emergency address increase burden incident emergency service
40567830,Depressive and Insomnia Symptoms Among Older Adults With Different Chronic Pain Trajectories: A Network Analysis Based on Observation Over an Eight-Year Period.,"<b>Background:</b> Depressive and insomnia symptoms are common among older adults with chronic pain. We aimed to examine different chronic pain trajectories of older adults over an 8-year observation period and explore the network structures of depression and insomnia in each chronic pain group. <b>Methods:</b> The trajectories of pain in the USA-based Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data from 2010 to 2018 were examined using latent class growth analyses (LCGA) method. Depressive and insomnia symptoms were measured with the eight-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CESD-8) Scale and the four-item Jenkins Sleep Scale (JSS-4), respectively. Network models were constructed using the Ising model. Central symptoms and bridge symptoms were identified via expectedInfluence (EI) and bridge EI, respectively. <b>Results:</b> A total of 11,132 older adults were included in the trajectory analysis, with three chronic pain trajectories identified, including ""severe pain trajectory,"" ""moderate pain trajectory,"" and ""non or mild pain trajectory"". From these trajectories, ""Lack of happiness"" (CESD4), ""Feeling depressed"" (CESD1), and ""Feeling sad"" (CESD7) emerged as the most central symptoms, while ""Feeling tired in the morning"" (JSS4) was identified as the key bridge symptom. However, the findings may not be generalizable to other parts of the world outside the USA. <b>Conclusion:</b> Older adults with different chronic pain trajectories exhibited similar depression and insomnia network structure.

40567829,How Do Patients' Fear Prediction and Fear Experience Impact Exposure-Based Therapy for Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia? A Comprehensive Analysis of Fear Prediction.,"Expectancy violation has been proposed as a potential core mechanism of action in psychotherapy, particularly in exposure therapy for anxiety disorders. However, various relevant expectations have been discussed, and empirical studies examining their significance are still scarce. This study aimed to investigate one specific form of expectancy violation, based on Rachman's (1994) match-mismatch model, specifically by comparing expected and experienced fear and examining their relationship to safety behaviour during exposure in vivo in 268 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for panic disorder with agoraphobia. Participants underwent exposure to a highly controlled manual-based cognitive behaviour therapy in a randomised multicenter psychotherapy study. Participants tended to overpredict fear during exposure. Both expected and experienced fear significantly decreased over the course of repeated exposure exercises, while prediction (in)accuracy (difference between expected and experienced fear) remained stable. The decrease in expected fear over time was a strong predictor of treatment outcomes for the Bodily Sensations Questionnaire (BSQ) and Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS) at post. Even more, the reduction in expected fear was a significant predictor of treatment success across all outcome measures in the follow-up assessment. These findings suggest that violating excessive fear expectancies is not a necessary condition for symptom reduction during exposure therapy.",Depression and anxiety,2025.0,Marina Hilleke; Thomas Lang; Sylvia Helbig-Lang; Georg W Alpers; Volker Arolt; Jürgen Deckert; Thomas Fydrich; Alfons O Hamm; Tilo Kircher; Jan Richter; Andreas Ströhle; Hans-Ulrich Wittchen; Alexander L Gerlach,expectancy violation propose potential core mechanism action psychotherapy particularly exposure therapy anxiety disorder relevant expectation discuss empirical study examine significance scarce study aim investigate specific form expectancy violation base rachman 1994 match mismatch model specifically compare expect experience fear examine relationship safety behaviour exposure vivo 268 patient meet dsm iv criterion panic disorder agoraphobia participant undergo exposure highly control manual base cognitive behaviour therapy randomised multicenter psychotherapy study participant tend overpredict fear exposure expect experience fear significantly decrease course repeat exposure exercise prediction in)accuracy difference expect experience fear remain stable decrease expected fear time strong predictor treatment outcome bodily sensations questionnaire bsq panic agoraphobia scale pas post reduction expect fear significant predictor treatment success outcome measure follow assessment finding suggest violate excessive fear expectancy necessary condition symptom reduction exposure therapy

Numerous clinical methods have been proposed in research to diagnose these disorders; however, a current trend in diagnosis is through human gait patterns. Several researchers proposed different methods in this area, including gait detection utilizing sensor-based data and vision-based systems that include both marker-based and marker-free techniques. The majority of current studies are concerned with the classification of Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, many vision-based algorithms rely on human gait silhouettes or gait representations and employ traditional similarity-based methodologies. However, in this study, a novel approach is proposed in which spatiotemporal features are extracted <i>via</i> deep learning methods with a transfer learning paradigm. Following that, advanced deep learning approaches, including sequential models like gated recurrent unit (GRU), are used for additional analysis.

40567554,Exploring Nicotine Dependence Among People Using Methamphetamine During Methadone Maintenance Treatment in Vietnam.,"Cigarette smoking is common among individuals with substance use disorders and those undergoing addiction treatment. Cigarette use is highly comorbid with methamphetamine use, and among individuals who co-use methamphetamine and opioids, nicotine dependence may further complicate smoking cessation efforts. This study examines nicotine dependence levels and associated factors among people who use methamphetamine undergoing methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) in Vietnam. This cross-sectional analysis utilized baseline data from 667 participants enrolled in a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of various combinations of behavioral evidence-based interventions for methamphetamine use among patients on MMT in Vietnam (STAR-OM R01DA050486). Data on levels of nicotine dependence and other covariates including demographic, health status, treatment characteristics and substance use were collected. Nicotine dependence was measured using the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence, with a score of 6 or higher indicating high dependence. Logistic regression estimated the association between nicotine dependence and various psychosocial and behavioral factors. Overall, 96.7% of the participants were current smokers with 247 of them (38.3%) exhibiting high nicotine dependence. Greater severity of methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms (OR: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01-1.05) and a high risk of depression, anxiety or stress (OR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.14-2.72) were associated with increased odds of high nicotine dependence. Conversely, older age at onset of methamphetamine use was associated with lower odds of high nicotine dependence. Cigarette smoking was highly prevalent among individuals using methamphetamine during MMT, with many exhibiting high nicotine dependence.

40567506,Brain functional connectivity associated with cognitive deficits in younger patients at first episode of schizophrenia.,"Cognitive deficits are a core feature of schizophrenia and are influenced by the age at onset of psychosis. Both preclinical and early-onset schizophrenia patients exhibit abnormalities in the frontal cortex, parahippocampus, precuneus, and hippocampus-regions that are closely associated with cognitive deficits. This study examines whether cognitive-related functional connectivity (FC) within these regions differs in first-episode schizophrenia (FES) patients with varying ages of onset. FES patients (ages 18-45, <i>n</i> = 24) and matched healthy controls (HC, <i>n</i> = 29) were divided into younger and older subgroups based on the median age of 25 years: FES_young, FES_older, HC_young, and HC_older. All participants completed the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) and underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. FC within regions of interest (ROIs) was analyzed using the CONN toolbox. Significant cognitive differences were observed between the four groups (H = 13.447, <i>p</i> = 0.004, Rank ε<sup>2</sup> = 0.259). The most prominent differences were found between the FES_young and HC_young groups (Holm-adjusted <i>p</i> = 0.012). Cognitive deficits in FES patients were significantly associated with reduced FC between the right precuneus (A31_R) and right parahippocampal gyrus (TI_R) (rho = 0.549, <i>p</i> = 0.010, Fisher's z = 0.616). FES_young showed significantly lower FC between A31_R and TI_R compared to HC_young (Holm-adjusted <i>p</i> = 0.001).

40567464,"Post-traumatic Stress Disorders among Survivors of Road Traffic Crash injuries aged 18 Years and above, in Kigali City, Rwanda.","Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) affects approximately 4% of the world's population and is one of the most prevalent mental illnesses among survivors of road traffic crashes; however, it has received little attention in the clinical setting. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and factors associated with PTSD among survivors of road traffic crash injuries aged not less than 18 years obtaining follow-up care in public hospitals in Kigali, Rwanda. This cross-sectional study included 288 survivors of road traffic crash injuries who were obtaining care in three public hospitals in Kigali for two months, from 1st August to 30th September 2023. The PTSD was diagnosed using a clinician-administered PTSD scale described in DSM V. Binary logistic regression was used to identify the factors linked to PTSD. The previous history of traumatic events was assessed using a Life Event Checklist for Diagnostic Statistical Manual-V (DSM-V). Of the 288 survivors, 50 (17.36%), were diagnosed to experience PTSD.

40567365,The supporting role of Schwann cells in perineural invasion of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive cancer, with tumor cells readily disseminating to other organs through the bloodstream, lymphatic system, and nervous system, thereby impacting patients' survival rates. PDAC is often associated with perineural invasion (PNI), which not only facilitates tumor spread but may also lead to symptoms such as pain, further affecting the patient's quality of life. PNI is frequently observed in PDAC and has become an important histopathological marker associated with poor clinical outcomes. Many studies suggest that a high density of Schwann cells (SCs) is typically found in areas of PNI in PDAC. What's more, as the primary glial cells in the PNS, SCs actively contribute to pancreatic tumour progression by releasing substances capable of interacting with cancer cells and promoting cancer cells proliferation and migration in tumor microenvironment (TME). Therefore, SCs are crucial in the interactions between nerves and tumors as the primary glial cells within PNS. In this review, our objective is to present novel insights and perspectives for PDAC therapy that targets SCs and related signal pathways to decrease PNI, thereby reduce pain and prolong survival in cancer patients. We detail and summarize the multiple mechanisms by which SCs promote PNI in tumors and thus lead to malignancy.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2025.0,Yun He; Zheng Chen; Liu Yang; Shuanying Qiao; Zonghua Su; Feng Ding; Fadian Ding; Fuli Xin; Siyu Xiang; Aiping Lyu; Fangfei Li,pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma pdac highly aggressive cancer tumor cell readily disseminate organ bloodstream lymphatic system nervous system impact patient survival rate pdac associate perineural invasion pni facilitate tumor spread lead symptom pain affect patient quality life pni frequently observe pdac important histopathological marker associate poor clinical outcome study suggest high density schwann cell sc typically find area pni pdac primary glial cell pns sc actively contribute pancreatic tumour progression release substance capable interact cancer cell promote cancer cell proliferation migration tumor microenvironment tme sc crucial interaction nerve tumor primary glial cell pns review objective present novel insight perspective pdac therapy target sc relate signal pathway decrease pni reduce pain prolong survival cancer patient detail summarize multiple mechanism sc promote pni tumor lead malignancy
40567268,Psychiatric Disorders Mediate the Association between Floods and Dementia: A Prospective Cohort Study in the UK Biobank.,"Flooding has become more frequent and severe worldwide, leading to an increased burden of psychiatric disorders (e.g., depression and anxiety). Psychiatric disorders are associated with an increased risk of subsequent dementia. However, the associations among floods, psychiatric disorders, and dementia are still unclear. Using a population cohort from the UK Biobank, we aimed to investigate the mediating role of psychiatric disorders on the associations between floods and dementia. In this study, cumulative exposure to floods over an eight-year period preceding the study baseline was assessed for each participant at residential addresses. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to study the associations of flooding exposure with psychiatric disorders and dementia. Stratified analyses and mediation analyses were conducted to examine whether psychiatric disorders mediate the relationship between floods and dementia. During a median follow-up of 12.3 years (interquartile range: 11.6-13.0), 0.9% (2,028) of participants developed dementia and 9.5% (21,629) were diagnosed with psychiatric disorders. The flooding exposure was associated with an 8.0% increased risk of incident dementia (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 1.080, 95% CI: 1.023-1.141). The flood-dementia association was observed to be partially mediated by several subtypes of psychiatric disorders (overall proportion of mediation: 75.7%), with psychotic disorder accounting for 49.7% (indirect effect HR: 1.039, 95% confidence interval: 1.015-1.064) of flood-related dementia, followed by stress-related disorder (proportion of mediation: 18.1%), and depression (proportion of mediation: 3.9%). This study provides evidence of an increased risk of dementia associated with exposure to floods, with psychiatric disorders playing a crucial mediating role in the flood-related dementia pathway. These findings suggest that flooding exposure is a critical risk factor for dementia, and targeted interventions addressing postdisaster mental health may be crucial for dementia prevention in affected populations.","Environment & health (Washington, D.C.)",2025.0,Yao Wu; Bo Wen; Danijela Gasevic; Rongbin Xu; Zhengyu Yang; Pei Yu; Yanming Liu; Guowei Zhou; Yan Zhang; Jiangning Song; Hong Liu; Shanshan Li; Yuming Guo,"flooding frequent severe worldwide lead increase burden psychiatric disorder e.g. depression anxiety psychiatric disorder associate increase risk subsequent dementia association flood psychiatric disorder dementia unclear population cohort uk biobank aim investigate mediate role psychiatric disorder association flood dementia study cumulative exposure flood year period precede study baseline assess participant residential address multivariable cox proportional hazard regression study association flood exposure psychiatric disorder dementia stratified analysis mediation analysis conduct examine psychiatric disorder mediate relationship flood dementia median follow 12.3 year interquartile range 11.6 13.0 0.9 2,028 participant develop dementia 9.5 21,629 diagnose psychiatric disorder flooding exposure associate 8.0 increase risk incident dementia hazard ratio hr 1.080 95 ci 1.023 1.141 flood dementia association observe partially mediate subtype psychiatric disorder overall proportion mediation 75.7 psychotic disorder account 49.7 indirect effect hr 1.039 95 confidence interval 1.015 1.064 flood relate dementia follow stress relate disorder proportion mediation 18.1 depression proportion mediation 3.9 study provide evidence increase risk dementia associate exposure flood psychiatric disorder play crucial mediating role flood relate dementia pathway finding suggest flooding exposure critical risk factor dementia target intervention address postdisaster mental health crucial dementia prevention affected population"

The main pathophysiological mechanism of this syndrome is a widespread ischemia-reperfusion damage, then there are other pathological alterations involving various organs which, if untreated, can evolve into multiorgan dysfunction. For this reason, a series of diagnostic-therapeutic actions (bundles) are necessary to ensure a correct management of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome: adequate oxygenation and ventilation, hemodynamic stabilization, temperature control, early prediction of neurological outcome, optimization of metabolic aspects, indication and timing of coronary angiography. The management of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome, the fifth link in the chain of survival, consists of a set of early, complex and multidisciplinary interventions, which must be promptly started, immediately after a return of spontaneous circulation, regardless of the location of cardiac arrest presentation, and it aims to obtain a good hemodynamic and neurological recovery.

40567179,"Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs, Carbamazepine and Phenytoin, on Plasma Concentrations of Clozapine and Its N-Desmethyl and N-Oxide Metabolites in Japanese Patients With Schizophrenia.","Clozapine (CLZ) is used for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. However, in Japanese patients, its pharmacokinetics are still not well described, and there are no case reports about drug interactions between CLZ and concomitant antiepileptics that can affect cytochrome P450 (CYP) activity, because CLZ is mainly metabolized by CYP. In two Japanese cases, for therapeutic drug monitoring, the trough plasma concentrations of CLZ, N-desmethyl clozapine (NCLZ) and N-oxide clozapine (OCLZ) were measured, and the ratios of them and the daily dose (D) were used as indicators of drug metabolism. In a male patient in his 20s, the CLZ/D ratio ([ng/mL]/[mg/day]) was significantly decreased, and both NCLZ/CLZ and OCLZ/CLZ ratios were significantly increased with carbamazepine, relative to CLZ alone. In another male patient in his 30s, the CLZ/D ratio was lower with phenytoin than without phenytoin. The NCLZ/CLZ ratio was higher with phenytoin than without phenytoin. Despite these expectations, the OCLZ/CLZ ratio showed a slight decrease with phenytoin. These results in the two Japanese cases demonstrate the effects of antiepileptics on plasma concentrations, not only of CLZ but also of its major metabolites NCLZ and OCLZ. Metabolism-enhancing interactions with CLZ were demonstrated for carbamazepine, a CYP3A4- and CYP1A2-inducer. However, for phenytoin, which is also known as a CYP3A4-inducer, the drug interactions with CLZ were not very clear due to the small limited data.

40567162,From injury to recovery: Spatiotemporal dynamics of the visual pathway during spontaneous structural and functional regeneration after optic nerve transection in zebrafish.,"In adult mammals, optic nerve injury leads to irreversible vision loss due to its extremely limited regenerative capacity. In contrast, adult zebrafish possess a robust capacity for spontaneous visual system regeneration, although the spatiotemporal coordination of recovery across the retina, optic nerve, and brain remains poorly understood. In the present study, the regenerative dynamics following optic nerve transection were systematically characterized in adult zebrafish over a 5 week period using hematoxylin-eosin staining, immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy, single-cell RNA sequencing, and optokinetic response (OKR) behavioral assessments. At 1 week post-injury (1 wpi), retinal ganglion cell depletion was evident but showed significant recovery by 2 wpi. Concurrently, the injured optic nerve displayed a marked increase in diameter and cell number at 2 wpi, including widespread expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, consistent with heightened proliferative activity. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling at 2 wpi revealed five principal cell populations: fibroblasts, mural cells, immune cells, mature oligodendrocytes, and myelin-forming oligodendrocytes. By 4-5 wpi, remyelination within the optic nerve and re-establishment of synaptic architecture in the optic tectum were strongly correlated with functional restoration of OKR behavior. These findings provide a comprehensive spatiotemporal framework of visual pathway regeneration in zebrafish, establishing a valuable model for elucidating conserved mechanisms of neural repair with translational potential for human vision restoration.",Zoological research,2025.0,Bao-Guo Shen; Yuan Wen; Sheng-Jian Lu; Hong-Yuan Wei; Shu-Rui Huang; Guang-Ming Zhou; Wen-Tao Yan; Wen-Can Wu; Yi-Kui Zhang,adult mammal optic nerve injury lead irreversible vision loss extremely limited regenerative capacity contrast adult zebrafish possess robust capacity spontaneous visual system regeneration spatiotemporal coordination recovery retina optic nerve brain remains poorly understand present study regenerative dynamic follow optic nerve transection systematically characterize adult zebrafish 5 week period hematoxylin eosin staining immunohistochemistry transmission electron microscopy single cell rna sequencing optokinetic response okr behavioral assessment 1 week post injury 1 wpi retinal ganglion cell depletion evident show significant recovery 2 wpi concurrently injure optic nerve display marked increase diameter cell number 2 wpi include widespread expression proliferate cell nuclear antigen consistent heighten proliferative activity single cell transcriptomic profiling 2 wpi reveal principal cell population fibroblast mural cell immune cell mature oligodendrocyte myelin form oligodendrocyte 4 5 wpi remyelination optic nerve establishment synaptic architecture optic tectum strongly correlate functional restoration okr behavior finding provide comprehensive spatiotemporal framework visual pathway regeneration zebrafish establish valuable model elucidate conserve mechanism neural repair translational potential human vision restoration

This meta-analysis was conducted to address the above clinical question. Cognitive Function Scale's composite score (primary), seven domains of cognitive function (speed of processing, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning/problem solving, and social cognition) score, University of California San Diego Performance-Based Skills Assessment score, psychopathology scales score, discontinuation rate, and incidence of individual adverse events were among the study outcomes. The standardized mean differences (SMD) or risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Our meta-analysis included 11 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (n = 754). Our study evaluated ABT-288, betahistine, betahistine+reboxetine, GSK239512, MK-0249, and pitolisant. Betahistine has an H1-receptor agonistic reaction and H3-receptor antagonistic reaction, while other drugs only have an H3-receptor antagonistic/inverse agonistic reaction. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis for all outcomes divided by betahistine or other pooled H3R-ANTs/H3R-IAs. The study results show that betahistine outperformed placebo in the improvement of overall cognitive symptoms (SMD [95% CI] = -0.61 [-1.03, -0.18]), speed of processing (-0.44 [-0.87, -0.02]), attention/vigilance (-0.43 [-0.85, -0.01]), working memory (-0.48 [-0.90, -0.06]), verbal learning (-0.62 [-1.04, -0.19]), visual learning (-0.57 [-1.00, -0.15]), and betahistine+reboxetine was superior in the improvement of depressive symptoms (-4.04 [-5.10, -2.97]). Pitolisant outperformed placebo in depressive symptom improvement (-3.24 [-4.22, -2.26]). However, the results were derived from one betahistine, betahistine+reboxetine, or pitolisant study. Other pooled H3R-ANTs/H3R-IAs revealed risk of insomnia (RR [95% CI] = 2.18 [1.05, 4.55]). However, no differences were observed in other any outcomes between betahistine or other pooled H3R-ANTs/H3R-IAs and placebo.

The standard placement of the reservoir in the space of Retzius (SOR) may be contraindicated in patients with prior pelvic or abdominal surgery due to altered anatomy and increased risk of complications. This has led to the development of alternative ectopic reservoir placement techniques. In this narrative review, we summarize the literature on various ectopic reservoir approaches, including low and high submuscular placements, submuscular techniques with counter incisions or transfascial fixation, midline submuscular placement, subcutaneous placement, and lateral retroperitoneal approaches. We describe the surgical methods, outcomes, and complication rates associated with each technique. While most methods demonstrate low complication and revision rates, direct comparisons remain limited due to heterogeneity and lack of prospective data.

Secondary aims included assessing subgroup differences among healthcare professionals and exploring perceived barriers to utilizing these strategies in LTC.MethodsA cross-sectional online survey design was conducted with (allied) healthcare professionals working in LTC facilities across the Netherlands.ResultsOverall knowledge and utilization of compensation strategies among 130 healthcare professionals was high, with a median of 5 out of 7 known categories, 4 out of 7 used for gait, and 3 out of 5 for transfers. Variations among professions existed, with physiotherapists and occupational therapists demonstrating higher scores than nurses and personal care assistants. Professionals specifically trained in PD care and those working in specialized PD departments demonstrated a higher level of knowledge. Main identified barriers for utilization were limited knowledge and time of the healthcare professionals, and concerns regarding limited feasibility in patients with severe cognitive impairments.ConclusionsWhile knowledge and utilization of compensation strategies for PD in LTC facilities was widespread, the findings highlight a need for tailored training programs for healthcare professionals to improve patient care.

People prescribed opioid medications at least twice during the preceding six months (opioid group) and propensity score-matched patients, based on age, gender, comorbidity, and residential postcode-based socio-economic status (control group); matching was undertaken for each month of the study period. Mandatory prescription drug monitoring (from 1 April 2020); tighter restriction criteria for the subsidisation of opioid medications by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) (from 1 June 2020). Differences between the opioid and control groups in immediate changes after start of the intervention in rates of emergency department (ED) presentation and hospital admission related to opioid use, non-opioid substance use, self-harm, or mental health problems; differences between the two groups in the change in trend for these rates between the pre-intervention and intervention periods. Propensity matching was undertaken for 179 091 people in the opioid group and a total of 389 061 people in the control group. The opioid-related ED presentation rate for the opioid group had been increasing prior to the intervention, but declined after its introduction at a rate not significantly different from that of the control group. The immediate change in non-opioid substance-related ED presentation rate was greater for the opioid group than the control group (β, 11.1 [95% confidence interval, 1.7-20.5] presentations per 100 000 patients); by 31 March 2022, the rate had declined to below the pre-intervention level. Differences between groups in changes to self-harm- and mental health-related presentations, and in all hospital admission rates, were not statistically significant. Following implementation of two prescription opioid supply-restricting polices in 2020, the opioid-related ED presentation rate declined among people prescribed opioids; the non-opioid substance-related presentation rate initially increased, but was lower than the pre-intervention level by the end of the study period. Our findings suggest that some opioid-restricting policies can reduce opioid-related harm without increasing long term non-opioid substance- or mental health-related harm.

40567008,Depressive symptoms can negatively influence patient reported disease severity after subthalamic nucleus stimulation for Parkinson's disease.,"BackgroundDepression can negatively influence an individual's perception of their disease. Although subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is an effective treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD), some patients do not appreciate benefits despite showing objective improvements in motor function.ObjectiveWe explored the impact of depressive symptoms on self-reported outcomes of PD severity in patients who underwent STN-DBS.MethodsAssessments took place preoperatively and 2-years after surgery. Patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Parts 2 and 4, Gait and Falls Questionnaire, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39), and the Non-motor Symptoms Scale. The UPDRS Part 3 (motor examination) was also performed. Patients were dichotomized into two groups (normal or high) based on their postoperative follow-up HADS depression score.ResultsEighteen patients (33.3%) were assigned to the high group (hHADS-D), and 36 patients (66.7%) were assigned to the normal group (nHADS-D). The UPDRS Part 3 OFF-medication score improved to a similar extent in both groups, and participants experienced a similar reduction in their levodopa equivalent daily dose following STN-DBS. Unlike the nHADS-D group, however, hHADS-D patients did not self-report improvements on any clinical outcome measure at follow-up from baseline, and instead indicated a significant worsening on the UPDRS Part 2 ON-medication and PDQ-39 cognition domain. This was not explicable by their preoperative non-motor symptom burden, nor changes in dopaminergic medications. There were no differences between groups in terms of proportion using anti-depressants, surgical complications or postoperative side effects.ConclusionsDepressive symptoms may play a significant role in subjective self-reporting, and should be carefully considered when evaluating STN-DBS effectiveness and managing patients postoperatively.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2025.0,Christine Girges; Alexis de Roquemaurel; Nirosen Vijiaratnam; Jennifer Foley; Joseph Candelario; Maricel Salazar; Catherine Milabo; John Esperida; Tim Grover; Harith Akram; Jonathan Hyam; Marie T Krüger; Ludvic Zrinzo; Patricia Limousin; Thomas Foltynie,backgrounddepression negatively influence individual perception disease subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation stn dbs effective treatment parkinson disease pd patient appreciate benefit despite show objective improvement motor function objectivewe explore impact depressive symptom self report outcome pd severity patient undergo stn dbs.methodsassessments take place preoperatively 2 year surgery patient complete hospital anxiety depression scale hads unified parkinson disease rating scale updrs part 2 4 gait falls questionnaire parkinson disease questionnaire-39 pdq-39 non motor symptoms scale updrs 3 motor examination perform patient dichotomize group normal high base postoperative follow hads depression score resultseighteen patient 33.3 assign high group hhads d 36 patient 66.7 assign normal group nhads d updrs 3 medication score improve similar extent group participant experience similar reduction levodopa equivalent daily dose follow stn dbs unlike nhads d group hhads d patient self report improvement clinical outcome measure follow baseline instead indicate significant worsening updrs 2 medication pdq-39 cognition domain explicable preoperative non motor symptom burden change dopaminergic medication difference group term proportion anti depressant surgical complication postoperative effect conclusionsdepressive symptom play significant role subjective self reporting carefully consider evaluate stn dbs effectiveness manage patient postoperatively
40566997,The Impact of Splicing Dysregulation on Neuromuscular Disorders and Current Neuromuscular Genetic Therapies.,"Eukaryotic genes contain non-coding segments known as introns, which interrupt coding sequences. Consequently, eukaryotic transcription produces precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) that relies on precise splicing to remove highly diverse introns from the genome and to generate the mature mRNA essential for maintaining normal cellular activities. The extensive heterogeneity of neurons necessitates complex splicing regulation, particularly alternative splicing, to ensure the accuracy of gene expression in neurogenesis, signal transduction, and synaptic function and to maintain stability and adaptability in the nervous system. With the improvement of genetic testing technology, aberrant splicing has been identified as a contributing factor to the pathogenesis of neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), myotonic dystrophy (DM), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), myasthenia gravis (MG), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Studying the correlation between splicing defects and neuromuscular disorders is crucial for gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases and for developing effective therapies.

Few studies exist about the perceived longer-term impact of the pandemic on this group. Data were collected through a two-stage narrative interview process. Six family members told their story about what their relative's lives were like at the first COVID-19 'lockdown', what their lives were like now, and what they hoped their lives would be like in the future. A second interview filled any gaps in the narrative. Data were analysed thematically. Four themes were identified: Deeping exclusion and inequality; 'I still haven't recovered'- Exhausted by the pandemic; A traumatic time-Disrupted routines, activities, and relationships and 'The future is a scary place.'

40566993,GABA-Producing Levilactobacillus brevis LAB6 Mitigates Pentylenetetrazol-Induced Gut-Brain Dysregulation in SD Rats.,"Understanding the communication between the gut and brain has emerged as a new research avenue in neurological disorders like epilepsy, with increasing evidence pointing towards the influence of intestinal microbes on the central nervous system. Here, the protective effects of a psychobiotic strain Levilactobacillus brevis LAB6 MTCC 25662 supplementation against pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindling in male Sprague Dawley rats was studied. Two GABA-producing strains Levilactobacillus brevis LAB6 and Limosilactobacillus fermentum LAB19 were screened for their protective effects against chronic PTZ-induced kindling. Chronic subconvulsive PTZ administration increased the convulsive activity, ultimately leading to generalized tonic-clonic seizures as indicated by a progressive rise in the seizure score, changes in endogenous antioxidants, and changes in inflammatory cytokines. Intervention with LAB6, but not LAB19, significantly attenuated these alterations and beneficially modulated gut health by increasing the production of short-chain fatty acids and promoting healthy gut microbes, suggesting strain-specific effects of LAB6. Further, colonization study with indocyanine green (ICG) labeled LAB6 was done, followed by dose-dependent protective efficacy of LAB6 in PTZ-induced kindling. A single dose administration (10<sup>10</sup> CFU) showed that LAB6 translocated and adhered throughout the gastrointestinal (GI) tract within 8 h of administration and reached the distal colon and cecum. The supplementation of LAB6 at a medium dose of 2 × 10<sup>10</sup> CFU was most efficient in restoring altered gut barrier functions, behavioral deficits, and modulation of peripheral GABA levels. Hence, it is a promising psychobiotic candidate for positively modulating gut-brain functions in epilepsy.",Journal of neurochemistry,2025.0,Tushar Matta; Mahendra Bishnoi; Shiwangi Gupta; Aanchal Aggarwal; Kanwaljit Chopra; Kanthi Kiran Kondepudi,understand communication gut brain emerge new research avenue neurological disorder like epilepsy increase evidence pointing influence intestinal microbe central nervous system protective effect psychobiotic strain levilactobacillus brevis lab6 mtcc 25662 supplementation pentylenetetrazole ptz)-induce kindling male sprague dawley rat study gaba produce strain levilactobacillus brevis lab6 limosilactobacillus fermentum lab19 screen protective effect chronic ptz induce kindling chronic subconvulsive ptz administration increase convulsive activity ultimately lead generalized tonic clonic seizure indicate progressive rise seizure score change endogenous antioxidant change inflammatory cytokine intervention lab6 lab19 significantly attenuate alteration beneficially modulate gut health increase production short chain fatty acid promote healthy gut microbe suggest strain specific effect lab6 colonization study indocyanine green icg label lab6 follow dose dependent protective efficacy lab6 ptz induce kindling single dose administration 10 < sup>10</sup > cfu show lab6 translocate adhere gastrointestinal gi tract 8 h administration reach distal colon cecum supplementation lab6 medium dose 2 × 10 < sup>10</sup > cfu efficient restore altered gut barrier function behavioral deficit modulation peripheral gaba level promising psychobiotic candidate positively modulate gut brain function epilepsy
40566959,The transfer process from child and adolescent mental health services to adult mental health services for patients with childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorders: first case-control study from Türkiye.,"The transfer from child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) to adult mental health services (AMHS) can be challenging, particularly for adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) requiring long-term follow-up. To examine the transfer process from CAMHS to AMHS in a university hospital in Türkiye, focusing on challenges, service gaps and barriers to transfer for individuals with NDDs. Hospital records of children with NDDs followed in CAMHS for at least 5 years were reviewed. Children with at least one annual admission until 2017-2018 were included. A total of 211 patients were categorised into two groups: those who transferred to AMHS by 2018-2019 (transferred group, 81 patients) and those who did not transfer (non-transferred group, 130 patients). Clinical features, such as primary diagnosis and treatments, were compared, and parental views on the transfer process were collected via telephone interviews. The transferred group included 81 patients (38.4%), whereas the non-transferred group had 130 patients (61.6%). Of the total sample, 55 (26.1%) were female, and 156 (73.9%) were male. Primary diagnoses were similar between groups; however, the transferred group had more comorbidities (<i>P</i> < 0.001) and more frequent antipsychotic prescriptions (<i>P</i> = 0.006). Proactive information from CAMHS doctors (<i>B</i> = 2.46, s.e. = 0.68, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and psychiatric comorbidities predicted transfer. In addition, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder diagnoses changed during transfer in the transferred group (<i>P</i> = 0.002).

40566953,Epilepsy and psychosis: navigating through a complex intersection.,"The prevalence of psychiatric disorders in people with epilepsy is as high as 43% and, among them, psychoses represent a severe comorbidity. This is a narrative review discussing the interplay between epilepsy and psychosis and identifying challenges in diagnosing and managing psychotic symptoms in epilepsy, focusing on the past 10 years. Articles published between June 2014 and December 2024 were identified through searches in PubMed using the search terms 'psychosis', 'seizure, epilepsy and convulsion', 'epile*', 'seizure*' and 'convuls*'. The association between epilepsy and psychosis was shown to be bidirectional, with people with psychosis being at increased risk of epilepsy. In epilepsy, psychotic symptoms may occur in three clinical scenarios, with clinical presentation and management varying in relationship to these: seizure-related (peri-ictal), treatment-related or independent of the former. There are no guidelines for the management of psychotic symptoms in epilepsy, but it is possible to apply policies for the treatment of psychoses, taking into account the peculiarities and needs of people with epilepsy.",BJPsych open,2025.0,Marco Mula; Andres M Kanner; Allan H Young; Annabella Di Giorgio; Andreas Schulze-Bonhage; Eugen Trinka,prevalence psychiatric disorder people epilepsy high 43 psychose represent severe comorbidity narrative review discuss interplay epilepsy psychosis identify challenge diagnose manage psychotic symptom epilepsy focus past 10 year article publish june 2014 december 2024 identify search pubmed search term psychosis seizure epilepsy convulsion epile seizure convuls association epilepsy psychosis show bidirectional people psychosis increase risk epilepsy epilepsy psychotic symptom occur clinical scenario clinical presentation management vary relationship seizure relate peri ictal treatment relate independent guideline management psychotic symptom epilepsy possible apply policy treatment psychosis take account peculiarity need people epilepsy
40566951,Critical components of 'Early Intervention in Psychosis': national retrospective cohort study.,"Psychotic disorders are severe mental health conditions frequently associated with long-term disability, reduced quality of life and premature mortality. Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) services aim to provide timely, comprehensive packages of care for people with psychotic disorders. However, it is not clear which components of EIP services contribute most to the improved outcomes they achieve. We aimed to identify associations between specific components of EIP care and clinically significant outcomes for individuals treated for early psychosis in England. This national retrospective cohort study of 14 874 EIP individuals examined associations between 12 components of EIP care and outcomes over a 3-year follow-up period, by linking data from the National Clinical Audit of Psychosis (NCAP) to routine health outcome data held by NHS England. The primary outcome was time to relapse, defined as psychiatric inpatient admission or referral to a crisis resolution (home treatment) team. Secondary outcomes included duration of admissions, detention under the Mental Health Act, emergency department and general hospital attendances and mortality. We conducted multilevel regression analyses incorporating demographic and service-level covariates. Smaller care coordinator case-loads and the use of clozapine for eligible people were associated with reduced relapse risk. Physical health interventions were associated with reductions in mortality risk. Other components, such as cognitive-behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp), showed associations with improvements in secondary outcomes. Smaller case-loads should be prioritised and protected in EIP service design and delivery. Initiatives to improve the uptake of clozapine should be integrated into EIP care. Other components, such as CBTp and physical health interventions, may have specific benefits for those eligible. These findings highlight impactful components of care and should guide resource allocation to optimise EIP service delivery.",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,2025.0,Ryan Williams; Ed Penington; Veenu Gupta; Alan Quirk; Apostolos Tsiachristas; Michelle Rickett; Carolyn A Chew-Graham; David Shiers; Paul French; Belinda Lennox; Alex Bottle; Mike J Crawford,psychotic disorder severe mental health condition frequently associate long term disability reduce quality life premature mortality early intervention psychosis eip service aim provide timely comprehensive package care people psychotic disorder clear component eip service contribute improved outcome achieve aim identify association specific component eip care clinically significant outcome individual treat early psychosis england national retrospective cohort study 14 874 eip individual examine association 12 component eip care outcome 3 year follow period link datum national clinical audit psychosis ncap routine health outcome datum hold nhs england primary outcome time relapse define psychiatric inpatient admission referral crisis resolution home treatment team secondary outcome include duration admission detention mental health act emergency department general hospital attendance mortality conduct multilevel regression analysis incorporate demographic service level covariate small care coordinator case load use clozapine eligible people associate reduce relapse risk physical health intervention associate reduction mortality risk component cognitive behavioural therapy psychosis cbtp show association improvement secondary outcome small case load prioritise protect eip service design delivery initiative improve uptake clozapine integrate eip care component cbtp physical health intervention specific benefit eligible finding highlight impactful component care guide resource allocation optimise eip service delivery
40566933,Qishiwei Zhenzhu Pills Protect Against Cerebral Ischemia via the P53/Cytochrome C/Apoptotic Protease Activating Factor 1-Mediated Mitochondrial Apoptosis Pathway.,"Qishiwei Zhenzhu pills (QSWZZP, Tibetan name: ) originated from Ershiwuwei Zhenzhu mother pills in the eighth century AD and are currently included in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2020). QSWZZP calm the mind, activate the medians, regulate qi, and harmonize the blood. QSWZZP have significant therapeutic effects in cerebral ischemia. However, QSWZZP's complex and diverse multi-herb chemical composition has presented challenges in identifying their active ingredients, which have hitherto remained unclarified. Therefore, the present study focusses on the identification of QSWZZP's active ingredients and their therapeutic mechanisms. To analyze the distribution of QSWZZP's components in the blood and tissues for the treatment of cerebral ischemia, to identify the biomarkers after drug intervention, and to explore the mechanism of action of QSWZZP in terms of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used for qualitative and metabolomic analysis of the distribution of QSWZZP's components in the blood and tissues. A middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model was used to evaluate and measure neurobehavioral changes, the ratio of cerebral infarction, the rate of apoptosis-positive cells in the brain tissue, and the pathological changes in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and diencephalon. mRNA, protein, and fluorescence expressions of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), P53, cytochrome C (Cyt C), apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (APAF-1), cleaved caspase-8, B-cell lymphoma-extra-large, and N-myc downstream-regulated gene family member 4 (NDRG4) were determined in the rat brain tissues via real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and immunofluorescence. In addition, molecular docking was used to screen the active components of QSWZZP against mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Thirty-three new compounds were identified, including 13 triterpenoids and nine flavonoids. Among them, 15 blood-entry, 21 urine-entry, three brain-entry, seven liver-entry, and four kidney-entry components were identified. QSWZZP significantly improved neurobehavioral abnormalities and reduced the cerebral infarction rate in the MCAO rats by significantly decreasing AIF, P53, Cyt C, APAF-1, and cleaved caspase-8 mRNA expressions and Cyt C and APAF-1 protein expressions, as well as increasing NDRG4 protein expression in the rat brain tissues. Molecular docking revealed that the active ingredients of QSWZZP against mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis were arjunic acid, cholic acid, and phyllaemblic acid. In this study, 45 components of QSWZZP were qualitatively analyzed, and the metabolic pathways of the related products were clarified. The potential treatment mechanism of QSWZZP may be related to the modulation of the folate biosynthesis metabolic and P53/Cyt C/APAF-1-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis pathways.

Electroacupuncture (EA) was shown to have the potential to promote the recovery of consciousness. This trial aims to explore the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of EA in patients with DOC due to traumatic brain injury (TBI) through a multimodal approach. A total of 50 adult patients with DOC due to TBI and 25 healthy subjects will be enrolled in the study. Patients enrolled in the study will be assigned to the EA group or the sham-EA group through stratified randomization. All patients receive behavioral assessments (CRS-R and brain-computer interface), neurophysiological evaluations (EEG, somatosensory evoked potentials, brainstem auditory evoked potentials), and neuroimaging evaluations (rs-fMRI, amide proton transfer, intravoxel incoherent motion, neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging) before and after the 14-day EA or sham-EA treatment. Each healthy subject will receive a set of neurophysiological and neuroimaging examinations but no treatments. The practitioner administering EA and sham-EA is the only one aware of the grouping results. In the sham-EA group, sham-acupoints, sham-acupuncture, and sham-wire are utilized. The primary outcome measurement is the change in CRS-R score after 14 days of treatment compared with the baseline CRS-R score.

40566929,Successful Conservative Treatment of Tracheobronchial Injury as a Complication After Emergency Tracheal Intubation in an Infant: A Case Report.,"BACKGROUND Tracheal intubation is a routine but potentially hazardous procedure, with complications ranging from mild mucosal injury to severe tracheobronchial trauma. Tracheobronchial injuries are particularly critical, with high morbidity and mortality rates, necessitating prompt diagnosis and appropriate management. However, there is no clear consensus on optimal treatment, especially in pediatric patients. CASE REPORT We present a case of a previously healthy 11-month-old girl who developed a tracheobronchial injury following endotracheal intubation for status epilepticus. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 6×4 mm tracheobronchial injury, left pneumothorax, and mediastinal emphysema. Given the minor nature of the injury, stable respiratory status, and the expectation of early extubation, conservative management was selected. The patient was treated with nasal intubation, antibacterial therapy, and close monitoring. She was successfully extubated on the second day and discharged on the tenth day without complications. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the importance of recognizing tracheobronchial injury as a potential intubation-related complication, especially in infants with fragile airway anatomy. Key factors contributing to the injury included deep tube insertion, inappropriate tube size, and elevated cuff pressure. Our experience suggests that conservative management can be a viable option in select cases of pediatric tracheobronchial injury when symptoms are minimal and early extubation is feasible. Additionally, meticulous intubation techniques, proper tube selection, and experienced personnel are critical in preventing such complications. Further studies are needed to establish standardized guidelines for managing tracheobronchial injuries in infants and young children.",The American journal of case reports,2025.0,Kazuki Kikuchi; Keisuke Suzuki; Kanako Sugo; Yoshitaka Tomita; Takuya Shimada; Manabu Eiraku; Chihiro Mori; Mariko Kurihara; Hiroki Yamaga; Gen Inoue; Masaharu Yagi; Kenji Dohi,background tracheal intubation routine potentially hazardous procedure complication range mild mucosal injury severe tracheobronchial trauma tracheobronchial injury particularly critical high morbidity mortality rate necessitate prompt diagnosis appropriate management clear consensus optimal treatment especially pediatric patient case report present case previously healthy 11 month old girl develop tracheobronchial injury follow endotracheal intubation status epilepticus computed tomography ct reveal 6×4 mm tracheobronchial injury leave pneumothorax mediastinal emphysema give minor nature injury stable respiratory status expectation early extubation conservative management select patient treat nasal intubation antibacterial therapy close monitoring successfully extubate second day discharge tenth day complication conclusion case highlight importance recognize tracheobronchial injury potential intubation relate complication especially infant fragile airway anatomy key factor contribute injury include deep tube insertion inappropriate tube size elevated cuff pressure experience suggest conservative management viable option select case pediatric tracheobronchial injury symptom minimal early extubation feasible additionally meticulous intubation technique proper tube selection experienced personnel critical prevent complication study need establish standardized guideline manage tracheobronchial injury infant young child
40566924,Examining Brain Function Changes in HIV-Infected Patients With Asymptomatic Neurocognitive Impairment: A Longitudinal Study.,"HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), especially asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), the initial stage of HAND, persist among a substantial proportion of individuals living with HIV despite the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) focusing on ANI among HIV-related patients is rarely reported. 60 right-handed Chinese male patients with HIV-associated ANI underwent baseline and follow-up neurocognitive examination, and rs-fMRI scans over an average interval of 1.68 years. Brain function alterations were evaluated through amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF/fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and functional connectivity (FC) analyses. In this study, significant reductions in ALFF were observed in the MOG, cuneus, superior frontal gyrus, and supplementary motor area in the follow-up group compared to baseline. This was accompanied by increased ALFF in the right insula. ReHo analysis revealed decreased values in the left median cingulate, right calcarine fissure, MOG, and left precentral gyrus, alongside increased ReHo in the supramarginal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and calcarine fissure. FC analysis demonstrated decreased connectivity between the precentral gyrus and calcarine cortex and between the MOG and calcarine cortex.

40566894,Transcriptional Landscape and Biomarker Discovery for Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Alzheimer's Disease: An Ex Vivo Study Using Patients-Derived Dermal Fibroblasts.,"Numerous studies have identified various risk factors associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the experimental limitations of disease modeling make it challenging to directly interpret their effects. These limitations include constraints of postmortem samples, animal experiments, and challenges associated with brain tissue studies. Ex vivo experiments effectively address these issues by enabling patient-specific identification and highlighting potential biomarkers. This study aimed to characterize the transcriptional profile of fibroblasts derived from patients with AD in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and propose potential biomarkers. We utilized an ex vivo platform to identify genes differentially responsive to ER stress. The transcriptional feature of fibroblasts in both healthy controls (n=22) and patients with AD (n=20) was analyzed using bulk RNA sequencing. The cytotoxicity of the selected target gene was evaluated through knockdown experiments. A total of 468 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that 210 DEGs, which were less responsive in AD, are involved in lipid-related terms and pathways. By narrowing down AD-related genes, we identified 49 highly reliable AD-associated genes. The most significant gene, DCTN2, exhibited a fold change that positively correlated with cognitive function and negatively correlated with blood-based biomarkers (pTau217, amyloid beta 42/40 ratio), aligning with the amyloid/Tau/neurodegeneration research criteria for AD. Additionally, the knockdown of DCTN2 in glial cell lines resulted in increased cell toxicity and apoptosis. Identifying differentially responsive genes in ex vivo experiments not only provides insights into the pathology of AD but also offers potential biomarkers for disease diagnosis.",Psychiatry investigation,2025.0,Yeojin Kim; You Jin Nam; Sunwoo Yoon; Young Joon Cho; Ho Min Song; Seongmin Kim; Donghyuk Shin; Jin Young Noh; Sun Min Lee; So Young Moon; Eun-Joo Kim; Soo Hyun Cho; Byeong C Kim; Seong Hye Choi; Sang Won Seo; Jin Wook Choi; Young-Sil An; Bumhee Park; Young Joon Park; Hee Young Kang; Hyun Goo Woo; Yong Hyuk Cho; Sunhwa Hong; Sang Joon Son; Sang-Rae Lee; Chang Hyung Hong; Hyun Woong Roh,numerous study identify risk factor associate alzheimer disease ad experimental limitation disease modeling challenge directly interpret effect limitation include constraint postmortem sample animal experiment challenge associate brain tissue study ex vivo experiment effectively address issue enable patient specific identification highlight potential biomarker study aim characterize transcriptional profile fibroblast derive patient ad response endoplasmic reticulum er stress propose potential biomarker utilize ex vivo platform identify gene differentially responsive er stress transcriptional feature fibroblast healthy control n=22 patient ad n=20 analyze bulk rna sequence cytotoxicity select target gene evaluate knockdown experiment total 468 differentially express gene deg identify gene ontology pathway enrichment analysis reveal 210 deg responsive ad involve lipid relate term pathway narrow ad relate gene identify 49 highly reliable ad associate gene significant gene dctn2 exhibit fold change positively correlate cognitive function negatively correlate blood base biomarker ptau217 amyloid beta 42/40 ratio align amyloid tau neurodegeneration research criterion ad additionally knockdown dctn2 glial cell line result increase cell toxicity apoptosis identify differentially responsive gene ex vivo experiment provide insight pathology ad offer potential biomarker disease diagnosis
40566889,"Post-Infection Insomnia, Dysfunctional Beliefs About Sleep, and Depression in the COVID-19-Infected General Population.","This study aimed to explore the feasibility of the cognitive-behavioral model of COVID-19-related hypochondriasis among participants infected with the virus, with specific consideration of insomnia severity. Additionally, factors predicting post-infection insomnia were examined in participants without pre-existing sleep disturbances pre-COVID-19 infection. An online study was conducted involving the general population infected with COVID-19. Data were collected on COVID-19 and participants' psychiatric and sleep disorder histories. Self-rating scales utilized included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Obsession with COVID-19 Scale (OCS), Coronavirus Reassurance-Seeking Behaviors Scale (CRBS), Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemic-6 items (SAVE-6), Patient Health Questionnaire-2 items (PHQ-2), and Dysfunctional Beliefs about Sleep-2 items (DBS-2). Among the 260 participants infected with COVID-19, mediation analysis revealed that SAVE-6 had a direct influence on OCS, while CRBS mediated this effect. Furthermore, a separate mediation model demonstrated that the impact of ISI on OCS was mediated by CRBS, PHQ-2, and SAVE-6. Logistic regression analysis conducted on 211 participants without prior sleep disturbances indicated that past psychiatric history, DBS-2, and PHQ-2 served as predictive factors for post-COVID sleep disorders. This study established a feasible hypochondriasis model, demonstrating the influence of insomnia on preoccupation with COVID-19, mediated by reassurance-seeking behavior, depression, and viral anxiety.

This study aimed to investigate the associations between childhood trauma, the BIS/BAS, and mood disorders. This study included 1,026 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD, n=338), bipolar I disorder (BD-I, n=152), bipolar II disorder (BD-II, n=536), and 734 comparisons. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ) and BIS/BAS scale were used for evaluation. Differences in the CTQ and BIS/BAS scores among the patient and comparison groups were examined. Patients in the BD-II group had significantly higher total BIS scores than those in the comparison, MDD, and BD-I groups. Patients with BD-I had significantly higher total BAS scores than those with MDD. The CTQ and total BIS scores were positively correlated, and the total BIS scores showed a significant correlation with emotional neglect and emotional abuse subscale scores. In contrast, no correlation was observed between the CTQ and total BAS scores or between MDD and the total BIS/BAS scores.

40566886,Comparative Analysis of Violent Crime Statistics in Korea by Mental Illness Status (2012-2022): Implications of Deinstitutionalization.,"This study examines violent crime trends in South Korea from 2012 to 2022, comparing offenders with and without mental illness. It evaluates the impact of the 2017 amendments to the Mental Health and Welfare Act, which made involuntary psychiatric hospitalization more difficult, on violent crime rates among individuals with mental illness. We analyzed the annual number of violent crime offenders without and with mental illness (psychosis, mental retardation, or other mental disorders) between 2012 and 2022, as provided by the National Police Agency statistics. We compared the total number of offenders between the two groups before and after 2017 when the Mental Health and Welfare Act was implemented. Significant differences in crime trends were found between the groups. Serious violent crimes, such as murder and attempted murder, decreased in both groups. However, robbery rates fell sharply among offenders without mental illness but declined minimally among those with mental illness, increasing their proportional involvement. Arson rates rose significantly post-2017 among offenders with mental illness. While assault and battery decreased in offenders without mental illness, they slightly increased in those with mental illness. Crimes such as threats, vandalism, and confinement also showed more substantial increases among the mentally ill group. Over the past decade, the number and proportion of violent crimes committed by individuals with mental illness have increased relative to those without, suggesting potential unintended consequences of deinstitutionalization.

40566860,Correlation of Positive Signs of Functional Neurological Disorder With Headache Severity: A Prospective Cross-Sectional Study.,"Positive signs are clinical signs that are not explained by a structural neurological lesion and are considered the hallmark of functional neurological disorder (FND). In the literature and in clinical experience, positive signs are observed among patients without FND. The aim of the study was to examine the significance of positive signs among headache patients. The authors of this prospective study recruited patients in headache consultation at the University Hospital Inselspital, Bern, Switzerland. Inclusion criteria were headache or facial pain in the past 3 months and age ≥18 years. The exclusion criterion was a known diagnosis of FND. All patients were examined for 14 validated positive signs: give-way weakness, co-contraction, sternocleidomastoid sign, trapezius elevation test, head flexion test, drift without pronation, Hoover I and II, spinal injury test, arm drop test, lip-pulling sign, midline splitting, splitting of vibration sign at the front, and expressive behavior sign. In total, 101 patients were recruited (69% female; mean±SD age=40.8±16.3 years), of whom 43% showed positive signs. Splitting of vibration was the most common sign (27%); the other signs were less frequent (≤10%). Patients with positive signs were older than patients without such signs and had more monthly headache days and exacerbations as well as more intense headache at examination. Multivariable logistic regression revealed a significant association between positive signs and exacerbation days per month (OR=1.08, 95% CI=1.01-1.14, per exacerbation day; p=0.019). Positive signs are frequent among headache patients and point toward a more severe headache condition.

40566853,The Role of Cannabis Policies and Perceptions of Penalties on the Association Between Adolescent Social Bonds and Cannabis Use.,"Recent shifts in cannabis policies have led to lowered risk perceptions, less disapproval of use, and an increase in use among adolescents. This increase in usage is problematic as heavy cannabis use during adolescence can hinder brain development and increase the likelihood of mental health disorders. As such, it is crucial to understand the factors safeguarding adolescents from cannabis use. Research suggests that social bonds and legal consequences may be protective factors against adolescent cannabis use. However, it remains uncertain whether increased accessibility of cannabis undermines the effectiveness of these protective factors. The current study uses data from the 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health to investigate the impact of state-level medical cannabis policies and perceptions of state-level cannabis possession penalties on past year cannabis use, as well as whether these variables moderate the association between social bonds (attachment, commitment, involvement) and past year cannabis use among adolescents. The results indicate that medical cannabis policies are positively and significantly associated with past year cannabis use, while perception of serious criminal justice penalties for cannabis possession is negatively and significantly associated with past year cannabis use. Additionally, the effects of attachment and involvement differ by medical cannabis policy status, but there was no evidence that perception of penalties moderated the association between social bonds and cannabis use. The results of the current study reveal a need for more education among adolescents on both the health consequences and criminal penalties for cannabis use.",Substance use & misuse,2025.0,Kelsi Moscrop-Blake; Wanda E Leal,recent shift cannabis policy lead lower risk perception disapproval use increase use adolescent increase usage problematic heavy cannabis use adolescence hinder brain development increase likelihood mental health disorder crucial understand factor safeguard adolescent cannabis use research suggest social bond legal consequence protective factor adolescent cannabis use remain uncertain increase accessibility cannabis undermine effectiveness protective factor current study use datum 2023 national survey drug use health investigate impact state level medical cannabis policy perception state level cannabis possession penalty past year cannabis use variable moderate association social bond attachment commitment involvement past year cannabis use adolescent result indicate medical cannabis policy positively significantly associate past year cannabis use perception criminal justice penalty cannabis possession negatively significantly associate past year cannabis use additionally effect attachment involvement differ medical cannabis policy status evidence perception penalty moderate association social bond cannabis use result current study reveal need education adolescent health consequence criminal penalty cannabis use
40566835,Bridging perspectives: The value of collaboration between Traditional Healing Practitioners and Medical Doctors in dementia research and care in South Africa.,"Traditional Healing Practitioners (THPs) provide care to the majority of the population in South Africa. Despite their widespread presence, they remain largely excluded from dementia research and policy. This reinforces healthcare inequities and overlooks the realities of communities where THPs provide care. This paper explores the role of THPs in dementia care by examining literature in South Africa. It identifies key barriers to collaboration between THPs and medical doctors and discusses pathways for integration. Barriers include epistemological historical marginalization, mutual distrust, fragmented care pathways, and language barriers. These challenges hinder knowledge exchange and joint dementia care strategies. Strengthening relationships through structured engagement, bidirectional knowledge exchange, and ethical collaboration could bridge the gap between THPs and Medical Doctors (MDs). A pluralistic, integrated model valuing both systems could lead to more equitable and effective dementia care. The majority of people in South Africa engage with Traditional Healing Practitioners (THPs) as part of their healthcare, yet THPs remain largely excluded from dementia research and policy. Barriers to collaboration between THPs and Medical Doctors (MDs) include historical marginalization, mutual distrust, fragmented care pathways, and language differences. Integrating THPs and MDs through structured engagement, bidirectional knowledge exchange, and ethical collaboration could enhance dementia care.

40566828,"Comparative Risk of Developing Interstitial Cystitis With Childhood Gastrointestinal, Urological, Autoimmune, or Psychiatric Disorders.","Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a chronic urological condition associated with significant discomfort, posing diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Although its etiology remains unclear, early-life conditions such as gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, urological anomalies (UA), psychiatric disorders (PD), and autoimmune diseases (AD) have been hypothesized as potential risk factors for developing IC in adulthood. This study aims to investigate these associations by conducting a retrospective cohort analysis utilizing data from the TriNetX US Collaborative Network, encompassing over 118 million patient records. The study and control groups were established across four categories of childhood disorders, with IC incidence monitored over a 14-year period. Statistical methodologies, including propensity score matching and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, were employed to compare outcomes between cohorts. Findings indicate that childhood GI and UA conditions significantly elevate the risk of IC in adulthood, with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and urinary tract infections (UTIs) exhibiting risk ratios of 2.9 and 3.2, respectively. Gender disparities were also noted, with females exhibiting higher incidences of diseases included, particularly UA and AD during adolescence. Additionally, individuals with these early-life conditions demonstrated a higher prevalence of comorbidities, underscoring the complex interplay of health factors contributing to IC pathogenesis. These findings suggest that childhood GI and UA conditions may serve as predictive markers for IC, emphasizing the need for targeted early interventions and preventative care strategies. By identifying at-risk populations, this study provides valuable insights into early detection and management approaches, potentially mitigating the long-term burden of IC on affected individuals.

Using two independent cohorts (n = 1810), we assessed the relationship of plasma NfL and GFAP with (1) vascular brain indices; (2) diagnostic states using the following definitions: vascular versus not (white matter hyperintensity/total intracranial volume ≥ 1.3%), and cognitively impaired (CI) versus cognitively unimpaired (CU) using Clinical Dementia Rating ([CDR] scale ≥ 0.5); and (3) their upstream predictors using structural equation models (SEMs). Plasma NfL and GFAP were associated with vascular brain damage and differed across states (VCI > vascular CU > non-vascular CI > non-vascular CU). In a population-based sample, these biomarkers distinguished vascular CU and VCI from non-vascular CU groups with greater separation in amyloid negative participants. Pathway analyses showed NfL was primarily influenced by systemic/brain vascular health, whereas amyloid contributed to GFAP variability. Plasma biomarkers, particularly NfL, capture vascular brain changes and show promise for VCI identification. Plasma NfL and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were associated with vascular brain indices.

The therapy aims at alleviating memory and cognitive circuit dysfunction. In preclinical models of AD, electrical stimulation of the memory circuit has demonstrated a possible disease-modifying potential. Here we examined changes resulting from fx-DBS in hippocampal atrophy and amyloid accumulation in AD patients with fx-DBS. Repeated magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) images acquired over the course of 12 months were used to assess changes in hippocampal volume in 36 ADvance trial patients compared to 40 matched untreated AD patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, and in 10 separate patients with repeated flutemetamol PET and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers. We observed a reduction of hippocampal atrophy and amyloid beta (Aβ) PET binding, and an increase in the CSF Aβ/total-tau ratio in DBS patients. These findings highlight the potential of fornix deep brain stimulation to modify AD biomarkers and possibly progression in some patients.

We planned to enroll 48 participants with 2:1 randomization to 10 mg dapagliflozin once daily (n = 32) versus matching placebo (n = 16). The primary objective was the effect of dapagliflozin on cerebral N-acetylaspartate (NAA). We also assessed safety, glycemic control, body composition, brain metabolism, and cognition. There was no change in the primary outcome. There were no significant adverse event differences. Hemoglobin A1c, fat mass, and fat-free lean mass decreased; brain glutathione increased; and Stroop Interference test (but not other cognitive test) performance improved. Treated participants manifested metabolic effects observed in clinical studies of other cohorts. In AD, dapagliflozin use may affect the brain. Dapagliflozin did not alter magnetic resonance spectroscopy N-acetylaspartate (primary outcome) in this exploratory Alzheimer's disease (AD) trial.

40566790,Associations between objective sleep metrics and brain structure in cognitively unimpaired adults: interactions with sex and Alzheimer's biomarkers.,"Sleep disturbances are prevalent in Alzheimer's disease (AD), probably emerging during its preclinical stage. Poor subjective sleep quality is linked to reduced brain volume and cortical thickness (CTh), but associations with objective sleep measures, particularly regarding sex and AD pathology, remain unclear. We characterized 171 cognitively unimpaired adults from the ALzheimer and FAmilies (ALFA) Sleep study using actigraphy, MRI, amyloid beta 42/40, and phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 in cerebrospinal fluid. Lower sleep efficiency, higher wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep fragmentation were associated with lower CTh in the medial temporal lobe and other regions linked with AD and sleep disruption, even after adjusting for AD biomarkers. Sex and AD biomarkers modified these associations, with longer WASO showing a stronger correlation with lower CTh in females. Disrupted sleep may reduce cortical integrity independently of AD biomarkers, suggesting alternative pathways. Females appear more vulnerable to impaired sleep, and AD pathology may exacerbate AD-related changes in CTh. Poor sleep efficiency, increased WASO, and sleep fragmentation are associated with reduced CTh in regions vulnerable to early AD, independently of amyloid and tau pathology. In the presence of AD pathology, this relationship is altered, with A+T+ individuals exhibiting increased CTh associated with sleep disruption. Sex-specific effects suggest females are more vulnerable to sleep-related cortical thinning.

40566787,[The research progress on the improvement effect of repeated peripheral magnetic stimulation on upper limb and lower limb spasm after stroke].,"Post-stroke spasticity, a common sequelae of upper motor neuron lesions, results in motor control deficits and pathological hypertonia that not only reduce patients' activities of daily living but may also cause impairment of adaptive neuroplasticity. Repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (rPMS), as a novel non-invasive neuromodulation technique, demonstrates unique clinical potential through targeted modulation of electromagnetic coupling effects in the peripheral neuromuscular system. Although current international studies have validated the therapeutic potential of rPMS for spasticity, significant heterogeneity persists in elucidating its mechanisms of action, optimizing parameter protocols, and standardizing outcome assessment systems. This review innovatively synthesized recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and mechanistic evidence, systematically summarizing rPMS-mediated multidimensional intervention paradigms for upper- and lower-limb spasticity. It rigorously examined the correlations between stimulation frequency parameters (low-frequency <i>vs.</i> high-frequency), anatomical targeting (nerve trunk <i>vs</i>. motor point), and clinical outcomes including spasticity severity, motor function, and quality of life.

This paper aims to review on the brain mechanism of upper limb motor dysfunction in stroke patients and the improvement of brain function in those receiving BCI training, aiming to further explore the brain mechanism of BCI in promoting the rehabilitation of upper limb motor function after stroke. The results of this study show that in the fields of imaging and electrophysiology, abnormal activity and connectivity have been found in stroke patients. And BCI training for stroke patients can improve their upper limb motor function by increasing the activity and connectivity of one hemisphere of the brain and restoring the balance between the bilateral hemispheres of the brain.

Combining multi-modal technologies and brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigms can assist in identifying patients with minimally conscious state (MCS) and vegetative state (VS). This study collected electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals under motor BCI paradigms from 14 DOC patients, who were divided into two groups based on clinical scores: 7 in the MCS group and 7 in the VS group. We calculated event-related desynchronization (ERD) and motor decoding accuracy to analyze the effectiveness of motor BCI paradigms in detecting consciousness states. The results showed that the classification accuracies for left-hand and right-hand movement tasks using EEG were 93.28% and 76.19% for the MCS and VS groups, respectively; the classification precisions using fNIRS were 53.72% and 49.11% for these groups. When combining EEG and fNIRS features, the classification accuracies for left-hand and right-hand movement tasks in the MCS and VS groups were 95.56% and 87.38%, respectively.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of exercise preconditioning on motor deficits and mitochondrial function in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model. Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into four groups: sedentary + saline (SS), sedentary + MPTP (SM), exercise + saline (ES), and exercise + MPTP (EM) groups. Mice in the ES and EM groups received 4 weeks of treadmill training, and then SM and EM groups were treated with MPTP for 5 days. Motor function was assessed by behavioral tests, and morphological and functional changes in dopaminergic neurons and mitochondria in the substantia nigra of the midbrain were evaluated using immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and transmission electron microscopy technology. The results showed that, compared with the SM group, the EM group exhibited significantly improved motor ability, up-regulated protein expression levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) in the midbrain, and down-regulated protein expression of α-synuclein (α-Syn) in the mitochondria of substantia nigra.

However, its significance is often overlooked in neurological clinics. We review the literature and draw from our own experience to offer a practical approach for assessing and managing sexual health issues in patients with movement disorders. We begin by introducing fundamental concepts of sexual medicine, emphasizing models of sexual response that offer useful frameworks for diagnostic classification and management practices. We then address the most common sexual problems and disorders, including sexual dysfunction, sexual pain disorders, sexual compulsivity, and paraphilic behaviors, and their connections to different movement disorders. Next, we discuss assessment approaches that encompass biological, psychological, and social factors related to sexual health, including investigations for structural, vascular, or hormonal causes. Brief assessment questionnaires are also discussed. In addition to specific sexual therapeutic practices and supportive psychotherapy, we cover adjustments to pharmacological treatments related to movement disorders, as well as the use of mechanical devices. We also address the need for individualized management in specific cases, such as for patients undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery. Neurologists can play a key role in addressing sexual health concerns, considering the impact of both the disorder and its treatments.

40566678,Voltage Gating and 4-aminopyridine Inhibition in Shaker Kv Channel Revealed by Closed-State Model.,"The generation and propagation of action potentials in neurons relies on the coordinated activation of voltage-dependent sodium and potassium channels. The Kv1 (Shaker) family of potassium channels drives the repolarization phase of the action potential by opening and closing their pore, a process controlled by a voltage sensor domain. However, a molecular description of how the voltage sensor domain drives pore gating has been constrained by a lack of closed-state structures. Here, we present a structural model of the closed Shaker channel that reveals the structural basis of voltage gating. Using AlphaFold2-based conformational sampling, we identified a partially activated state of the voltage sensor which, when modeled with the full channel, produced a closed state. Based on this model we demonstrate that breaking a backbone hydrogen bond between the S4-S5 linker and S5 helices is a critical part of the activation pathway. Docking studies revealed a hydrophobic cavity in the closed pore that binds 4-aminopyridine, a potassium channel inhibitor used to enhance nerve conduction in multiple sclerosis. Our results demonstrate how the voltage sensor movement drives pore opening and provide a structural framework for developing new therapeutic agents targeting the closed state. We anticipate that the novel methods used in this work will allow the characterization of conformational dynamics in voltage-gated ion channels, enabling drug design efforts focused on state-dependent modulation of ion channels for neurological disorders treatment.",Biophysical journal,2025.0,Bernardo I Pinto-Anwandter,generation propagation action potential neuron rely coordinate activation voltage dependent sodium potassium channel kv1 shaker family potassium channel drive repolarization phase action potential opening close pore process control voltage sensor domain molecular description voltage sensor domain drive pore gating constrain lack closed state structure present structural model close shaker channel reveal structural basis voltage gating alphafold2 base conformational sampling identify partially activate state voltage sensor model channel produce closed state base model demonstrate break backbone hydrogen bond s4 s5 linker s5 helix critical activation pathway docking study reveal hydrophobic cavity closed pore bind 4 aminopyridine potassium channel inhibitor enhance nerve conduction multiple sclerosis result demonstrate voltage sensor movement drive pore opening provide structural framework develop new therapeutic agent target closed state anticipate novel method work allow characterization conformational dynamic voltage gate ion channel enable drug design effort focus state dependent modulation ion channel neurological disorder treatment

Second, to identify patient groups based on their characteristics using cluster analysis. A cross-sectional study. Seventy-eight patients with stroke. The Frontal Assessment Battery, Mini-Mental State Examination, Trail Making Test, and Stroop Color Word Test were performed within 5 days. Based on principal component analysis, the Frontal Assessment Battery was classified into cognitive control (subscales 1-3, 5) and behavioural control (subscales 4 and 6). Two clusters that reflect these components (cluster 1, n = 68; cluster 2, n = 10) were identified. The between-group comparison showed that compared with cluster 1, cluster 2 had lower scores on Frontal Assessment Battery subscales 4 and 6, the Frontal Assessment Battery total scores, and other executive functions scores.

Cross-sectional observational study. 238 participants (119 stroke survivors and 119 healthy individuals matched for age and sex). Participants were assessed using the 6-minute walk test and the 2-minute walk test in Belgium and Vietnam. Stroke survivors were assessed in the acute and subacute phases (17 days post-stroke) and reassessed after 1-3 days. The 6-minute walk test and the 2-minute walk test showed high test-retest reliability (ICC > 0.96). The difference between the two tests was not significant in terms of walking distance reduction in stroke survivors relative to healthy participants (1.4%), not clinically meaningful for walking speed (0.026 m/s), and not significant in chronotropic response (1.6 bpm). The correlation between the 2 tests in stroke survivors was high (r = 0.93) and walking distance was moderately related to height, weight, and phase, and type of stroke (p < 0.05).

40566647,Obstructive Hydrocephalus Caused by Tumefactive Perivascular Spaces: A Case Report.,"BACKGROUND Perivascular spaces (PS), often called Virchow-Robin spaces, are fluid-filled regions surrounding the brain's blood vessels, typically benign and detected incidentally on MRI scans. However, their enlargement, termed tumefactive PS, is rare and poses significant diagnostic challenges, potentially mimicking severe intracranial conditions. Accurate identification is critical, as these expanded spaces can lead to serious clinical outcomes like hydrocephalus or brain herniation. Misinterpretation of imaging can result in incorrect diagnoses and unwarranted procedures. This case report highlights a rare instance where tumefactive PS caused obstructive hydrocephalus, underscoring the necessity for precise diagnosis. CASE REPORT We report a case involving a 66-year-old Hispanic female with a complex medical history, including insulin-dependent diabetes, prior stroke, and post-Whipple's procedure for pancreatic cancer, who was admitted with progressive somnolence. Initial evaluations indicated encephalopathy. Advanced imaging with CT and MRI identified significantly enlarged PS near the third and fourth ventricles, causing obstructive ventriculomegaly. Differential diagnoses considered cystic tumors and infections, yet MRI findings - cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) isointensity and lack of contrast enhancement - confirmed tumefactive PS. A ventriculoatrial shunt was considered, but the patient's condition rapidly worsened due to sepsis and an intraperitoneal abscess, culminating in multi-organ failure and death before surgery. CONCLUSIONS Although rare, tumefactive PS can mimic serious intracranial diseases, necessitating careful MRI evaluation to differentiate these benign spaces from more severe pathologies. Key MRI indicators include alignment with penetrating vessels, absence of enhancement, and CSF signal intensity. Misdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary surgical interventions, emphasizing the importance of accurate imaging interpretation. In symptomatic cases, usually due to mass effect, surgical intervention might be required.

40566573,Psychiatric Implications of Genetic Variations in Oligodendrocytes: Insights from hiPSC Models.,"Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are a dynamic and heterogeneous population of glial cells essential for brain development and myelination. Beyond their well-established role in oligodendrogenesis, emerging evidence suggests that OPCs contribute to synaptic regulation, neuronal communication, and brain plasticity. Recent studies have increasingly implicated OPC dysfunction in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD). This narrative review integrates clinical, genetic, transcriptomic, and histological findings to examine the role of OPC alterations in mental illnesses. In SCZ, OPC abnormalities predominantly affect myelination, but recent data also suggest deficits in non-canonical functions, including neuron-OPC communication. Findings in BD largely mirror those in SCZ, implying shared OPC-related mechanisms across these disorders. In contrast, OPC involvement in MDD appears more complex, with evidence supporting both myelination deficits and non-canonical dysfunctions, such as impaired neuro-glial interactions and perineuronal network alterations. The developmental timing of OPC dysfunction may represent a common denominator underlying psychiatric disorders, as early-life stress and neurodevelopmental disturbances have been linked to OPC impairments. Moreover, given the shared developmental origins of OPCs and parvalbumin-positive interneurons, disruptions in their mutual interactions may contribute to broader neural network dysregulation. Despite these insights, the field remains in its infancy. Future studies integrating independent human cohorts with robust preclinical models are needed to clarify the extent of OPC involvement in psychiatric pathophysiology. Understanding OPC dysfunction may reveal novel biomarkers and open new avenues for individualized therapeutic interventions and preventive strategies in mental health.","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2025.0,Martina D'Angelo; Valeria Di Stefano; Ilaria Pullano; Francesco Monaco; Luca Steardo,oligodendrocyte precursor cell opc dynamic heterogeneous population glial cell essential brain development myelination establish role oligodendrogenesis emerge evidence suggest opc contribute synaptic regulation neuronal communication brain plasticity recent study increasingly implicate opc dysfunction pathophysiology psychiatric disorder particularly schizophrenia scz bipolar disorder bd major depressive disorder mdd narrative review integrate clinical genetic transcriptomic histological finding examine role opc alteration mental illness scz opc abnormality predominantly affect myelination recent datum suggest deficit non canonical function include neuron opc communication finding bd largely mirror scz imply share opc relate mechanism disorder contrast opc involvement mdd appear complex evidence support myelination deficit non canonical dysfunction impaired neuro glial interaction perineuronal network alteration developmental timing opc dysfunction represent common denominator underlie psychiatric disorder early life stress neurodevelopmental disturbance link opc impairment give share developmental origin opc parvalbumin positive interneuron disruption mutual interaction contribute broad neural network dysregulation despite insight field remain infancy future study integrate independent human cohort robust preclinical model need clarify extent opc involvement psychiatric pathophysiology understand opc dysfunction reveal novel biomarker open new avenue individualized therapeutic intervention preventive strategy mental health
40566488,The Bidirectional Interplay Between Substances of Abuse and Gut Microbiome Homeostasis.,"Specific gut microorganisms and their metabolic by-products have been identified as key regulators of host physiology, contributing to the modulation of the immune system, inflammatory processes, brain function, and behavior, which highlights the gut microbiome as a potential modulator of the neurobiological mechanisms involved in substance use disorders. This narrative review provides an updated overview of how drugs of abuse influence the composition and dynamics of the human gut microbiome and how bacterial dysbiosis may be a contributing factor to substance use disorders by modulating the communication between the gut and the brain. Thus, by examining commonly abused substances such as alcohol, psychostimulants, opioids, cannabinoids, and nicotine, this review aimed to deepen the understanding of the bidirectional relationship between the gut microbiome and substance use. There is evidence indicating that gut microbiome alterations may influence addiction through changes in gut-brain signaling. Furthermore, changes in the gut microbiome and its metabolites may not only result from substance use disorders, but could also modulate behavioral responses to drugs of abuse. Although the exact mechanisms by which the gut microbiome modulates behavioral responses to drugs of abuse are not fully understood, microbial products such as short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan metabolites, bile acids, and neurotransmitters have been suggested to play a role in this process by influencing the blood-brain barrier permeability, host immune activation, neural signaling, and gene expression. Therefore, manipulating the gut microbiome or its by-products may represent a promising approach for enhancing substance use disorder treatments, identifying individuals at increased risk of pathological drug use, and elucidating its role in substance-related behaviors.","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2025.0,Alejandro Borrego-Ruiz; Juan J Borrego,specific gut microorganism metabolic product identify key regulator host physiology contribute modulation immune system inflammatory process brain function behavior highlight gut microbiome potential modulator neurobiological mechanism involve substance use disorder narrative review provide update overview drug abuse influence composition dynamic human gut microbiome bacterial dysbiosis contribute factor substance use disorder modulate communication gut brain examine commonly abuse substance alcohol psychostimulant opioid cannabinoid nicotine review aim deepen understanding bidirectional relationship gut microbiome substance use evidence indicate gut microbiome alteration influence addiction change gut brain signaling furthermore change gut microbiome metabolite result substance use disorder modulate behavioral response drug abuse exact mechanism gut microbiome modulate behavioral response drug abuse fully understand microbial product short chain fatty acid tryptophan metabolite bile acid neurotransmitter suggest play role process influence blood brain barrier permeability host immune activation neural signal gene expression manipulate gut microbiome product represent promising approach enhance substance use disorder treatment identify individual increase risk pathological drug use elucidate role substance relate behavior
40566392,"Nicotine Dependence in a Banned Market: Biomarker Evidence from E-Cigarette Users in São Paulo, Brazil.","Although electronic cigarettes have been banned in Brazil since 2009, their use is increasing, particularly among youth. We conducted a biomarker-based study to profile exclusive e-cigarette users in São Paulo and to examine the associations of e-cigarette use with salivary nicotine and cotinine levels. A population-based, cross-sectional study was conducted between April and September 2024 in six municipalities in São Paulo, Brazil. Randomly selected participants who reported exclusive use of electronic cigarettes completed a questionnaire and provided oral fluid samples for the determination of their nicotine and cotinine concentrations using LC-MS/MS. The cohort consisted of N = 417 participants. Significant associations were found between nicotine and cotinine concentrations and variables such as knowledge of nicotine content and product type. Addiction status significantly influenced the nicotine and cotinine concentrations, as well as smoking history, last consumption, recharge/purchase frequency, and consumption duration (all <i>p</i> < 0.001). Participants who perceived themselves to have a moderate or severe addiction exhibited higher nicotine and cotinine concentrations compared with those who did not perceive that they had an addiction (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Most participants were young, predominantly White, and highly educated and earned higher incomes. The findings reveal a correlation between perceived nicotine dependence and salivary nicotine and cotinine concentrations, underscoring the physiological and behavioral markers of electronic cigarette addiction. High salivary concentrations of nicotine appear to be independent of duration of e-cigarette use, smoking history, and age.

This study investigated the help-seeking behaviours for their relatives by AFM in Brazil, including the characteristics of those who sought help and the risk factors for delaying it. A secondary analysis from a national cross-sectional study of 3030 AFM was performed. Participants were recruited from a range of services focused on AFM across each of the five Brazilian regions (North, Northeast, Central-West, Southeast, South). While 92.7% sought help, 66.0% delayed for an average of 37.2 (SD 70.71) months. Help seeking was associated with higher socioeconomic status and being from the Southeastern region. Barriers included the relative refusing help (31.5%) and the belief that help was not needed (20.6%). Longer delays were associated with female AFM, residents in the Central-West region, non-parents, older RSU, alcohol use, and withdrawal coping strategies.

40566383,Pharmacological and Non-Pharmacological Interventions to Improve Sleep in People with Cognitive Impairment: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Sleep disturbance is common among people with cognitive impairment and, when present, is an important target for intervention because it potentially leads to negative outcomes and cognitive decline. Given this association, sleep represents a potential public health target, although evidence for efficacy is lacking. For this study, a systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken of controlled clinical trials of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to improve sleep in mild cognitive impairment and dementia. A total of 144 trials involving 13,471 participants (median 50 per trial) were included. To measure sleep, 68 trials used subjective measures exclusively, and 41 used only objective measures, while 35 used a combination. In all, 287 discrete sleep outcome measures were reported. Bright light therapy was the most frequently examined non-pharmacological intervention, but results were equivocal. Other non-pharmacological interventions (such as physical activity, cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia, music, and continuous positive airway pressure) showed promise but require further evidence. Results for melatonin, the most frequently examined pharmacological intervention, were inconclusive, but lower doses may be more effective. Other pharmacological interventions (such as trazadone and orexin-receptor antagonists) demonstrated effectiveness in a small number of trials but require further evidence. Overall, there is insufficient evidence upon which to base clinical decisions regarding the treatment of sleep disturbance in this population. Existing research is marked by wide heterogeneity, which limits opportunities for data synthesis.

40566372,Understanding the Parental Caregiving of Children with Cerebral Palsy in Saudi Arabia: Discovering the Untold Story.,"Parents provide most of the support needed for children with cerebral palsy (CP) to increase the child's participation and independence. Understanding the experiences of parents caring for children with CP is essential for developing effective family programs and services. The current knowledge about parents' experiences in CP is based on studies in Western countries, with little known about this phenomenon in Arab countries like Saudi Arabia. This study aimed to understand the unique experiences and support needs of Saudi parents caring for children with CP from a social-ecological perspective. We conducted a qualitative, exploratory, descriptive study involving 12 semi-structured interviews with mothers and fathers of children with different types of CP. We analyzed the data using a reflexive thematic approach, following six distinct phases. Participants' narratives revealed a complex caregiving journey marked by both challenges and rewards. Support from Saudi nuclear and extended family members was considered important; however, many parents expressed a need for additional physical and financial assistance from their families. Parents reported feeling stressed and experiencing challenges in accessing and navigating educational and healthcare services. Our findings highlight that Islamic values play a crucial role in the experiences of Saudi parents. These values foster a sense of collectivism, highlighting the importance of family support and community involvement, which can affect the Saudi caregiving environment. Parents remain an essential yet often invisible part of the Saudi caregiving system. Without adequate support, parents are at risk of experiencing social, financial, academic, physical, and mental health challenges, which may affect their overall family well-being.

We analyzed 7.5 years of hospital inpatient data obtained from the state of Texas. The OIS subjects (<i>n</i> = 177) were civilians who were shot during a legal intervention involving law enforcement. The control group (<i>n</i> = 33,539) included persons who were hospitalized due to injuries from a car accident. Logistic regression models were used to identify the predictors of an OIS incident. The data included information on chronic diseases, vulnerable population status, health insurance, mental health diagnoses, substance use disorders, and recent trauma. About one-fourth (24.3%) of OIS subjects had a diagnosed mental illness, compared to 8.4% of control subjects (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Factors that greatly increased the risk for an OIS included the following: schizophrenia (AOR = 2.7; CI: 1.6, 4.6), methamphetamine use disorder (AOR = 3.5; CI: 2.2, 5.5), and recent family bereavement (AOR = 8.5; CI: 1.8, 39.6).

However, routine clinical adoption is not spontaneous. Implementation science facilitates stakeholder engagement and the assessment of needs and plans. The study aims to assess the needs related to audiology and speech-language pathology services for children under six years of age and readiness for a tele-practice-based model of care for diagnostic and rehabilitation services among parents within the public sector in Tamil Nadu. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study design was used. The qualitative methods of focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews were conducted for parents of children with disabilities. A quantitative community survey was conducted on parents of children with no known disabilities. A deductive-inductive method of analysis was used. <b>Results:</b> Community survey responses were analyzed using percentage analysis. The results were classified based on the constructs of Bowen's feasibility framework: demand/need for tele-practice, acceptability of tele-practice, and integration and practicality of tele-practice. Parents considered the existing services to be inadequate. Parents perceived tele-practice as beneficial, yet they felt a hybrid method would be more suitable, with sufficiently interspersed in-person visits.

40566359,Trends in Malignant and Benign Brain Tumor Incidence and Mobile Phone Use in the U.S. (2000-2021): A SEER-Based Study.,"(1) Background: There has been an ongoing concern for several decades that radiofrequencies emitted from mobile phones are related to brain cancer risk. We calculated temporal trends in brain cancer incidence rates in adults and children and compared them to mobile phone subscription data over the same time period. (2) Methods: We analyzed the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER 22) cancer database between 2000 and 2021. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) per 100,000 people were calculated and the annual percentage change (APC) for malignant and benign brain cancer and vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuromas of the 8th cranial nerve) was established. The total number of mobile phone subscriptions in the United States was plotted for the period 1985-2024. (3) Results: The APC for adolescents and adults was -0.6 (<i>p</i> = 0.0004) for malignant tumors, -0.06 (<i>p</i> = 0.551) for temporal lobe tumors, and 1.9 (<i>p</i> = 0.00003) for benign tumors.

40566358,Internalizing and Externalizing Behaviors: A Cross-Cultural Study in Colombian and Mexican Adolescents with Eating Disorders.,"In Colombia and Mexico, an increase in emotional, behavioral, and eating problems in adolescents has been documented after the pandemic. The objective was to characterize the relationship between internalizing and externalizing behaviors in adolescents with eating disorders in Colombia and Mexico according to the adolescents' self-report and the parents' report. In Colombia, 17 adolescents between 12 and 18 years old (<i>M</i> = 15.4; <i>SD</i> = 1.8) and one of their parents (<i>n</i> = 17); in Mexico, 8 adolescents between 12 and 17 years old (<i>M</i> = 14.6; <i>SD</i> = 1.6) and one of their parents (<i>n</i> = 8) were evaluated. The parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and the adolescents completed the self-report (YSR) and the EAT-26. The analyses showed a statistically significant correlation between eating problems and anxiety/depression of the YSR (<i>r</i> = 0.39; <i>p</i> = 0.031). Statistically significant differences (<i>p</i> < 0.05) were found in the CBCL scores for externalizing problems, somatic complaints, and rule-breaking behavior; all scores were higher in the Colombian sample.

40566354,Behavioral Consequences Among Survivors of Cerebral Malaria and Acceptability to Different Disciplinary Methods.,"Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening disease that affects mainly children in sub-Saharan Africa. Studies have shown that children who survive CM are often left with neurological disabilities after recovery, such as behavioral changes similar to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). However, diagnosis and treatments for ADHD are limited in many places in Africa. The purpose of this study was to assess behavioral changes following CM infection in Children in Malawi and parents' acceptability of behavioral treatments. Twenty-one parents of children who had survived CM were compared to forty parents from the general population. Assessment instruments included the Disruptive Behavior Rating Scale (DBRS), Treatment Evaluation Inventory-Short Form (TEI-SF), and ADHD symptom checklist. The results showed that the most acceptable treatments among parents in Malawi were interrupt/redirect, discussion, and medication. Parents of CM-surviving children were significantly more accepting of medication (<i>F</i>(1,59) = 7.92, <i>p</i> < 0.007).

40566349,Work-Related Triggers of Mental Illness Relapse in South African Teachers.,"Teachers with mental illness are vulnerable to work-related triggers that can lead to relapse, affecting their mental health and ability to recover, stay employed, and deliver quality education. This empirical study explored such triggers among public school teachers in Limpopo Province, South Africa. Using Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory, a qualitative phenomenological design was adopted. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with 14 participants that were purposively selected across four hospitals. Data were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using Tesch's eight-step open-coding method. Findings revealed being gossiped about by colleagues, excessive workload, limited leadership and parental support, classroom management challenges, high performance expectations without support, and inadequate teacher mental health policies in schools. These triggers can lead to frequent absenteeism and poor teaching outcomes. They will further increase the risk of medication resistance and long-term cognitive decline due to progressive structural brain damage as a result of multiple relapses. The study highlights the urgent need for multi-stakeholder collaboration, including clinicians, academic institutions, union representatives, and the Department of Basic Education, to co-develop effective, context-sensitive strategies to mitigate work-related triggers of mental illness relapse. These strategies are not only essential for enabling long-term workforce participation but also advancing sustainable mental health and well-being.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025.0,Thembi Nkomo; Mokoko Percy Kekana; Mabitsela Hezekiel Mphasha,teacher mental illness vulnerable work relate trigger lead relapse affect mental health ability recover stay employed deliver quality education empirical study explore trigger public school teacher limpopo province south africa bronfenbrenner ecological systems theory qualitative phenomenological design adopt semi structured face face interview conduct 14 participant purposively select hospital datum audio record transcribed verbatim analyze tesch step open code method finding reveal gossip colleague excessive workload limited leadership parental support classroom management challenge high performance expectation support inadequate teacher mental health policy school trigger lead frequent absenteeism poor teaching outcome increase risk medication resistance long term cognitive decline progressive structural brain damage result multiple relapse study highlight urgent need multi stakeholder collaboration include clinician academic institution union representative department basic education co develop effective context sensitive strategy mitigate work relate trigger mental illness relapse strategy essential enable long term workforce participation advance sustainable mental health
40566339,Exploring the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Student Mental Health: A Repeated Cross-Sectional Study.,"<b>Background</b>: Although mental health among students has become a pressing public concern over recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic introduced new stressors, which may further increase the mental health burden for them. While past work has investigated links between pandemic related factors and student mental health and wellbeing, there is conflicting evidence around some symptoms (e.g., anxiety) and little work has focused on less common mental health conditions (e.g., eating disorders). <b>Aims</b>: The current study aimed to detail the prevalence of mental distress in the student population at an early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic and compare university students' mental health before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we aimed to compare levels of depression, anxiety, and eating disorders in a large sample of students. <b>Methods</b>: We analysed data from a repeated cross-sectional survey on different samples of UK university students before the pandemic (<i>n</i> = 4812) and during the pandemic (<i>n</i> = 3817). <b>Results</b>: There were high levels of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 50% experiencing levels above the clinical cut-offs. Findings revealed a significant increase in symptoms of depression and anxiety from pre- to mid-pandemic as well as a significant increase in the prevalence of eating disorders. <b>Conclusions</b>: By late 2020, mental health in the student population had deteriorated compared to pre-pandemic levels. These findings provide evidence for increased levels of depression, anxiety, and eating disorders related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

40566337,Family Support Experiences of Adult Persons with Intellectual Disability and Challenging Behaviour: A Scoping Review of Qualitative Studies.,"There has been scant research on the experiences of families caring for adults with intellectual disability who use challenging behaviour as a way of making their needs known. The aim of this scoping review was to synthesize the qualitative research data on the family support experiences of adult family members with intellectual disability who use challenging behaviour in this way. A systematic search was undertaken from five databases during December 2024 and updated in April 2025. A total of 20 studies were included in the review. Data were analysed using a thematic analysis method. The number of study participants in these studies ranged from 4 to 30. Most of them were parents and predominantly mothers. The results show that caring for adults with intellectual disability and challenging behaviour reflects a dual reality. The negative experiences refer to caregiving difficulties and inadequate formal support, while the positive experiences are associated with support from informal sources and caregivers' fulfilment and gains. The available research did not offer sufficient data for a synthesis of how families might be affected by challenging behaviour. Future research should investigate how the negative and positive aspects of their families can be shaped to make a positive impact on caring for people with intellectual disability and co-existing challenging behaviour.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025.0,Alice Nga Lai Kwong; Lisa Pau Le Low; Maggie Yat Cheung Wong,scant research experience family care adult intellectual disability use challenge behaviour way make need know aim scoping review synthesize qualitative research datum family support experience adult family member intellectual disability use challenge behaviour way systematic search undertake database december 2024 update april 2025 total 20 study include review datum analyse thematic analysis method number study participant study range 4 30 parent predominantly mother result care adult intellectual disability challenge behaviour reflect dual reality negative experience refer caregive difficulty inadequate formal support positive experience associate support informal source caregiver fulfilment gain available research offer sufficient datum synthesis family affect challenge behaviour future research investigate negative positive aspect family shape positive impact care people intellectual disability co exist challenging behaviour
40566334,The Longitudinal Relationship Between Physical Functions and Cognitive Functions Among Middle-Aged and Older Adults in Primary Care.,"(1) Background: Gait speed (GS) and handgrip strength (HGS) have been identified as factors in cognitive impairment, depression, sleep problems, and quality of life. This study aims to comprehensively investigate the longitudinal relationship between physical functions (gait speed and handgrip strength) and cognitive functions, as well as cognitive decline, in middle-aged and older adults in China. (2) Methods: Using longitudinal data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), we analyzed 1903 subjects aged 60 and above with repeated measurements of GS, and 4218 subjects aged 45 and above with repeated measurements of HGS. The cognitive functions we considered included drawing ability, word recall, TICS-10, and an overall cognitive score (OCS). Mixed-effect logistic and linear regression were used to analyze the association between GS/HGS and cognitive functions in middle-aged and older adults with repeated measurements. (3) Results: A faster GS is associated with better drawing ability (OR = 1.33, <i>p</i> = 0.045) and TICS-10 (OR = 1.60, <i>p</i> = 0.024). A stronger HGS is associated with higher odds of drawing ability (OR = 1.36, <i>p</i> = 0.012) and better TICS-10 (OR = 1.41, <i>p</i> = 0.018). Both weak HGS and slow GS are significantly associated with a higher decline in cognitive function, while HGS is more predictive of the decline for women and GS is more predictive for men. (4) Conclusions: Both GS and HG are positively associated with cognitive functions cross-sectionally and longitudinally in middle-aged and older adults. Health interventions targeting HGS and GS may help improve cognitive functions. Future research is warranted to establish the causal relationship between these interventions and improvements in cognitive functions.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025.0,Nan Hu; Wupeng Yin; Rabeya Illyas Noon; Noof Alabdullatif,1 background gait speed gs handgrip strength hgs identify factor cognitive impairment depression sleep problem quality life study aim comprehensively investigate longitudinal relationship physical function gait speed handgrip strength cognitive function cognitive decline middle aged old adult china 2 method longitudinal datum china health retirement longitudinal study charls analyze 1903 subject age 60 repeat measurement gs 4218 subject age 45 repeat measurement hgs cognitive function consider include drawing ability word recall tics-10 overall cognitive score ocs mixed effect logistic linear regression analyze association gs hgs cognitive function middle aged old adult repeat measurement 3 result fast gs associate well drawing ability = 1.33 < > p</i > = 0.045 tics-10 = 1.60 < > p</i > = 0.024 strong hgs associate high odd draw ability = 1.36 < > p</i > = 0.012 well tics-10 = 1.41 < > p</i > = 0.018 weak hgs slow gs significantly associate high decline cognitive function hgs predictive decline woman gs predictive man 4 conclusion gs hg positively associate cognitive function cros sectionally longitudinally middle aged old adult health intervention target hgs gs help improve cognitive function future research warrant establish causal relationship intervention improvement cognitive function

Therefore, this study was conducted to identify some factors related to post-traumatic sequelae in people in a mountainous province in Northern Vietnam. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 228 residents from two communes (Pom Lot and Thanh Minh) in Dien Bien province. The participants had all experienced an injury from any cause within the year preceding the study. The post-traumatic sequelae and potential associated factors were assessed. The rate of post-traumatic sequelae among the study participants was 62.3%. An older age (>40), belonging to an ethnic minority group, a short treatment duration, and a lack of family and social support were factors associated with an increased risk of post-traumatic sequelae. Post-traumatic stress disorder is a significant health burden for people in the mountainous regions of Northern Vietnam. This study identified vulnerable groups, particularly the elderly, ethnic minorities, and those with inadequate treatment or social support.

40566328,Enriched Motor Program [EMP]: Adaptation of a Physical Activity Intervention for Enhancing Executive Functions in Children with ASD.,"Recent studies indicate that physical activity (PA) may improve executive functions (EFs) in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The Enriched Motor Program (EMP), which combines aerobic and cognitive exercises, shows potential for enhancing EFs in these children. The EMP was originally created for typically developing preschoolers and includes locomotor and fine motor activities enriched by cognitive stimuli to help the development of EFs in children with ASD. The current study aims to adapt a shorter version of EMP for these children's needs. The research will use a cross-sectional, quasi-experimental design with a forecasted sample of 40 children, with the age ranging from six to eight, with a diagnosis of ASD. The children's working memory and inhibitory control will be measured before and after the intervention. According to the literature, the experimental group should obtain higher scores, especially in working memory tasks. This is the first implementation of EMP, which merges physical activities with cognitive stimuli to enhance EFs in children with ASD. It could be used by specialized centers and clinicians to support EFs through engaging activities, and it could be potentially recommended as a best practice for EF treatments in children with ASD.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025.0,Gabriele Gullo; Ambra Gentile; Marianna Alesi,recent study indicate physical activity pa improve executive function efs child autism spectrum disorder asd enriched motor program emp combine aerobic cognitive exercise show potential enhance ef child emp originally create typically develop preschooler include locomotor fine motor activity enrich cognitive stimulus help development efs child asd current study aim adapt short version emp child need research use cross sectional quasi experimental design forecasted sample 40 child age range diagnosis asd child work memory inhibitory control measure intervention accord literature experimental group obtain high score especially work memory task implementation emp merge physical activity cognitive stimulus enhance ef child asd specialized center clinician support ef engage activity potentially recommend good practice ef treatment child asd
40566321,Partnering with Family Organizations in Research: Experiences from the Field.,"Parent Peer Support (PPS) provided by other caregivers who have lived experience raising a child with mental health conditions (e.g., such as anxiety, depression, attention, and/or behavior disorders) holds promise as a service that can improve outcomes by helping young people and their families overcome system- and individual-level barriers to receiving care. Here, we describe the development of a collaboration of researchers and Family-Run Organizations (FROs) to provide research support for PPS through three phases (1) developing a research agenda and study aims through a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) ""Pipeline to Proposal"" grant; (2) designing a pilot study, including refining the measurement framework for a successful grant application to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); and (3) implementing the study through the incorporation of research methodology into FRO operations without disrupting the organizations' missions. This paper summarizes the participatory action research (PAR) strategies employed by this interdisciplinary research team throughout the three phases, covering the benefits and challenges of these unique partnership activities.

However, they often face barriers to inclusion in school-based sports, especially in under-resourced areas. This study aimed to (1) assess the level of participation in school sports among learners with IDs, and (2) explore teachers' perceptions of the benefits and barriers to such participation in special schools within the Vhembe District of South Africa. A qualitative, descriptive research design was employed. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 teachers from four special schools. Thematic analysis helped identify key themes and interpret responses. All schools offered weekly sports activities, as required by the Department of Education. Teachers viewed sports as vital for social interaction, physical fitness, and psychological well-being. However, barriers such as insufficient adapted equipment, inadequate facilities, and limited family support hindered meaningful participation, particularly for learners with profound disabilities. School sports have the potential to transform the lives of learners with IDs, but systemic barriers restrict access.

However, there is limited epidemiological evidence from rural regions of Ecuador, where working and living conditions may differ substantially from those in other settings. This study aimed to identify predictors of LBP among farmers in rural Ecuador to inform locally relevant prevention strategies. Participants aged 30 to 60 years (<i>n</i> = 103) were recruited through a traveling health clinic. Participants were assessed with behavioral and sociodemographic self-report questionnaires and anthropometric measurements. Low back pain (LBP) was assessed using the Standardized Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire, which asked about symptoms experienced in the past 12 months. Bivariate (Chi-square and Fisher exact tests) and multivariate (binary logistic regression) analyses were conducted to explore associations between risk factors and LBP in individuals aged 30 to 60 years. LBP was highly prevalent, affecting 78.6% of participants. Behavioral patterns were mixed, with low rates of smoking and moderate alcohol and coffee consumption associated with LBP. A normal body mass index (BMI) was observed in 66% of the sample, and over half reported stable mood and good self-perceived health. In the binary logistic regression analysis, only education level significantly predicted LBP, with secondary education acting as a protective factor.

40566305,Bullying in Students with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): Analyzing Students' Social Status and Student-Teacher Relationship Quality.,"The present study investigated how the quality of teacher-student relationships and students' social status among peers relate to bullying experiences in children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and those with typical development (TD). A sample of 135 students (27 with ADHD and 108 with TD; <i>M</i> = 11.37, <i>SD</i> = 1.25) participated. Using a structural equation model, we examined whether ADHD predicted students' relationships with teachers and peers and whether these variables, in turn, predicted bullying victimization and perpetration. The model showed a good fit. Children with ADHD reported more conflictual relationships with teachers, lower peer preference, and higher social impact compared to their typically developing peers. These relationship characteristics were differentially associated with bullying outcomes, with teacher-student conflict and peer visibility emerging as social risk factors. Although preliminary, the results suggest that the relational context-particularly teacher attention and peer dynamics-may play a critical role in shaping the social experiences of students with ADHD and could have unintended consequences within peer groups.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025.0,Sofia Mastrokoukou; Martina Berchiatti; Laura Badenes-Ribera; Laura Galiana; Claudio Longobardi,present study investigate quality teacher student relationship student social status peer relate bully experience child attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd typical development td sample 135 student 27 adhd 108 td < > m</i > = 11.37 < > sd</i > = 1.25 participate structural equation model examine adhd predict student relationship teacher peer variable turn predict bully victimization perpetration model show good fit child adhd report conflictual relationship teacher low peer preference high social impact compare typically develop peer relationship characteristic differentially associate bully outcome teacher student conflict peer visibility emerge social risk factor preliminary result suggest relational context particularly teacher attention peer dynamic play critical role shape social experience student adhd unintended consequence peer group

40566287,Dementia Education and Training for In-Patient Health Care Support Workers in Acute Care Contexts: A Mixed-Methods Pilot Evaluation.,"To understand dementia care knowledge, attitudes, and confidence among acute-care support staff following a dementia education intervention titled Dementia Workforce Excellence in Acute Care. A convergent parallel mixed-methods pilot study. Data were collected from 30 participants using an online survey and three individual interviews between January and March 2024. Survey data were analysed using descriptive statistics, and a thematic analysis underpinned by Kirkpatrick's framework was used to analyse the qualitative data from interviews. The online survey established good levels of dementia knowledge, attitudes, and confidence among support staff with enhanced attitudes among staff who completed the training. Analysis of interviews resulted in three themes: dementia in the acute care setting; motivation for learning; and evaluation of the intervention on four levels [satisfaction, learning gains, behaviours, and results]. Findings suggest that the dementia education intervention used in this study is a comprehensive dementia training resource that promotes person-centred and compassionate dementia care across all stages of the dementia journey. Dementia is a public health priority with workforce education identified as a key response for capacity building. This pilot evaluation offers insight and new learning on the pedagogical approaches that are inclusive of peer-supported reflective learning in small groups that remain untapped for dementia workforce development. Dementia inclusive and enabling environments with a knowledgeable and skilled workforce are crucial to mitigate stigma and discrimination. This can be best achieved by raising awareness through targeted staff education and training to make hospital environments more dementia inclusive.

This study outlines the protocol for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the efficacy of RESPONSIBLEPLAY<sup>©</sup>, a Multi-theory Model (MTM)-based intervention designed to promote responsible gambling behaviors. Proposed Methods: The intervention integrates six MTM constructs-participatory dialogue, behavioral confidence, changes in the physical environment, emotional transformation, practice for change, and changes in the social environment-to address the initiation and sustenance of behavior change. College students aged 21 and older, scoring 3 or higher on the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI), will be randomly assigned to either the MTM-based intervention group or a traditional knowledge-based intervention group. The participants will complete surveys assessing PGSI and MTM constructs at pre-test, post-test, and eight-week follow-up. This study aims to provide evidence for the efficacy of theory-driven intervention compared to a knowledge-based approach. If successful, this protocol will establish a robust framework for mitigating gambling-related harm in vulnerable college populations, paving the way for scalable, evidence-based interventions in diverse settings. The findings will contribute to the development of public health strategies that integrate theoretical constructs with practical applications to address high-risk behaviors.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025.0,Sidath Kapukotuwa; Kavita Batra; Christopher Johansen; Manoj Sharma,gambling behavior college student grow public health concern problem gambling rate significantly higher population general public study outline protocol randomize control trial rct evaluate efficacy responsibleplay < sup> © </sup > multi theory model mtm)-based intervention design promote responsible gambling behavior propose method intervention integrate mtm construct participatory dialogue behavioral confidence change physical environment emotional transformation practice change change social environment address initiation sustenance behavior change college student age 21 old score 3 high problem gambling severity index pgsi randomly assign mtm base intervention group traditional knowledge base intervention group participant complete survey assess pgsi mtm construct pre test post test week follow study aim provide evidence efficacy theory drive intervention compare knowledge base approach successful protocol establish robust framework mitigate gambling relate harm vulnerable college population pave way scalable evidence base intervention diverse setting finding contribute development public health strategy integrate theoretical construct practical application address high risk behavior
40566282,Longitudinal Associations Between Sources of Uncertainty and Mental Health Amongst Resettled Refugees During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"The COVID-19 pandemic may have disproportionately affected forcibly displaced people due to parallel uncertainties such as visa insecurity and family separation. This study explicitly examined whether different sources of uncertainty contributed in specific ways to increased psychological symptoms for refugees during the pandemic. A large cohort of 733 refugees and asylum seekers settled in Australia completed a mental health survey in June 2020 (T1) and 12 months later in June 2021 (T2). Using cross-lagged panel modelling, we tested changes in post-traumatic stress (PTS), depression and anxiety symptoms, visa status, family separation and COVID-19 uncertainty stress, and the contribution of intolerance of uncertainty (trait prospective and inhibitory), controlling for age, sex, trauma exposure, language, and time in Australia. Visa status and family separation stress at T1 predicted increased depression (bidirectional pathways) and PTS symptoms at T2 (unidirectional pathways), respectively. Visa status uncertainty at T1 was also associated with increases in COVID-19 and family separation stress at T2. Intolerance of uncertainty showed limited associations with symptoms and stressors. Findings demonstrate that different forms of refugee uncertainty had specific impacts on psychopathology during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.

40566276,Systematic Intervention with Formal Caregivers to Promote Nutritional Health of Older People with Dementia: An Impact Evaluation Study.,"Nutritional health is essential for older people with dementia. Their feeding is a challenge for which caregivers are not always ready, and an intervention that supports them may have a significant social impact. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate the impact of systematic nursing intervention with formal caregivers to promote nutritional health for older people with dementia. This is a ""Nursing Methodology Research"" study conducted with formal caregivers of older people with dementia in four Colombian nursing homes. It includes three consecutive phases: (1) systematic intervention design under Whittemore and Grey's parameters, (2) intervention validation with seven international experts, and (3) measurement of intervention impact, which included a quasi-experimental pre-test-post-test design. The ""Nurturing Neurons-Formal Caregivers"" intervention met the criteria of systematic health interventions. In response to the work and personal requirements of formal caregivers, the intervention used a tele-support modality. Its content validity ratio (CVR) ranged from 0.88 to 0.92; its content validity index (CVI) was 0.90. The experience was positive for the participant caregivers (94.9%) and professional providers (92.5%). The overall caregivers' caring competence changed from the medium, 78.1, to the high category, 91.5 (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Their perceived burden of care changed from 70.4 to 63.6 (<i>p</i> < 0.001). In conclusion, ""Nurturing Neurons-Formal Caregivers"" achieved a positive impact, with changes in the structure, processes, and outputs to promote the nutritional health of older people with dementia. It led to a significant improvement in formal caregivers' caring competence and decreased their perceived care burden. Its cost-benefit was favorable; it generated health equity for a vulnerable population and achieved unexpected benefits in the context.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025.0,Paola Sarmiento-González; María Elisa Moreno-Fergusson; Alejandra Rojas-Rivera; Juan Alcides Cuadros-Mojica; Bibiana Ramírez-Pulido; Beatriz Sánchez-Herrera,nutritional health essential old people dementia feeding challenge caregiver ready intervention support significant social impact aim project design evaluate impact systematic nursing intervention formal caregiver promote nutritional health old people dementia nursing methodology research study conduct formal caregiver old people dementia colombian nursing home include consecutive phase 1 systematic intervention design whittemore grey parameter 2 intervention validation seven international expert 3 measurement intervention impact include quasi experimental pre test post test design nurture neurons formal caregivers intervention meet criterion systematic health intervention response work personal requirement formal caregiver intervention tele support modality content validity ratio cvr range 0.88 0.92 content validity index cvi 0.90 experience positive participant caregiver 94.9 professional provider 92.5 overall caregiver care competence change medium 78.1 high category 91.5 < > p</i > < 0.001 perceive burden care change 70.4 63.6 < > p</i > < 0.001 conclusion nurture neurons formal caregivers achieve positive impact change structure process output promote nutritional health old people dementia lead significant improvement formal caregiver caring competence decrease perceive care burden cost benefit favorable generate health equity vulnerable population achieve unexpected benefit context
40566271,DSM-5 Criteria for Alcohol and Cannabis Use Disorders: Are Older Adults Less Likely to Endorse Certain Criteria?,"With increasing substance misuse among older adults, we examined the question of whether older adults may be less likely to endorse certain DSM-5 criteria for alcohol and cannabis use disorders (AUD and CUD). We used the 2021-2023 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (<i>N</i> = 17,494 for AUD and <i>N</i> = 12,264 for CUD) and descriptive statistics to compare the 65+ and under 65 age groups in their endorsements of 11 DSM-5 criteria. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted for each criterion as the dependent variable with the age group as the independent variable and other characteristics as covariates. For AUD, the 65+ age group was associated with lower odds of endorsing seven out of eleven DSM-5 criteria, including social impairments (e.g., failure to fulfill role obligations (aOR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.16-0.56); social problems (aOR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.30-0.71); given-up activities (aOR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.47-0.94); hazardous use (aOR = 0.53, 95% Yes CI = 0.34-0.81); and physical/psychological problems (aOR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.37-0.70). For CUD, the 65+ age group was less likely than the under 65 age group to endorse hazardous use (aOR = 0.04, 95% CI = 0.01-0.17) and withdrawal (aOR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.20-0.73 for criterion A and aOR = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.05-0.48 for criterion B).

40566256,Frequent Users in Psychiatric Consultations: A 6-Year Retrospective Study in the Emergency Department.,"The increasing prevalence of emergency room (ER) visits for mental health concerns presents a significant challenge for healthcare systems. This study aimed to analyze the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics associated with frequent users of psychiatric consultations in the ER of Maggiore della Carità University Hospital in Novara, Italy. A retrospective observational study was conducted over a six-year period (2017-2022), including all psychiatric consultations recorded in a hospital database. Frequent users were defined as individuals undergoing at least three psychiatric consultations in the ER within a year. Univariable and multivariable logistic models were employed to identify significant socio-demographic and clinical predictors of frequent use. Of the 1565 individuals who received psychiatric consultations in the ER, 92 (5.88%) were identified as frequent users. Factors associated with higher ER utilization included being unmarried (aOR 1.35, 95% CI 1.02-1.79), younger age (aOR 1.32, 95% CI 1.02-1.72), homelessness, diagnosis of schizophrenia, substance use disorder (aOR 1.49, 95% CI 1.06-2.09), and ongoing psychopharmacological treatment (aOR 1.56, 95% CI 1.12-2.18).

40566251,Influence of Socio-Ecological and Economic Correlates on Marijuana Legalization Policy Across the States of America.,"Marijuana legalization has been at the center of debate in the social and political realm of the United States. So far, thirty nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana either for recreational or medical purposes. States are taking a cautious approach to legalization in a policy context consisting of multi-layered sociopolitical systems. Strong arguments from advocacy groups supporting and opposing legalization highlight the significance of assessing the impact of marijuana use and its legalization on the well-being of the community and its members. Utilizing the social determinants of health and system perspectives, this study measures the cumulative effect of six socio-ecological and economic predictors, such as the state's marijuana use prevalence and median household income, on the dependent variable of marijuana legality scores using discriminant analysis and One-way ANOVA. As hypothesized, the result shows a significant influence of the predictors on the state policy score of marijuana legality. Predicted associations between independent and dependent variables were also found. Findings suggest that without a supportive policy context comprising social, economic, and political factors, marijuana legalization might not have the desired impact on the community.

40566244,Health Knowledge About Early Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Case for Soft Transdiagnostic Approaches to Better Represent the Clinical and Scientific Reality of ASD.,"This study explores the current state of science regarding DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in young children. It examines the effectiveness of existing diagnostic methods and evaluates the potential of transdiagnostic approaches for early intervention. A systematic literature review was conducted using MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, focusing on peer-reviewed studies published between 2020 and 2023. The search followed PRISMA guidelines, selecting articles investigating ASD diagnosis in toddlers and preschoolers using DSM-5 criteria, behavioral assessments, and emerging diagnostic tools. Findings indicate that DSM-5 provides a structured framework for ASD diagnosis, but it has limitations in early identification. It is necessary to integrate multiple assessment tools. Recent research highlights transdiagnostic models, which move beyond rigid diagnostic categories to capture the complexities of ASD presentation in young children. The literature supports a shift towards a transdiagnostic approach that combines behavioral, biological, and environmental assessments. This study underscores the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to refine ASD diagnostic frameworks to ensure more accurate and timely diagnoses that better serve affected children and their families.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025.0,Mirah Dow; Ting Wang,study explore current state science dsm-5 diagnostic criterion autism spectrum disorder asd young child examine effectiveness exist diagnostic method evaluate potential transdiagnostic approach early intervention systematic literature review conduct medline psycinfo psychology behavioral sciences collection focus peer review study publish 2020 2023 search follow prisma guideline select article investigate asd diagnosis toddler preschooler dsm-5 criterion behavioral assessment emerge diagnostic tool finding indicate dsm-5 provide structured framework asd diagnosis limitation early identification necessary integrate multiple assessment tool recent research highlight transdiagnostic model rigid diagnostic category capture complexity asd presentation young child literature support shift transdiagnostic approach combine behavioral biological environmental assessment study underscore need interdisciplinary collaboration refine asd diagnostic framework ensure accurate timely diagnosis well serve affected child family

40566242,The Roles of Dissociation and Depression in PTSD Among Soldiers Exposed to Combat.,"Exposure to severe combat situations significantly raises the risk of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Trauma survivors may use dissociation as a defense mechanism, increasing the likelihood of PTSD. This study aims to explore the roles of dissociation and depression in PTSD among soldiers exposed to combat who sought help from the Israel Combat Stress Reaction Unit. <b>Method:</b> This cross-sectional study involved 927 individuals who participated in a particular military operation in 2014 [98.5% male (<i>n</i> = 906); mean age = 27.08 (SD = 5.93)]. Participants completed three questionnaires: the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Post-Traumatic Stress Symptom Checklist (PCL-5) for PTSD. <b>Results:</b> Our results showed that severe PTSD (PCL score ≥ 33) was found in 30.4% of participants, and 76.6% showed dissociative symptoms (DES score ≥ 30). Additionally, 23.5% experienced moderate depression, while 19.1% reported severe depressive symptoms. A Generalized Linear Model revealed that both depression and dissociation significantly contribute to PTSD. Individuals with depression were three times more likely to experience post-traumatic symptoms compared to 1.23 times for those with dissociative symptoms. <b>Conclusions:</b> Life-threatening situations significantly predicted higher PTSD symptoms, serving as a risk factor for depression and dissociation, which play important roles in PTSD, with depression having notably greater impact.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025.0,Leah Shelef; Nir Spira; Uzi Bechor; Jacob Rotschield; Eran Shadach,exposure severe combat situation significantly raise risk depression post traumatic stress disorder ptsd trauma survivor use dissociation defense mechanism increase likelihood ptsd study aim explore role dissociation depression ptsd soldier expose combat seek help israel combat stress reaction unit < b > method:</b > cross sectional study involve 927 individual participate particular military operation 2014 98.5 male < > n</i > = 906 mean age = 27.08 sd = 5.93 participant complete questionnaire dissociative experiences scale des beck depression inventory bdi post traumatic stress symptom checklist pcl-5 ptsd < b > results:</b > result show severe ptsd pcl score ≥ 33 find 30.4 participant 76.6 show dissociative symptom des score ≥ 30 additionally 23.5 experience moderate depression 19.1 report severe depressive symptom generalized linear model reveal depression dissociation significantly contribute ptsd individual depression time likely experience post traumatic symptom compare 1.23 time dissociative symptom < b > conclusions:</b > life threaten situation significantly predict high ptsd symptom serve risk factor depression dissociation play important role ptsd depression have notably great impact
40566132,Visualization of the Glymphatic System Through Brain Magnetic Resonance in Human Subjects with Neurodegenerative Disorders: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"<b>Background:</b> One of the major contributors to homeostasis at the level of the central nervous system, specifically the brain, is the glymphatic system, which is described as an exchange occurring at the level of and between the interstitial fluid and cerebrospinal fluid that has been linked to neurodegenerative processes. <b>Methods</b>: Fourteen studies were included after PROSPERO registration and a literature search. Screening, reviewing, and data extraction were performed by two reviewers. Quality assessment scales were used. General continuous and subgroup analysis, heterogeneity tests, and random effect models were run using SPSS. Forest plots were constructed based on subgroup analysis. <b>Results</b>: Significant correlations (<i>p</i> < 0.05) were detected between MRI indices and outcomes quantifying neurodegenerative diseases. Studies on Alzheimer's disease showed a positive correlation between diffusivity indices and cognitive scores. Studies on Parkinson's disease showed negative correlations between diffusivity indices and disease severity, progression, and motor function (<i>p</i> < 0.05). As for other conditions, the conclusions remain uncertain, yet positive results were detected (<i>p</i> < 0.05). <b>Conclusions</b>: Positive significant correlations were deduced between the ALPS index and cognitive scores, indicating that low cognition is correlated with a low ALPS index and enlarged PVSs. Negative significant correlations were deduced between ALPS indices and UPDRS scores, indicating motor dysfunction is correlated with lower ALPS indices and enlarged PVSs. Finally, MRI parameters may help to deduce disease progression across subgroups.

40566110,The Mental Health of Children with Cerebral Palsy: A Review of the Last Five Years of Research.,"Children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP) often experience associated functional limitations, diseases, or impairments. Included in these associated concerns are mental health symptoms/disorders and academic concerns. There has been an increasing research focus on the mental health of youth with CP over the past 5 years, and there is a need to synthesize this research. This review aims to synthesize the most recent research on the mental and behavioral health of youth with CP. A literature search on research focused on mental health, academic functioning, and mental and behavioral treatment for youth with CP was conducted in August of 2024 and limited to the last 5 years to highlight the most recent developments in this area of research. Four hundred and forty-eight articles were screened, and thirty-eight articles were included in this review. Based on this literature review, children with CP have high rates of mental health diagnoses across multiple diagnostic areas, including autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, intellectual developmental disorder, anxiety, and depression. Academic concerns are common for children with CP. Intervention studies have focused on both child and parent interventions.

Furthermore, we aimed to investigate whether there is a correlation between the presence of TMDs and the level of MS-related disability. <b>Methods:</b> The study was conducted at two centers in Poland dealing with the treatment of MS between March 2025 and April 2025. The study used an original survey questionnaire, the European Academy of Craniomandibular Diseases (EACD) questionnaire and the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD). The study group included people with multiple sclerosis, while the control group consisted of healthy people without neurological deficits. The study group was examined using the following methods: the McDonald criteria and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). <b>Results:</b> The study involved 90 people (45 in both groups). The majority of the study participants were women (80.0%), aged 20-30 years (51.1%) and people living in small towns (51.1%). The largest number of patients with MS were noted with RRMS (75.5%). The duration of the disease was on average 3.3 ± 2.4, and the EDSS score was on average 2.5 ± 1.5. People from the study group significantly (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05; ES = 0.52-0.86) reported TMDs more frequently based on EACD (pain on opening the mouth: 86.7%; facial pain: 57.8%; joint locking: 28.9%; headaches: 75.3%). The diagnosis of TMDs was confirmed in 40.0% of people with MS and 11.1% of healthy volunteers (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05). Patients most frequently reported muscle pain and disk displacement with reduction (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05). The disability score in the MS group did not exhibit differences in the occurrence of TMDs (<i>p</i> > 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> The study showed that TMDs are more common in people with multiple sclerosis.

40566080,Reported Adverse Events in Patients with CF Receiving Treatment with Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor: 5 Years Observational Study.,"<b>Background:</b> Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) treatment is showing remarkable beneficial effects in people with Cystic Fibrosis (pwCF) harboring the F508del mutation in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (<i>CFTR</i>) gene. Although this therapy is generally well tolerated in pwCF, some adverse events (AEs) have been recently described both in controlled studies and in post-marketing observations. <b>Methods</b>: We followed 414 pwCF carrying F508del <i>CFTR</i> that initiated ETI treatment, recording AEs for a period of 5 years. <b>Results</b>: A total of 142 AEs were reported. The most frequent AEs in the whole cohort were liver marker elevation, skin rush, epigastric pain, headache, and depression. Considering pediatric subjects, psychiatric and gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequent AEs. Only one patient reported a severe AE, leading to treatment discontinuation. In case of AEs, different decisions on ETI treatment were made, including temporary interruption and temporary or permanent dosage modification. <b>Conclusions</b>: Throughout the long-term observational period, almost 21% of pwCF experienced at least one AE. Psychiatric disorders, in particular attention deficit, were the most prevalent issue in our pediatric cohort, whereas adult patients mainly reported depression, anxiety and sleep disorders.

40566073,Light and Food: Body Image Moderates the Effects of Chronotype on the Risk to Develop an Eating Disorder.,"<b>Background:</b> Evening chronotypes are increasingly recognized as being at elevated risk of psychological vulnerabilities, including sleep disturbances, mood disorders, and disordered eating. Body image, a central self-related construct, has been identified as a key factor influencing eating disorder (ED) risk. This study aimed to explore whether body image moderates the relationship between chronotype and the risk of developing an ED. <b>Methods</b>: A total of 165 adults (139 women; mean age = 35.45) completed validated self-report questionnaires assessing chronotype (Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire), body image (Body Shape Questionnaire), and ED risk (EAT-26). Pearson correlations and moderation analyses (PROCESS macro and Model 1) were conducted with body image as a moderator of the association between chronotype and ED risk. <b>Results</b>: Eveningness was significantly associated with greater ED risk (r = -0.53, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and a more negative body image (r = -0.48, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Body image was a strong predictor of ED risk (r = 0.85, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Moderation analysis revealed a significant interaction between chronotype and body image (b = -0.006, SE = 0.0009, <i>p</i> < 0.001), indicating that the relationship between chronotype and ED risk was stronger among individuals with a more negative body image. <b>Conclusions</b>: These findings highlight the role of body image as a moderating factor in the link between chronotype and eating disorder vulnerability. Interventions aimed at improving body image, especially among evening chronotypes, may help mitigate ED risk.

40566026,Depression and Coronary Artery Disease-Where We Stand?,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) and mental health disorders, particularly depression and anxiety, exhibit a complex, bidirectional relationship that adversely influences clinical outcomes and mortality. Mental illnesses account for approximately 8 million deaths annually, while cardiovascular diseases, including CAD, contribute to about 17 million deaths, with CAD alone responsible for one-third of deaths among individuals aged ≥35 years. This review offers a structured synthesis of current knowledge focusing on the (1) epidemiology, emphasizing the reciprocal risk between CAD and psychiatric conditions; (2) pathophysiological insights, including inflammation, neurohormonal dysregulation, platelet hyperactivation, and shared genetic determinants; and (3) therapeutic approaches, encompassing pharmacological management, psychotherapeutic interventions, and integrated care models. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) remain the pharmacologic agents of choice in patients with CAD and depression due to their favorable cardiac profile, while cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) offers psychological benefit.

40566012,Benzodiazepine Misuse Among Health Care Workers: The Effect of Sleep Disorders on Work Performance.,"<b>Background</b>: Benzodiazepines (BZDs), commonly used to treat insomnia and anxiety, are increasingly used in Spain, raising concerns due to their potential for abuse and dependence. This study investigates the use of BZDs and other psychotropic medications among healthcare workers, exploring their prevalence, associated factors, and their relationship with mental health issues following the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods</b>: An anonymous online survey was conducted among healthcare workers at the Salamanca University Healthcare Complex (CAUSA) from March 2023 to January 2024. Of 1121 participants, 685 provided complete responses, which were analysed. Insomnia, anxiety, and depression were assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4). <b>Results</b>: Of the respondents, 23.8% reported using sleep medication, with 27.8% doing so without a prescription. Additionally, 14.7% used medication for depression or anxiety, with only 0.6% without a prescription. Hypnotic medicine use was associated with older age, insomnia, anxiety, depression, psychological or psychiatric treatment, COVID-19 after-effects, and diagnosed sleep disorders. Night-shift work was associated with increased hypnotic medication use in men but not in women. The use of these medications was linked to a reduced quality of life and impaired work performance. <b>Conclusions</b>: The use of BZD and self-medication are prevalent among healthcare professionals, exceeding the rates observed in the general population.

40565914,A Structured Narrative Review of the OSA-T2DM Axis.,"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are two highly prevalent and interconnected conditions with significant implications for morbidity and mortality. Emerging evidence suggests a bidirectional relationship between the two disorders, mediated by shared pathophysiological mechanisms such as intermittent hypoxia, systemic inflammation, and autonomic dysfunction. <b>Methods</b>: A structured narrative review of the literature was conducted using a comprehensive PubMed search of clinical and observational studies published between 2020 and 2024. Studies evaluating the association between OSA and diabetes, including its effects on glycemic control, diabetic complications, and treatment outcomes, were included. <b>Results</b>: Thirty-three studies met our inclusion criteria. OSA is independently associated with impaired glucose metabolism, increased insulin resistance, and a higher risk of diabetic complications, including nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy has shown variable effects on metabolic outcomes, largely dependent on adherence. Traditional OSA severity metrics, such as the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), did not consistently predict metabolic burden. Factors such as sleep quality, nocturnal hypoxemia, and comorbid insomnia have emerged as the most relevant predictors. Sex-specific differences and the roles of pharmacological and behavioral interventions were also noted. <b>Conclusions</b>: OSA is a modifiable and under-recognized risk factor for poor glycemic control and diabetes complications. Routine screening and individualized treatment strategies are warranted, particularly for patients with T2DM and suboptimal metabolic control.

This study aimed to investigate the associations among cognitive impairment, depression, and kidney involvement in elderly patients. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional analysis was conducted among hospitalized patients aged ≥65 years. Standardized tools such as the geriatric depression scale (GDS) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were used to assess depression and cognitive impairment, and kidney function was evaluated using eGFR and albuminuria. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to identify associations. <b>Results:</b> The study population consisted of 719 participants with a median age of 80 years. Kidney and mental health issues were highly prevalent: CKD was identified in 59.4%, cognitive impairment in 74%, and depression in 61.9% of patients. Patients with CKD were older and exhibited lower MoCA scores (<i>p</i> = 0.001), higher GDS scores (<i>p</i> = 0.007), reduced albumin (<i>p</i> < 0.001), lower hemoglobin levels (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and elevated C-reactive protein (<i>p</i> < 0.001).

We also aim to determine factors associated with admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). <b>Methods</b>: A descriptive observational study was carried out based on the Spanish Hospital Discharge Database (SHDD). ICD-10 codes were used to identify ARHAs in T1D patients. Joinpoint regression was used to analyze the time trend, and multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify predictors of ICU admission. <b>Results</b>: We recorded 39,091 discharges with T1D (52.59% females); of these, 1274 (3.26% prevalence) were identified as ARHAs (74.10% males vs. 25.90% females). Joinpoint regression showed a significant increase among females and stable prevalence in males. Females with T1D and ARHAs were younger than males, and more frequently had diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), mental disorders, and external causes of morbidity and mortality, whereas greater drug use was detected among males. Overall, 20.80% of ARHAs required ICU admission. Predictors of ICU admission included DKA, drug use, hypoglycemia, and female sex (OR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.02-1.90). <b>Conclusions</b>: The frequency of ARHAs in young people with T1D in Spain rose between 2016 and 2023, mainly owing to the increase in the percentage of females requiring ARHA.

Investigating Conceptual and Empirical Distinctions in a High-Stress Occupational Group.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Despite 50 years of research, there is still no consensus on whether burnout and depression are distinct constructs within the domain of occupational psychopathology. The overarching aim of this study was to address the question of whether burnout and depression represent manifestations of the same phenomenon, based on data collected from a sample of police officers working in Central Europe. <b>Methods:</b> The participants included a representative group of Polish police officers. They were selected using a probabilistic (random) sampling method. Correlational analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between burnout (including the dimensions of exhaustion and disengagement) and depression. <b>Results:</b> The results indicated that although burnout and depression are closely related, they are not identical phenomena. This conclusion was further supported by the results of confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs), which demonstrated that the dimensions of disengagement and exhaustion did not overlap with the construct of depression. <b>Conclusions:</b> As psychiatrists have observed, individuals diagnosed with burnout often also meet criteria for mental disorders such as somatoform, affective, or anxiety disorders.

40565767,Use of Non-Pharmacological Approaches for Migraine Treatment: Results from the Migraine in Aotearoa New Zealand Survey.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Migraine is a common neurological disease with a high disability burden. Despite this, many people with migraine do not take medication to prevent attacks, even when this is indicated. Many non-pharmacological approaches to migraine treatment exist, but little is known about how people with migraine use these options. <b>Methods:</b> The online Migraine in Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ) Survey collected responses from 530 people with migraine from August to October 2022. Questions included current and previous use of preventive medications, supplements (e.g., magnesium, riboflavin, coenzyme Q10) and complementary therapies (e.g., meditation, biofeedback, yoga, acupuncture). <b>Results:</b> Around half of the respondents were currently using a supplement, 58% were currently using complementary therapy and half were taking preventive medication. One in five were using all three approaches for migraine prevention. Of those not taking preventive medication, 44% were taking a supplement, and 53% were using complementary therapy. For commonly used non-pharmacological approaches, 20-30% of people had tried them in the past but stopped due to lack of efficacy or other reasons. A high proportion of people would like to try approaches that are not readily available or expensive in NZ (e.g., neurostimulation devices and biofeedback). <b>Conclusions:</b> The use of supplements and complementary therapies for migraine prevention is common, often in combination with medication. There are high levels of discontinuation due to ineffectiveness and cost prohibits use for many.

This review systematically summarizes the antidepressant effects of various bioactive compounds found in tea, drawing upon research findings in the field of tea's functional health. It elucidates the impact of tea's bioactive components on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the nervous system, the immune system, intestinal microflora, and the monoaminergic system, among other physiological sites, to achieve antidepressant effects. These effects primarily involve enhancing neural signaling pathways, regulating neural signaling molecule levels, and reducing neuroinflammation. Tea may normalize the body's nervous system by bolstering immune function, alleviating or eliminating cellular inflammation to maintain healthy homeostasis, or improving intestinal flora and mitigating stress to prevent or treat depressive disorders. Additionally, the potential social support derived from tea-drinking activities, such as cultural rituals and interpersonal communication, may contribute to its antidepressant effects. This review discusses and analyzes the current research status regarding the antidepressant effects of tea and highlights that tea and its active ingredients can be utilized to prevent and alleviate depression.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2025.0,Shuangling Xiao; Yi Li; Haiyan Jiang; Sitong Hou; Yaoyao Wang; Di Wang; Jie Teng,< b>:</b > depression commonly know unipolar affective disorder prevalent mental illness contemporary society affect individual vary degree tea major non alcoholic beverage globally rich history consumption associate numerous health nutritional benefit review systematically summarize antidepressant effect bioactive compound find tea draw research finding field tea functional health elucidate impact tea bioactive component hypothalamic pituitary adrenal hpa axis nervous system immune system intestinal microflora monoaminergic system physiological site achieve antidepressant effect effect primarily involve enhance neural signal pathway regulate neural signal molecule level reduce neuroinflammation tea normalize body nervous system bolster immune function alleviate eliminate cellular inflammation maintain healthy homeostasis improve intestinal flora mitigate stress prevent treat depressive disorder additionally potential social support derive tea drinking activity cultural ritual interpersonal communication contribute antidepressant effect review discuss analyze current research status antidepressant effect tea highlight tea active ingredient utilize prevent alleviate depression

However, to understand the implications of a duplication or deletion for a family seeking genetic counseling, it is crucial to know the nature of the underlying chromosomal rearrangement. Here, we present seven cases with apparent isolated copy number loss, five of which showed unexpected complexity. <b>Methods:</b> Seven cases were investigated by CMA due to intellectual disability and/or dysmorphic features. Isolated deletions ranging in size from ~0.6 to ~21 Mb were found and referred for further characterization of the underlying chromosomal rearrangement. To elucidate the cases, fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed using locus-specific, whole and partial chromosome painting and/or multicolor banding. <b>Results:</b> Among the seven selected cases, there were five with unexpected complexity. Isolated deletions were actually evidence of chromoanasynthesis, ring chromosome formation, unbalanced translocation, or unbalanced insertion. <b>Conclusions:</b> These results clearly underscore that it seems reasonable to examine every case with a copy number variant-even if it appears to be ""only"" a simple partial deletion-using banding and/or molecular cytogenetic testing in order to make a qualified assessment of the situation and, on this basis, ensure sound genetic counseling.",Genes,2025.0,Thomas Liehr; Sylke Singer; Ulrike Mau-Holzmann; Stefanie Kankel; Niklas Padutsch; Luisa Person; Eva Daumiller; Uwe Kornak,< b > background objectives:</b > chromosome microarray cma tend line test test require confirmation verification second test understand implication duplication deletion family seek genetic counseling crucial know nature underlie chromosomal rearrangement present seven case apparent isolate copy number loss show unexpected complexity < b > methods:</b > seven case investigate cma intellectual disability and/or dysmorphic feature isolated deletion range size ~0.6 ~21 mb find refer characterization underlie chromosomal rearrangement elucidate case fluorescence situ hybridization perform locus specific partial chromosome painting and/or multicolor banding < b > results:</b > seven select case unexpected complexity isolated deletion actually evidence chromoanasynthesis ring chromosome formation unbalanced translocation unbalanced insertion < b > conclusions:</b > result clearly underscore reasonable examine case copy number variant appear simple partial deletion banding and/or molecular cytogenetic testing order qualified assessment situation basis ensure sound genetic counseling
40565604,Incidence of Homozygous <i>SMN2</i> Deletion in Japan: Cross-Reactivity of <i>SMN2</i> Primers with <i>SMN1</i> Sequence Causes False Negatives in Real-Time PCR Screening.,"<b>Background</b>: <i>SMN1</i> and <i>SMN2</i> are causative and modifier genes, respectively, for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The incidence of <i>SMN1</i> homozygous deletion in Japan is 1 in 20,000. However, the incidence of <i>SMN2</i> homozygous deletion in Japan remains unknown. <b>Methods</b>: To clarify the incidence of homozygous <i>SMN2</i> deletion in Japan, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on dried blood spot (DBS) samples collected from newborns nationwide. Samples with positive or ambiguous results were retested using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and nucleotide sequence analysis. <b>Results</b>: Of the 1000 DBS samples that were screened using real-time PCR, 51 were positive. Retesting using PCR-RFLP analysis identified 10 false results: six false positives and four false negatives. Therefore, there were 49 true positives among the 1000 samples. Notably, nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the false negatives were caused by the cross-reactivity of <i>SMN2</i> primers with <i>SMN1</i> sequences. <b>Conclusions</b>: The incidence of homozygous <i>SMN2</i> deletion in Japan is approximately 1 in 20 people. This incidence is much higher than that of homozygous <i>SMN1</i> deletion and may reflect the vulnerability of the <i>SMN2</i> region. Importantly, the results of the present study suggest that false negatives in the screening process were caused by cross-reactivity with non-target gene sequences.",Genes,2025.0,Makoto Sakima; Yoshihiro Bouike; Shin-Ichi Wada; Masami Nakamae; Yoriko Noguchi; Ryosuke Bo; Hiroyuki Awano; Jumpei Oba; Hisahide Nishio,"< b > background</b > < > smn1</i > < > smn2</i > causative modifi gene respectively spinal muscular atrophy sma incidence < > smn1</i > homozygous deletion japan 1 20,000 incidence < > smn2</i > homozygous deletion japan remain unknown < b > methods</b > clarify incidence homozygous < > smn2</i > deletion japan real time polymerase chain reaction pcr perform dry blood spot dbs sample collect newborn nationwide sample positive ambiguous result reteste pcr restriction fragment length polymorphism pcr rflp nucleotide sequence analysis < b > results</b > 1000 dbs sample screen real time pcr 51 positive reteste pcr rflp analysis identify 10 false result false positive false negative 49 true positive 1000 sample notably nucleotide sequence analysis reveal false negative cause cross reactivity < > smn2</i > primer < > smn1</i > sequence < b > conclusions</b > incidence homozygous < > smn2</i > deletion japan approximately 1 20 people incidence high homozygous < > smn1</i > deletion reflect vulnerability < > smn2</i > region importantly result present study suggest false negative screening process cause cross reactivity non target gene sequence"
40565599,<i>MPDZ</i> Pathogenic Variants Cause Obstructive Ventriculomegaly Related to Diencephalosynapsis and Third Ventricle Atresia.,"Ventriculomegaly is the main prenatal imaging feature for diagnosing fetal central nervous system anomalies in humans. Many ventriculomegalies can be related to genetic causes, regardless of their imaging presentations. Among these, <i>MPDZ</i> variants have been reported to cause severe ventriculomegaly inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (OMIM#615219). Several hypotheses have been put forward linking <i>MPDZ</i> variants to ventriculomegaly, but the precise underlying mechanisms, in particular whether its origin is obstructive or non-obstructive, are yet to be elucidated. To address this question, we retrospectively analyzed pre- and postnatal neuro-imaging and neuropathological data for cases of ventriculomegaly in which <i>MPDZ</i> variants were found through exome or genome sequencing. We performed anti-MPDZ immunostaining on fetal brain samples. We analyzed six cases (four fetuses and two children) of ventriculomegaly of variable severities with <i>MPDZ</i> variants. The precise analysis of brain MRI data, corroborated by fetopathological examinations, demonstrated an obstructive pattern of ventriculomegaly upstream from partial fusion of the thalami, also called diencephalosynapsis, with partial atresia of the third ventricle, which could extend to Sylvius's aqueduct.

The molar tooth sign visible in magnetic resonance imaging of the brain serves as a diagnostic tool for JS. Variants in the <i>TCTN3</i> gene can lead to the development of several diseases, including JS type 18, Orofaciodigital syndrome IV, and Meckel-Gruber syndrome. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in a 49-year-old woman with JS characterized by severe intellectual disability, ataxic gait, agenesis of the cerebellar vermis leading to the molar tooth sign, dystonic movements, strabismus, and nystagmus. Moreover, the patient also showed a thickened corpus callosum. Molecular analysis through WES revealed the heterozygous variants c.182dup (p.G62Wfs*18) and c.1452+4del in the <i>TCTN3</i> gene, expanding our understanding of the genetic diversity and potential phenotypic implications associated with <i>TCTN3</i> variations.

40565582,"Deficiency in KPNA4, but Not in KPNA3, Causes Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder like Symptoms in Mice.","Nucleocytoplasmic transport is crucial for neuronal cell physiology and defects are involved in neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, but also in ageing. Recent studies have suggested, that the classic nuclear import factor adapters KPNA3 (also named importin alpha4) and KPNA4 (also named importin alpha3) could be associated with the development of motor neuron diseases, a condition specifically affecting the neurons projecting from brain to spinal cord or from spinal cord to the muscles. Here we set out to analyze the neuronal function of mice deficient in KPNA3 (<i>Kpna3</i>-KO) or KPNA4 (<i>Kpna4</i>-KO). The motoric abilities and locomotion at different time points in ageing were tested to study the role of these two genes on motor neuron function. While we did not find deficits related to motor neurons in both mouse models, we discovered a hypermotoric phenotype in KPNA4-deficient mice. Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is caused by a combination of genetic, environmental and neurobiological factors and a number of genes have been suggested in genome-wide association studies to contribute to ADHD, including <i>KPNA4</i>.

40565581,Mixed Segmental Uniparental Disomy of Chromosome 15q11-q1 Coexists with Homozygous Variant in <i>GNB5</i> Gene in Child with Prader-Willi and Lodder-Merla Syndrome.,"Uniparental disomy (UPD) refers to the condition in which both chromosomes (or part of chromosome) of a pair are inherited from the same parent. There are two types of UPD: uniparental isodisomy (both chromosomes inherited from one parent are identical copies) and uniparental heterodisomy (two different chromosomes are inherited from one parent). UPD presents two primary developmental risks: recessive trait inheritance or an imprinting disorder. These risks may coexist, leading to an ultra-rare comorbidity. Managing the comorbidities associated with rare diseases presents unique clinical challenges. The existence of such phenomena is evidenced by our case report of a boy who was ultimately diagnosed with two rare diseases: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), due to the maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 (UPD), and autosomal recessive Lodder-Merla type 1 syndrome, linked to a novel pathogenic variant in the G protein subunit β <i>5</i> (<i>GNB5</i>) gene, as detailed in this paper. An unusual or severe phenotype in a patient diagnosed with PWS should invariably prompt the consideration of a comorbid genetic disease attributable to genes located in the PWS critical region of chromosome 15q, or elsewhere on chromosome 15. In cases of epileptic encephalopathy with cardiac arrhythmia, prompt consultation with a cardiologist and comprehensive genetic testing are essential to reduce the risks associated with untreated arrhythmia and ensure the provision of appropriate and safe anti-epileptic therapy. The presented case provides further support for the hypothesis that uniparental disomy may serve as an underlying cause of Lodder-Merla syndrome.

40565571,Epigenetic Clocks and Their Prospective Application in the Complex Landscape of Aging and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Nowadays, scientists are making efforts to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the phenotypic changes underlying the aging process in order to develop favorable therapeutical interventions. Epigenetic modifications, in particular DNA methylation, play a crucial role in the aging process, and this parameter has been used to set epigenetic clocks, algorithms that predict an individual's biological age based on a defined set of CpGs. In this review, we focus on the most recent literature to discuss the use of epigenetic clocks in the context of cognitive decline and dysregulation of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related gene expression. We have summarized all published scientific papers in which epigenetic clocks have been applied to measure age acceleration in blood and brain specimens from patients affected with AD. Progressive age acceleration, consistent with a specific DNA methylation signature, was observed in patients affected by AD, and it was correlated with the onset of complex diseases, mitochondrial alterations, dementia and cognitive decline, even in the early stages of these conditions. The use of epigenetic clocks might be a valuable biomarker to enable an earlier identification of ideal measures to reverse modifications caused by aging and to mitigate multiple aspects of disease/aging mechanisms.",Genes,2025.0,Annamaria Cerantonio; Beatrice Maria Greco; Luigi Citrigno; Selene De Benedittis; Antonio Qualtieri; Raffaele Maletta; Alberto Montesanto; Giuseppe Passarino; Patrizia Spadafora; Francesca Cavalcanti,nowadays scientist make effort elucidate mechanism involve phenotypic change underlie age process order develop favorable therapeutical intervention epigenetic modification particular dna methylation play crucial role age process parameter set epigenetic clock algorithm predict individual biological age base define set cpgs review focus recent literature discuss use epigenetic clock context cognitive decline dysregulation alzheimer disease ad)-relate gene expression summarize publish scientific paper epigenetic clock apply measure age acceleration blood brain specimen patient affect ad progressive age acceleration consistent specific dna methylation signature observe patient affect ad correlate onset complex disease mitochondrial alteration dementia cognitive decline early stage condition use epigenetic clock valuable biomarker enable early identification ideal measure reverse modification cause aging mitigate multiple aspect disease age mechanism
40565564,Auditory Event-Related Potentials in Two Rat Models of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: Evidence of Automatic Attention Deficits in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats but Not in Latrophilin-3 Knockout Rats.,"Variations of the latrophilin-3 (<i>Lphn3</i>) gene have been associated with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). To explore the functional influence of this gene, <i>Lphn3</i> knockout (KO) rats were generated and have thus far demonstrated deficits in ADHD-relevant phenotypes, including working memory, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. However, inattention remains unexplored. We assessed automatic attention in <i>Lphn3</i> KO (n = 19) and their control line (wildtype/WT, n = 20) through use of the following auditory event-related potentials (ERPs): P1, N1, P2, and N2. We also extended this exploratory study by comparing these same ERPs in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs, n = 16), the most commonly studied animal model of ADHD, to their control line (Wistar-Kyoto/WKY, n = 20). Electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded using subdermal needle electrodes at frontocentral sites while freely moving rats were presented with five-tone trains (50 ms tones, 400 ms tone onset asynchronies) with varying short (1 s) and long (5 s) inter-train intervals. Peak amplitudes and latencies were analyzed using GLM-mixed ANOVAs to assess differences across genotypes (KO vs. WTs) and strains (SHRs vs. WKYs). The KOs did not demonstrate any significant differences in peak amplitudes relative to the WT controls, suggesting that the null expression of <i>Lphn3</i> does not result in the development of inefficiencies in automatic attention. However, the SHRs exhibited significantly reduced peak P1 (and peak-to-peak P1-N1) values relative to the WKYs. These attenuations likely reflect inefficiencies in bottom-up arousal networks that are necessary for efficient automatic processing. Distinct findings between these animal models likely reflect differing alterations in dopamine and noradrenaline neurotransmission that may underlie ADHD-relevant phenotypes.",Genes,2025.0,Logan M Brewer; Jankiben Patel; Frank Andrasik; Jeffrey J Sable; Michael T Williams; Charles V Vorhees; Helen J K Sable,variation latrophilin-3 < > lphn3</i > gene associate attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd explore functional influence gene < > lphn3</i > knockout ko rat generate far demonstrate deficit adhd relevant phenotype include work memory impulsivity hyperactivity inattention remain unexplored assess automatic attention < > lphn3</i > ko n = 19 control line wildtype wt n = 20 use follow auditory event relate potential erp p1 n1 p2 n2 extend exploratory study compare erp spontaneously hypertensive rat shrs n = 16 commonly study animal model adhd control line wistar kyoto wky n = 20 electroencephalograms eeg record subdermal needle electrode frontocentral site freely move rat present tone train 50 ms tone 400 ms tone onset asynchrony vary short 1 s long 5 s inter train interval peak amplitude latency analyze glm mix anova assess difference genotype ko vs. wts strain shrs vs. wkys ko demonstrate significant difference peak amplitude relative wt control suggest null expression < > lphn3</i > result development inefficiency automatic attention shrs exhibit significantly reduce peak p1 peak peak p1 n1 value relative wky attenuation likely reflect inefficiency arousal network necessary efficient automatic processing distinct finding animal model likely reflect differ alteration dopamine noradrenaline neurotransmission underlie adhd relevant phenotype
40565562,A Novel Recurrent 200 kb <i>CRYL1</i> Deletion Underlies DFNB1A Hearing Loss in Patients from Northwestern Spain.,"Pathogenic recessive <i>GJB2</i> variants are the main genetic cause of non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss. However, following <i>GJB2</i> testing, a significant proportion of deaf patients are only found to be heterozygous carriers of pathogenic <i>GJB2</i> alleles. Five large deletions not affecting <i>GJB2</i> but encompassing a minimal common 62 kb region within the neighbouring <i>CRYL1</i> gene have been described to cause loss of <i>cis GJB2</i> expression and, as a result, produce hearing loss when in <i>trans</i> with pathogenic <i>GJB2</i> variants. We describe the identification and characterization of a novel deletion of this type in deaf patients from northwestern Spain. We used panel NGS sequencing to detect the deletion, MLPA to validate it, whole-genome sequencing to map its breakpoints, PCR + Sanger sequencing to finely characterize it and triple-primer PCR to screen for it. We identified a novel 200 kb deletion spanning the whole <i>CRYL1</i> gene in two unrelated deaf patients from Asturias (in northwestern Spain) who were heterozygous for the pathogenic <i>GJB2</i> c.35delG variant. Although the large deletion was absent from gnomAD v4.1.0 and 2052 local control alleles, screening for it in 20 additional deaf carriers of monoallelic pathogenic <i>GJB2</i> variants detected it in another patient from Galicia (also in northwestern Spain).

40565557,The Complex Role of the miR-17-92 Cluster in Stroke: Mechanistic Insights and Biomarker Potential.,"Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with ischemic stroke (IS) accounting for approximately 85% of cases. Recent research has highlighted the critical role of microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNA molecules, in the pathogenesis of stroke. Among these, the miR-17-92 cluster and its paralogs have emerged as key regulators in the development of stroke pathology and the subsequent recovery processes. We emphasize their regulatory roles in key pathological processes, including inflammation, apoptosis, neuroprotection, and tissue repair. We provide an overview of these mechanisms to support the identification of novel miRNA-based therapeutic targets and to improve stroke diagnosis, treatment, and recovery strategies. Specific miRNAs, such as miR-19a, miR-18a, and miR-92a, contribute to processes including neurogenesis, axonal growth, and a reduction in neuronal apoptosis. The miR-17-92 cluster also offers potential therapeutic applications by targeting injury-induced pathways, such as modulating apoptosis, promoting axonal elongation, or inhibiting neurodegeneration.

40565550,Comparative Analysis of MBNL1 Antibodies: Characterization of Recognition Sites and Detection of RNA Foci Colocalization.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> MBNL1 is an RNA-binding protein involved in RNA metabolism, including splicing. It colocalizes with RNA foci, a pathological hallmark of myotonic dystrophy, and plays a central role in its disease mechanism. Moreover, MBNL1 has been implicated in other neuromuscular disorders and cancers. In these pathological and biochemical studies, the detection of MBNL1 using antibodies is essential. Given that MBNL1 has multiple splicing-derived isoforms, different antibodies may recognize distinct isoforms. This study aims to compare six commercially available antibodies regarding their specificity in Western blotting, colocalization with RNA foci, and suitability for immunoprecipitation. <b>Methods</b>: Western blot analysis was performed using MBNL1 isoforms and deletion mutants expressed in HEK293 cells, as well as endogenous MBNL1 from various cell lines. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunofluorescence (IF) were conducted in DM1 model cells and patient-derived fibroblasts to assess MBNL1 colocalization with RNA foci. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in HEK293 cells to evaluate antibody suitability for protein isolation. <b>Results</b>: Western blot analysis revealed that different antibodies target distinct regions of MBNL1, with three recognizing exon 3 and the remaining antibodies recognizing exon 4, exon 5, and exon 6, respectively. In the FISH-IF experiments, the clarity of RNA foci colocalization varied depending on the antibody used, with some antibodies failing to detect colocalization. The immunoprecipitation analysis showed that four antibodies were able to isolate endogenous MBNL1. <b>Conclusions</b>: This study clarifies the recognition properties and application suitability of MBNL1 antibodies, providing a valuable resource for research on MBNL1-related diseases and RNA metabolism.",Genes,2025.0,Yoshitaka Aoki; Ai Ohki; Motoaki Yanaizu; Yoshihiro Kino,< b > background objectives:</b > mbnl1 rna bind protein involve rna metabolism include splicing colocalize rna foci pathological hallmark myotonic dystrophy play central role disease mechanism mbnl1 implicate neuromuscular disorder cancer pathological biochemical study detection mbnl1 antibody essential give mbnl1 multiple splicing derive isoform different antibody recognize distinct isoform study aim compare commercially available antibody specificity western blotting colocalization rna foci suitability immunoprecipitation < b > methods</b > western blot analysis perform mbnl1 isoform deletion mutant express hek293 cell endogenous mbnl1 cell line rna fluorescence situ hybridization fish immunofluorescence conduct dm1 model cell patient derive fibroblast assess mbnl1 colocalization rna focus immunoprecipitation experiment perform hek293 cell evaluate antibody suitability protein isolation < b > results</b > western blot analysis reveal different antibody target distinct region mbnl1 recognize exon 3 remain antibody recognize exon 4 exon 5 exon 6 respectively fish experiment clarity rna foci colocalization vary depend antibody antibody fail detect colocalization immunoprecipitation analysis show antibody able isolate endogenous mbnl1 < b > conclusions</b > study clarify recognition property application suitability mbnl1 antibody provide valuable resource research mbnl1 relate disease rna metabolism
40565537,Clinical Efficacy of Selumetinib in Alleviating Neuropathic Pain Associated with Plexiform Neurofibroma: A Case Series.,"<b>Background</b>: Selumetinib, an MEK inhibitor, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April 2020 and became reimbursable in Italy in January 2020, for treating patients aged ≥3 years with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) complicated by symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PNs). Selumetinib has been shown to effectively reduce the volume of target PNs and alleviate neuropathic pain even in long-term-treated patients. We report the impact of Selumetinib on pain in three NF1 cases with inoperable symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas. <b>Case Series</b>: Three patients with NF1 (aged 13-27 years) presented with symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) associated with severe neuropathic pain.

40565534,Investigating the Role of <i>B9D1</i> in Meckel-Gruber Syndrome: A Case Report and Comprehensive Literature Review.,"Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS) is a rare autosomal recessive lethal ciliopathy, characterized by occipital encephalocele, cystic kidneys, and postaxial polydactyly, caused by mutations in different genes. Its significant genetic heterogeneity along with its clinical overlap with other ciliopathies makes early diagnosis essential for clinical management, accurate genetic counseling, and informing future reproductive decisions. This study aims to describe a prenatally diagnosed case carrying a homozygous <i>B9D1</i> variant and to examine the current literature on all variants reported in this gene associated with MKS. We comprehensively review the current literature on pathogenic <i>B9D1</i> variants implicated in this syndrome. Additionally, we describe a case, presenting multiple congenital anomalies suggestive of MKS, genetically diagnosed by clinical exome sequencing on chorionic villi. Occipital encephalocele and polycystic kidneys were revealed via ultrasound, thus suggesting MKS. Genetic testing identified the homozygous c.151T>C (p.Ser51Pro) variant in the <i>B9D1</i> gene, inherited from healthy parents.

40565533,Variant Ataxia-Telangiectasia Presenting as Tremor-Dystonia Syndrome in a Bulgarian Religious Minority.,"<b>Background:</b> Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in the <i>ATM</i> gene. Given the residual kinase activity and the type of <i>ATM</i> mutation, its clinical spectrum varies from a severe classic phenotype to a variant atypical form. <b>Material and methods:</b> This study included 28 patients belonging to four big Bulgarian Muslim pedigrees with tremor and dystonia. Whole-exome sequencing was performed in seven affected individuals from two unrelated pedigrees, followed by Sanger sequencing of the coding sequences and exon-intron borders of the <i>ATM</i> gene. <b>Results:</b> Twenty-four of the affected individuals were homozygous for c.8147T>C (p.Val2716Ala) in <i>ATM</i>, while four of the affected individuals were compound heterozygous. The targeted Sanger sequencing along the <i>ATM</i> gene revealed as a second mutation in three of the patients the splice-site variant c.4909+1G>A and in one patient a synonymous pathogenic variant with a splicing effect, c.3576G>A, p.Lys1192. The age at onset in our group varied between 14 days and 40 years. The main symptoms were dystonia and tremor, more prominent in the upper limbs and the neck, and dystonic dysarthria and dysphagia. The clinical course was very slowly progressive. Brain imaging was normal in the majority of the patients. <b>Conclusion:</b> Clinical features due to mutations in the <i>ATM</i> gene can be very broad.

40565527,Retinal Changes in Early-Onset cblC Methylmalonic Acidemia Identified Through Expanded Newborn Screening: Highlights from a Case Study and Literature Review.,"Methylmalonic acidemia combined with homocystinuria (cblC) can lead to infantile maculopathy. Although significant visual deterioration is commonly reported in early-onset cblC, we found poor awareness regarding formal assessments of ocular complications, especially in newborns, and of how these complications relate to the timing of therapy initiation. In this work, we present our experience and perform a literature review. We performed sequential fundus examinations, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and full-field electroretinography (ERG) under sedation following detection of signs of retinal degeneration. We also assessed visual fields using kinetic attraction perimetry. We report a newborn who was referred on the eighth day of life, following a diagnosis of cblC through newborn screening (NBS), and who began treatment that same day. Close monitoring of retinal changes through fundus examinations allowed the detection of signs of retinal degeneration at 3 months, which progressed when checked at 5 months. At 7 months, OCT showed retinal thinning with the appearance of bull's eye maculopathy in the corresponding region on fundoscopy; ERG revealed a reduction in the amplitude of both scotopic and photopic components, whereas kinetic attraction perimetry showed no abnormalities. Genetic investigation confirmed the disease, compound heterozygous for a nonsense variant in <i>MMACHC</i> and a splicing one in <i>PRDX1</i>. In cblC, retinal degeneration occurs in the first months of life despite timely treatment and adequate biochemical control, and it may manifest before any signs of visual deprivation appear. However, there is an early, narrow window during which therapy may slow down retinal degeneration enough to prevent sensory nystagmus. We recommend initiating therapy immediately after biochemical diagnosis, along with close ophthalmological monitoring, before the appearance of any signs.",Genes,2025.0,Paola Michieletto; Francesco Baldo; Maurizio Madonia; Luisa Zupin; Stefano Pensiero; Maria Teresa Bonati,methylmalonic acidemia combine homocystinuria cblc lead infantile maculopathy significant visual deterioration commonly report early onset cblc find poor awareness formal assessment ocular complication especially newborn complication relate timing therapy initiation work present experience perform literature review perform sequential fundus examination optical coherence tomography oct field electroretinography erg sedation follow detection sign retinal degeneration assess visual field kinetic attraction perimetry report newborn refer eighth day life follow diagnosis cblc newborn screening nbs begin treatment day close monitoring retinal change fundus examination allow detection sign retinal degeneration 3 month progress check 5 month 7 month oct show retinal thinning appearance bull eye maculopathy correspond region fundoscopy erg reveal reduction amplitude scotopic photopic component kinetic attraction perimetry show abnormality genetic investigation confirm disease compound heterozygous nonsense variant < > mmachc</i > splicing < > prdx1</i > cblc retinal degeneration occur month life despite timely treatment adequate biochemical control manifest sign visual deprivation appear early narrow window therapy slow retinal degeneration prevent sensory nystagmus recommend initiate therapy immediately biochemical diagnosis close ophthalmological monitoring appearance sign
40565523,Phase Determination and Demonstration of Parental Mosaicism of Intragenic <i>PRKN</i> Deletions Initially Identified by Chromosomal Microarray Analysis.,"Autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinson disease (ARJP) is an early-onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by Parkinsonian motor symptoms with slow progression and preserved cognition. Biallelic pathogenic variants within the <i>PRKN</i> gene are associated with ARJP. Among <i>PRKN</i> pathogenic variants, deletions are a frequent occurrence and may be identified through chromosomal microarray testing. Here we present a case with two intragenic <i>PRKN</i> deletions initially identified as a secondary finding using chromosomal microarray. One deletion was paternally inherited and the second initially appeared to be de novo. In addition to microarray which initially identified the two deletions, long-range GAP-PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to further characterize the de novo deletion and phase of the deletions. Molecular characterization of the apparently de novo deletion demonstrated low-level maternal mosaicism of this deletion, thus proving that these deletions are in trans in the proband, yielding a diagnosis of autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinson disease. This case highlights the utility of a diagnostic approach combining microarray, long-range PCR, and Sanger sequencing to establish the phase and confirm biallelic <b><i>PRKN</i></b> deletions in a patient with ARJP.

40565516,Clinical and Genetic Spectrum of Patients with Pediatric-Onset Epilepsy: Insights from a Single-Center Study.,"<b>Objective:</b> Epilepsy, a common neurological disorder marked by recurrent seizures often starting in childhood, has a complex etiology. Advances in high-throughput sequencing now confirm that 70-80% of cases have a genetic basis. Accordingly, this study aims to evaluate the clinical relevance of genetic variations detected through epilepsy panels and whole exome sequencing (WES) in pediatric-onset epilepsy patients. <b>Methods:</b> For this study, we enrolled a cohort of pediatric patients involving 205 subjects with a preliminary diagnosis of epilepsy. Targeted next-generation sequencing panels for epilepsy and whole exome sequencing was performed using the NextSeq 500 platform. The results were analyzed with the QIAGEN Clinical Insight bioinformatic platform and were further confirmed and approved by the Human Genome Mutation Database and ClinVar databases. <b>Results:</b> In this study, an epilepsy panel was conducted in 138 patients, and whole exome sequencing was performed in 67 patients. No clinically relevant variants were identified in 29 (21.0%) patients who underwent the epilepsy panel and 27 (40.3%) patients who underwent WES. Variants were detected in 128 different genes in the epilepsy panel group and in 54 different genes in the WES group, with the frequency of these variants limited to one or two patients. <b>Significance:</b> In both the epilepsy panel and WES groups, variants in sodium channel proteins, specifically in the SCN1A, SCN8A, and SCN9A genes, were found to have a high frequency.

40565515,The Role of Non-Coding RNAs in ALS.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, and eventually death. The pathogenesis of ALS is influenced by genetic factors, environmental factors, and age-related dysfunctions. These factors, taken together, are responsible for sporadic cases of ALS, which account for approximately 85-90% of ALS cases, while familial ALS accounts for the remaining 10-15% of cases, usually with dominant traits. Despite advances in understanding and studying the disease, the cause of the onset of ALS remains unknown. Emerging evidence suggests that non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of the disease. An abnormal expression of these molecules is implicated in various ALS-related processes, including motor neuron survival, protein aggregation, and inflammation. Here, we describe the dysregulation of non-coding RNAs in the pathogenic mechanism of ALS, highlighting the potential roles of miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs as biomarkers or therapeutic targets to examine the progression of the disease.",Genes,2025.0,Alessandra Falduti; Adele Giovinazzo; Elisa Lo Feudo; Valentina Rocca; Filippo Brighina; Angela Messina; Francesca Luisa Conforti; Rodolfo Iuliano,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als progressive neurodegenerative disease affect motor neuron lead muscle weakness paralysis eventually death pathogenesis als influence genetic factor environmental factor age relate dysfunction factor take responsible sporadic case als account approximately 85 90 als case familial als account remain 10 15 case usually dominant trait despite advance understanding study disease cause onset als remain unknown emerge evidence suggest non coding rnas include micrornas mirnas long non coding rnas lncrnas circular rnas circrnas play crucial role pathogenesis disease abnormal expression molecule implicate als relate process include motor neuron survival protein aggregation inflammation describe dysregulation non coding rnas pathogenic mechanism als highlight potential role mirnas lncrnas circrnas biomarker therapeutic target examine progression disease
40565514,Decoding Neuromuscular Disorders: The Complex Role of Genetic and Epigenetic Regulators.,"Neuromuscular disorders (NMDs), such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and muscular dystrophies (e.g., Duchenne muscular dystrophy, DMD), are primarily driven by genetic mutations but are critically modulated by epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNA activity. These epigenetic processes contribute to phenotypic variability and disease progression, and emerging evidence suggests that environmental factors, particularly nutrition and exercise, may further influence the molecular pathways that modulate these diseases. Dietary bioactive compounds (e.g., polyphenols and omega-3 fatty acids) exhibit epigenetic modulatory properties, which could mitigate oxidative stress, inflammation, and muscle degeneration in NMDs. For example, the inhibition of DNMTs and HDACs by curcumin in ALS models and the promyogenic effects of green tea catechins in DMD suggest plausible, though still requiring investigation, therapeutic avenues. However, the clinical application of nutriepigenetic interventions is preliminary and requires further validation. This review examines the interaction of genetic and epigenetic factors in ALS, SMA, and muscular dystrophies, highlighting their combined role in the heterogeneity of these diseases. Integrative therapeutic strategies combining gene therapies, epigenetic modulators, and lifestyle interventions may offer a multidimensional approach to the management of NMD.

40565480,Digitalization in Dentistry: Dentists' Perceptions of Digital Stressors and Resources and Their Association with Digital Stress in Germany-A Qualitative Study.,"<b>Background</b>: The digital transformation in dentistry is increasingly reshaping treatment procedures, offering new opportunities and advancements. While digitalization promises enhanced efficiency and quality of care through the standardization, acceleration, and simplification of workflows, it also introduces challenges related to mental health. Studies investigating digitization-associated stressors and resources, as well as health- and work-related outcomes, in the dental sector are still rare. In the context of ongoing digitalization, further studies are needed to examine the need for and the current status of the implementation of measures preventing techno-stress and stress-related outcomes. This study explores the use of digital tools in dental practices and their relationship to the techno-stress among German dentists. It identifies key stressors and resources associated with digital technologies, aiming to inform preventive measures, as well as training and support strategies to mitigate digital stress. <b>Methods</b>: A qualitative study was employed, involving ten problem-centered, guideline-based expert interviews with German dentists. The interviews were analyzed using MAXQDA software, following the focused interview analysis framework by Kuckartz and Rädiker. Coding and thematic analysis adhered to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) checklist and qualitative research quality criteria by Mayring. <b>Results</b>: This study identified a dual impact of digitalization in dentistry. On the one hand, digital tools significantly enhance workflow efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, and patient outcomes. On the other hand, they pose challenges like technostress, high financial costs, and the need for continuous learning. Findings reveal that the perceived usefulness of digital technologies is closely linked to the level of techno-stress experienced, while the amount, intuitiveness, and ease of use significantly influence stress levels. <b>Conclusions</b>: Digital transformation offers substantial benefits for dental practices but requires a balanced approach to implementation. Participants highlighted the need for proactive measures, such as targeted training, technical support, and stress-reducing interventions to reduce techno-stress levels. The digital transformation must be supported by coordinated efforts across academia, industry, and policy to strengthen digital competencies-creating a healthier, more resilient digital work environment.

40565369,Neurobiological Mechanisms of Electroconvulsive Therapy: Molecular Perspectives of Brain Stimulation.,"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains one of the most effective interventions for treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders, particularly major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. Despite extensive clinical and preclinical investigations, the precise neurobiological mechanisms underlying ECT's therapeutic effects are not fully understood. This review explores the molecular and cellular pathways involved in ECT, emphasizing its impact on neurotrophic signaling, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and neuroplasticity. Evidence suggests that ECT modulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor and other neurotrophic factors, promoting synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival. Additionally, ECT influences the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, reduces neuroinflammation, and alters neurotransmitter systems, contributing to its antidepressant effects. Recent findings also highlight the role of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress regulation in ECT-induced neural adaptation. By synthesizing current molecular insights, this review provides a comprehensive perspective on the neurobiological mechanisms of ECT, offering potential directions for future research and therapeutic advancements in brain stimulation.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Ermin Fetahovic; Vladimir Janjic; Maja Muric; Nemanja Jovicic; Branimir Radmanovic; Gvozden Rosic; Dragica Selakovic; Milos Filipovic; Nemanja Muric,electroconvulsive therapy ect remain effective intervention treatment resistant psychiatric disorder particularly major depressive disorder bipolar disorder despite extensive clinical preclinical investigation precise neurobiological mechanism underlie ect therapeutic effect fully understand review explore molecular cellular pathway involve ect emphasize impact neurotrophic signaling oxidative stress apoptosis neuroplasticity evidence suggest ect modulate brain derive neurotrophic factor neurotrophic factor promote synaptic plasticity neuronal survival additionally ect influence hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis reduce neuroinflammation alter neurotransmitter system contribute antidepressant effect recent finding highlight role mitochondrial function oxidative stress regulation ect induce neural adaptation synthesize current molecular insight review provide comprehensive perspective neurobiological mechanism ect offer potential direction future research therapeutic advancement brain stimulation
40565362,Steroidomic Changes in the Cerebrospinal Fluid of Women with Multiple Sclerosis.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a long-term disease that causes inflammation and damage to the nervous system. This study evaluated steroidomic alterations related to MS in 57 female MS patients during the follicular phase and 17 during the luteal phase, as well as in age- and phase-matched controls. The data showed that (1) unconjugated and conjugated steroids were strongly linked between the blood and CSF. (2) MS patients have lower levels of unconjugated steroids compared to controls. However, unchanged levels of conjugated steroids suggest a possible increase in steroid sulfotransferase functioning. (3) MS patients show altered levels of steroids linked to 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1) function. While direct enzyme activity was not measured, disrupted cortisol biosynthesis-potentially linked to reduced functioning of both CYP11B1 and 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase-is associated with more severe cases of MS. (4) Reduced levels of 5α/β-steroids and protective GABAergic 3α-hydroxy-5α/β-steroids in MS patients might be linked to the pathophysiology of MS. (5) A potential increase in AKR1C3 function in MS could contribute to inflammation, as this enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of both steroids and prostaglandins. However, direct measurements of enzyme activity are needed to confirm this hypothesis. (6) Lower pregnenolone levels in MS patients might weaken neuroprotection, while higher pregnenolone sulfate levels could support cognitive function. (7) Lower levels of protective pregnenolone, DHEA, and androstenediol were associated with worse MS, suggesting these steroids may help shield against the disease.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Radmila Kancheva; Eva Kubala Havrdová; Marta Velíková; Ludmila Kancheva; Josef Včelák; Radek Ampapa; Michal Židó; Ivana Štětkářová; Tereza Škodová; Martin Hill,"multiple sclerosis ms long term disease cause inflammation damage nervous system study evaluate steroidomic alteration relate ms 57 female ms patient follicular phase 17 luteal phase age- phase match control datum show 1 unconjugate conjugate steroid strongly link blood csf 2 ms patient low level unconjugated steroid compare control unchanged level conjugate steroid suggest possible increase steroid sulfotransferase functioning 3 ms patient altered level steroid link 11β hydroxylase cyp11b1 function direct enzyme activity measure disrupt cortisol biosynthesis potentially link reduce functioning cyp11b1 17α hydroxylase/17,20 lyase associate severe case ms 4 reduced level 5α β steroid protective gabaergic 3α hydroxy-5α β steroid ms patient link pathophysiology ms 5 potential increase akr1c3 function ms contribute inflammation enzyme catalyze synthesis steroid prostaglandin direct measurement enzyme activity need confirm hypothesis 6 low pregnenolone level ms patient weaken neuroprotection high pregnenolone sulfate level support cognitive function 7 low level protective pregnenolone dhea androstenediol associate bad ms suggest steroid help shield disease"
40565361,A Bridge Too Far? Towards Medical Therapy for Clinically Nonfunctioning Pituitary Tumors.,"Clinically nonfunctioning pituitary tumors (CNFPTs) typically do not cause hormonal excess, progress insidiously, and are often large and invasive at presentation. Complete resection is frequently not attainable; radiotherapy (RT) may effectively limit growth but carries a significant risk of hypopituitarism. Medical therapy with dopamine D2 receptor agonists and/or somatostatin analogs has been explored in CNFPTs but have yielded inconsistent results, and there is an unmet need for novel efficacious and safe medical therapies. The authors used the PubMed database to identify and review articles published from January 1982 to July 2024, that discussed the medical treatment of CNFPTs. The most commonly studied medical therapies were somatostatin receptor ligands (SRLs) and dopamine D2 receptor agonists. Of 111 patients with CNFPTs treated with SRLs, 31 (28%) exhibited tumor shrinkage. Following dopamine agonist treatment in 355 patients, tumor shrinkage occurred in 113 (32%), tumor stabilization in 182 (51%), and tumor growth in 60 (17%). The efficacy of other less commonly employed therapies such as GnRH analogs, PRRT, and temozolomide was also reviewed.

40565357,Analysis of the Expression Patterns of Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha Signaling Pathways and Regulatory MicroRNAs in Astrocytic Tumors.,"Chronic inflammation is increasingly recognized as a driver of glioma progression, with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) playing a central role in modulating the tumor microenvironment. This study aimed to investigate the expression profiles and regulatory mechanisms of TNF-α and its downstream mediators-including interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase 8 (MAP3K8), and Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase <i>7</i> (MAP2K7)-in astrocytic tumors of varying malignancy. We conducted an integrative molecular analysis of 60 human astrocytic tumor samples (20 G2, 12 G3, 28 G4) using transcriptomic microarrays, Reverse Transcription Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR), Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, methylation-specific PCR, and miRNA profiling. Prognostic associations were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analyses. TNF-α, IL-1β, and MAP3K8 were significantly upregulated in high-grade tumors, with log<sub>2</sub> fold changes ranging from 5.56 to 8.76 (<i>p</i> < 0.001). High expression of TNF-α (HR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.27-3.46, <i>p</i> = 0.004), IL-1β (HR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.45-3.82, <i>p</i> = 0.001), and MAP3K8 (Hazard Ratio; HR = 1.88, 95% confidence interval; 95% CI: 1.12-3.16, <i>p</i> = 0.015) was associated with poorer overall survival. miR-34a-3p and miR-30 family members, predicted to target TNF-α and IL-1β, were markedly downregulated in G3/G4 tumors (e.g., miR-30e-3p fold change: -3.78, <i>p</i> < 0.01). Promoter hypomethylation was observed in G3/G4 tumors, supporting epigenetic activation. Our findings establish a multi-layered regulatory mechanism of TNF-α signaling in astrocytic tumors.

40565338,The Circadian Rhythm Gene Network Could Distinguish Molecular Profile and Prognosis for Glioblastoma.,"Increasing evidence highlights the role of aberrant circadian rhythm gene expression in glioblastoma (GBM) progression, but the impact of the circadian rhythm gene network on GBM molecular profiles and prognosis remains unclear. A total of 1042 GBM samples from six public datasets, TCGA and CGGA, were analyzed, with GBM samples stratified into three circadian core-gene patterns using unsupervised clustering based on the expression profiles of 17 circadian rhythm genes. The Limma R package identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among the three patterns, and a secondary clustering system, termed circadian-related gene pattern, was established based on DEGs. A circadian risk score was constructed using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression algorithm, and the efficiency of these patterns and the circadian risk score in distinguishing molecular profiles and predicting prognosis was systematically analyzed. The relationship between the circadian risk score and response to immune or targeted therapy was examined using the GSE78200 and IMvigor210 datasets. The results showed that GBM patients were clustered into three circadian core-gene patterns based on the expression profiles of 17 core circadian genes, with distinct molecular profiles, malignant characteristics, and patient prognoses among the patterns. Thirty-two DEGs among these patterns were identified and termed circadian-related genes, and secondary clustering based on these 32 DEGs classified GBM samples into two circadian-related gene patterns, which also predicted molecular profiles and prognosis. A circadian risk scoring system was established, allowing the calculation of individual risk scores based on the expression of 10 genes, where GBM patients with lower circadian risk scores had prolonged overall survival and less aggressive molecular subtypes, while higher circadian risk scores correlated with better responses to MAPK-targeted therapy. In conclusion, this study established two clustering patterns based on 17 circadian rhythm genes or 32 circadian-related genes, enabling the rapid classification of GBM patients with distinct molecular profiles and prognoses, while the circadian risk scoring system effectively predicted survival, molecular profiles, and therapeutic responses for individual GBM patients, demonstrating that the circadian rhythm gene network can distinguish molecular profiles and prognosis in GBM.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Fangzhu Wan; Zongpu Zhang; Jinsen Zhang; Jiyi Hu; Weixu Hu; Jing Gao; Minjie Fu; Yuan Feng; Lin Kong,increase evidence highlight role aberrant circadian rhythm gene expression glioblastoma gbm progression impact circadian rhythm gene network gbm molecular profile prognosis remain unclear total 1042 gbm sample public dataset tcga cgga analyze gbm sample stratify circadian core gene pattern unsupervised clustering base expression profile 17 circadian rhythm gene limma r package identify differentially express gene deg pattern secondary cluster system term circadian relate gene pattern establish base deg circadian risk score construct absolute shrinkage selection operator lasso regression algorithm efficiency pattern circadian risk score distinguish molecular profile predict prognosis systematically analyze relationship circadian risk score response immune target therapy examine gse78200 imvigor210 dataset result show gbm patient cluster circadian core gene pattern base expression profile 17 core circadian gene distinct molecular profile malignant characteristic patient prognosis pattern thirty deg pattern identify term circadian relate gene secondary clustering base 32 deg classify gbm sample circadian relate gene pattern predict molecular profile prognosis circadian risk scoring system establish allow calculation individual risk score base expression 10 gene gbm patient low circadian risk score prolong overall survival aggressive molecular subtype high circadian risk score correlate well response mapk target therapy conclusion study establish cluster pattern base 17 circadian rhythm gene 32 circadian relate gene enable rapid classification gbm patient distinct molecular profile prognosis circadian risk scoring system effectively predict survival molecular profile therapeutic response individual gbm patient demonstrate circadian rhythm gene network distinguish molecular profile prognosis gbm
40565322,An Experimental Rat Model for Simultaneous Induction of Peripheral Neuropathy and Myelotoxicity by Docetaxel Administration: Evaluating the Protective Role of Dimethyl Fumarate.,"Docetaxel is extensively used for treating different types of cancer; however, its clinical efficacy is primarily limited by myelotoxicity and peripheral neuropathy, adverse effects that often lead to treatment discontinuation. This study aimed to establish a preclinical model in Wistar rats for the simultaneous induction of myelotoxicity and peripheral neuropathy associated with docetaxel administration, enabling the evaluation of potential chemopreventive agents. Four distinct docetaxel administration schemes were assessed by performing behavioral nociceptive tests and complete blood cell counts. After establishing the damage model (5 mg/kg/week docetaxel for six weeks), we co-administered 100 mg/kg/week oral dimethyl fumarate to assess its protective effect. Dimethyl fumarate attenuated docetaxel-induced hyperalgesia, likely through preserving normal nerve fiber density in sciatic nerves, but neutropenia was not significantly mitigated. An alternative regimen with additional pre-administered doses of dimethyl fumarate showed a trend toward neutropenia attenuation and suggested an interesting inhibition of docetaxel-induced rat vibrissae loss. Chou-Talalay isobolographic analyses on prostate cancer cell lines revealed that dimethyl fumarate does not impair the therapeutic effect of docetaxel at most combination ratios evaluated; rather, synergistic effects were observed. This experimental model proved useful and will facilitate further research into the protective role of dimethyl fumarate and other potential chemoprotective agents.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Sebastian Cubides-Cely; Alexander David Castro; Pablo Prado-Guevara; Julio César Mantilla-Hernández; Mario Negrette-Guzmán,docetaxel extensively treat different type cancer clinical efficacy primarily limit myelotoxicity peripheral neuropathy adverse effect lead treatment discontinuation study aim establish preclinical model wistar rat simultaneous induction myelotoxicity peripheral neuropathy associate docetaxel administration enable evaluation potential chemopreventive agent distinct docetaxel administration scheme assess perform behavioral nociceptive test complete blood cell count establish damage model 5 mg kg week docetaxel week co administer 100 mg kg week oral dimethyl fumarate assess protective effect dimethyl fumarate attenuate docetaxel induce hyperalgesia likely preserve normal nerve fiber density sciatic nerve neutropenia significantly mitigate alternative regimen additional pre administered dose dimethyl fumarate show trend neutropenia attenuation suggest interesting inhibition docetaxel induce rat vibrissa loss chou talalay isobolographic analysis prostate cancer cell line reveal dimethyl fumarate impair therapeutic effect docetaxel combination ratio evaluate synergistic effect observe experimental model prove useful facilitate research protective role dimethyl fumarate potential chemoprotective agent
40565321,Myostatin Modulation in Spinal Muscular Atrophy: A Systematic Review of Preclinical and Clinical Evidence.,"Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disorder characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons and consequent muscle atrophy. Although SMN-targeted therapies have significantly improved survival and motor outcomes, residual muscle weakness remains a major clinical challenge, particularly in patients treated later in the disease course. Myostatin, a potent negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass, has emerged as a promising therapeutic target to address this gap. This review summarizes the preclinical and clinical evidence supporting the modulation of the myostatin pathway in SMA. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that inhibiting myostatin, especially when combined with SMN-enhancing agents, can increase muscle mass, improve motor function, and enhance neuromuscular connectivity in SMA mouse models. These findings provide a strong rationale for translating myostatin inhibition into clinical practice as an adjunctive strategy. Early clinical trials investigating myostatin inhibitors have shown favorable safety profiles and preliminary signs of target engagement. However, large-scale trials have yet to demonstrate widespread, robust efficacy across diverse patient populations. Despite this, myostatin pathway inhibition remains a compelling approach, particularly when integrated into broader treatment paradigms aimed at enhancing motor unit stability and function in individuals with SMA. Further clinical research is essential to validate efficacy, determine optimal timing, and define the patient subgroups most likely to benefit from myostatin-targeted therapies.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Martina Gnazzo; Giulia Pisanò; Valentina Baldini; Giovanna Giacomelli; Silvia Scullin; Benedetta Piccolo; Emanuela Claudia Turco; Susanna Esposito; Maria Carmela Pera,spinal muscular atrophy sma genetic disorder characterize progressive loss motor neuron consequent muscle atrophy smn target therapy significantly improve survival motor outcome residual muscle weakness remain major clinical challenge particularly patient treat later disease course myostatin potent negative regulator skeletal muscle mass emerge promising therapeutic target address gap review summarize preclinical clinical evidence support modulation myostatin pathway sma preclinical study demonstrate inhibit myostatin especially combine smn enhance agent increase muscle mass improve motor function enhance neuromuscular connectivity sma mouse model finding provide strong rationale translate myostatin inhibition clinical practice adjunctive strategy early clinical trial investigate myostatin inhibitor show favorable safety profile preliminary sign target engagement large scale trial demonstrate widespread robust efficacy diverse patient population despite myostatin pathway inhibition remain compelling approach particularly integrate broad treatment paradigm aim enhance motor unit stability function individual sma clinical research essential validate efficacy determine optimal timing define patient subgroup likely benefit myostatin target therapy
40565316,Twelve-Month CPAP Therapy Modulates BDNF Levels in Patients with Severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Implications for Metabolic and Treatment Compliance.,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and metabolic processes, including glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. In patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), recurrent episodes of intermittent hypoxia may stimulate BDNF expression as a compensatory neuroprotective response. OSA is associated with metabolic disturbances, such as increased insulin resistance and a higher risk of type 2 diabetes. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy may influence both BDNF levels and metabolic outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in BDNF concentration and glucose metabolism in patients with OSA, with particular emphasis on the effect of long-term CPAP therapy. Sixty-six adult patients with OSA confirmed by polysomnography were enrolled and divided into severe (s-OSA) and non-severe (ns-OSA) groups. Fasting blood samples were collected to measure glucose, insulin, and BDNF concentrations. Patients with s-OSA were re-evaluated after 12 months of CPAP therapy and further classified as compliant (sc-OSA) or non-compliant (snc-OSA) based on recorded device usage. The same biochemical parameters were assessed after the 12-month follow-up. Baseline BDNF levels were significantly higher in the s-OSA group compared to the ns-OSA group (20.1 ng/mL vs. 8.1 ng/mL, <i>p</i> = 0.02) and correlated with the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI, r = 0.38, <i>p</i> = 0.02). In the nsc-OSA group, BDNF concentrations increased significantly after 12 months (16.2 ng/mL vs. 35.5 ng/mL, <i>p</i> < 0.001), while no significant change was observed in the sc-OSA group (24.4 ng/mL vs. 27.4 ng/mL, <i>p</i> = 0.33). Among sc-OSA patients, a significant improvement in insulin resistance was noted, although no significant changes were observed in fasting glucose or insulin levels.

40565303,Brain Endothelial Cells in Blood-Brain Barrier Regulation and Neurological Therapy.,"Brain endothelial cells (BECs) constitute the core component of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), regulating substance exchange between blood and the brain parenchyma to maintain central nervous system homeostasis. In pathological states, the BBB exhibits the disruption of tight junctions, endothelial cell (EC) damage, and increased permeability, accompanied by neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and abnormal molecular signaling pathways, leading to neurotoxic effects in the brain parenchyma and exacerbating neurodegeneration and disease progression. This review systematically summarizes the developmental origin, structural characteristics, and pathological mechanisms of BECs in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and glioblastoma with a particular focus on the regulatory mechanisms of the Wnt/β-catenin and VEGF signaling pathways. By integrating the latest research advances, this review aims to provide a comprehensive perspective for understanding the role of BECs in physiological and pathological states and to provide a theoretical basis for the development of BBB-based therapeutic approaches for neurological diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Yuqing Xiang; Qiuxiang Gu; Dong Liu,brain endothelial cell becs constitute core component blood brain barrier bbb regulate substance exchange blood brain parenchyma maintain central nervous system homeostasis pathological state bbb exhibit disruption tight junction endothelial cell ec damage increase permeability accompany neuroinflammation oxidative stress abnormal molecular signal pathway lead neurotoxic effect brain parenchyma exacerbate neurodegeneration disease progression review systematically summarize developmental origin structural characteristic pathological mechanism bec disease alzheimer disease multiple sclerosis stroke glioblastoma particular focus regulatory mechanism wnt β catenin vegf signal pathway integrate late research advance review aim provide comprehensive perspective understand role bec physiological pathological state provide theoretical basis development bbb base therapeutic approach neurological disease
40565291,The Interplay Between Exosomes and Gut Microbiota in Neuroinflammation: A New Frontier in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition that is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β, the hyperphosphorylation of tau, and persistent neuroinflammation. However, these hallmarks alone do not fully capture the intricacies of AD pathology, thus necessitating the investigation of emerging mechanisms and innovative tools. Exosomes (nanoscale vesicles involved in cell communication and immune modulation) have emerged as pivotal cellular vehicles due to their dual role-both in the propagation of pathological proteins and the regulation of inflammatory responses. Furthermore, these vesicles have been demonstrated to play a crucial role in the mediation of the effects of microbiota-derived metabolites and the reflection of systemic influences such as dysbiosis, thereby establishing a link between the gut-brain axis and the progression of AD. A comprehensive narrative literature review was conducted using the following databases: ScienceDirect, Scopus, Wiley, Web of Science, Medline, and PubMed, covering studies published between 2015 and 2025. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were established to select research addressing exosomal biogenesis, their functional and diagnosis role, their therapeutic potential, and the emerging evidence on microbiota-exosome interplay in Alzheimer's disease. Exosomes have been identified as integral mediators of intercellular communication, reflecting the molecular state of the central nervous system. These particles have been shown to promote the propagation of pathological proteins, modulate neuroinflammatory responses, and serve as non-invasive biomarkers due to their detectability in peripheral fluids. Advances in exosomal engineering and microbiome-based interventions underscore the potential for targeting systemic and CNS-specific mechanisms to develop integrative therapies for AD. Exosomes present a promising approach for the early diagnosis and personalized treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

40565289,Dysregulation of Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatase OCRL in Alzheimer's Disease: Implications for Autophagy Dysfunction.,"Autophagy is impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly at the stage of autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Recent studies suggest that the inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase OCRL (Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome protein) is involved in this fusion process; however, its role in AD pathophysiology remains largely unclear. In this study, we investigated the localization and expression of OCRL in post-mortem AD brains and in a 5XFAD transgenic mouse model. While <i>OCRL</i> RNA levels were not significantly altered, OCRL protein was markedly reduced in the RIPA-soluble fraction and positively correlated with the autophagy marker Beclin1. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed OCRL immunoreactivity in neuronal cytoplasm, granulovacuolar degeneration bodies, and plaque-associated dystrophic neurites in AD brains. Furthermore, OCRL overexpression in a FRET-based tau biosensor cell model significantly reduced the tau-seeding-induced FRET signal. These findings suggest that OCRL dysregulation may contribute to autophagic deficits and the progression of tau pathology in AD.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Kunie Ando; May Thazin Htut; Eugenia Maria Antonelli; Andreea-Claudia Kosa; Lidia Lopez-Gutierrez; Carolina Quintanilla-Sánchez; Emmanuel Aydin; Emilie Doeraene; Siranjeevi Nagaraj; Ana Raquel Ramos; Katia Coulonval; Pierre P Roger; Jean-Pierre Brion; Karelle Leroy,autophagy impair alzheimer disease ad particularly stage autophagosome lysosome fusion recent study suggest inositol polyphosphate 5 phosphatase ocrl lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome protein involve fusion process role ad pathophysiology remain largely unclear study investigate localization expression ocrl post mortem ad brain 5xfad transgenic mouse model < > ocrl</i > rna level significantly alter ocrl protein markedly reduce ripa soluble fraction positively correlate autophagy marker beclin1 immunohistochemical analysis reveal ocrl immunoreactivity neuronal cytoplasm granulovacuolar degeneration body plaque associate dystrophic neurite ad brain furthermore ocrl overexpression fret base tau biosensor cell model significantly reduce tau seeding induce fret signal finding suggest ocrl dysregulation contribute autophagic deficit progression tau pathology ad
40565282,ApoE Isoform-Dependent Effects on Extinction of Contextual Fear Memory and Passive Avoidance Memory.,"Following exposure to trauma, avoidance behavior can be protective but also contribute to severe symptoms and interfere with exposure-based therapy. Extinction of fear conditioning by exposure to the same environment or environmental cues that were present during the initial traumatic event but without including the aversive stimulus or stimuli is often used to study post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a condition characterized by an inability to suppress conditioned fear responses. A limitation of this paradigm is that one cannot avoid the context or cues associated with the initial traumatic event. In contrast, in the passive avoidance test, one can escape the environment associated with the aversive stimulus. Genetic factors might modulate the ability to extinguish fear memory. In this study, we compared the effects of distinct human apoE isoforms on the extinction of contextual fear and passive avoidance memory, as well as on subsequent activity levels, depressive-like behavior, and hippocampal levels of tau, in targeted replacement mice.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Elizabeth Saltonstall; Alexandra Pederson; Abigail O'Niel; Sarah Holden; Kat Kessler; Eileen Ruth Samson Torres; Jacob Raber,follow exposure trauma avoidance behavior protective contribute severe symptom interfere exposure base therapy extinction fear conditioning exposure environment environmental cue present initial traumatic event include aversive stimulus stimulus study post traumatic stress disorder ptsd condition characterize inability suppress condition fear response limitation paradigm avoid context cue associate initial traumatic event contrast passive avoidance test escape environment associate aversive stimulus genetic factor modulate ability extinguish fear memory study compare effect distinct human apoe isoform extinction contextual fear passive avoidance memory subsequent activity level depressive like behavior hippocampal level tau target replacement mouse
40565278,The Complex Etiology of Epilepsy: Genetic Analysis and HLA Association in Patients in the Middle East.,"Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders. Disease etiology and pathogenesis are still not well understood. Genetic mutations are associated with 70% of epilepsies, while 30% are still enigmatic. Attempting to close the knowledge gap, we performed genetic analysis of a cohort of patients from the Middle East and North Africa, both understudied and highly consanguineous populations. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was carried out on 81 patients and their family members at a tertiary center in Qatar. We found damaging mutations in half of the patients: 15 in known epilepsy genes, and 19 in contested or unknown genes. The mutations include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNVs), frameshifts, copy number variations (CNVs), and loss of homozygosity (LOH). Fifteen of the SNVs are novel, and seventeen are homozygous, reflective of the characteristics of the cohort. In addition, we used the WES data to type HLA alleles for 13 class I and II genes. We show that <i>DRB3*01:01:02G</i> is negatively associated with epilepsy, in contrast to <i>DRB4*01:01:01G</i>, which may be a risk allele.

40565268,Pathological Alterations in Human Blood Microbiome-An Updated Review.,"The main source of microorganisms in the blood is the intestinal and oral microflora through the route of atopobiosis. It is clear that the blood microbiome undergoes significant changes in response to various pathological conditions within the human body. In this review, we summarized data from studies of the human blood microbiome in diseases of the nervous system and cardiovascular, respiratory, liver, kidney, and metabolite disorders. Links between the blood microbiome and the above mentioned diseases are demonstrated. In support of this understanding, it is evident that analogous alterations in microbiome composition occur across various disease categories; however, the microbial signatures associated with the blood microbiome exhibit specificity. For instance, an elevated abundancy of <i>Proteobacteria</i> has been identified in cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic disorders. Conversely, while <i>Firmicutes</i> are found to be abundant in renal and metabolic conditions, their levels are diminished in cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, patients suffering from respiratory and liver ailments typically show a heightened presence of <i>Bacteroidetes</i>; notably, <i>Flavobacterium</i> is prevalent in respiratory diseases, whereas <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> is associated with liver diseases. Hence, the human blood microbiome could be considered as a potential biomarker in certain diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Stela Dragomanova; Reni Kalfin; Lyubka Tancheva; Sidharth Mehan; Dana Stanciu; Stefan Panaiotov,main source microorganism blood intestinal oral microflora route atopobiosis clear blood microbiome undergo significant change response pathological condition human body review summarize datum study human blood microbiome disease nervous system cardiovascular respiratory liver kidney metabolite disorder link blood microbiome mention disease demonstrate support understanding evident analogous alteration microbiome composition occur disease category microbial signature associate blood microbiome exhibit specificity instance elevated abundancy < > proteobacteria</i > identify cardiovascular renal metabolic disorder conversely < > firmicutes</i > find abundant renal metabolic condition level diminish cardiovascular disease additionally patient suffer respiratory liver ailment typically heighten presence < > bacteroidetes</i > notably < > flavobacterium</i > prevalent respiratory disease < > enterobacteriaceae</i > associate liver disease human blood microbiome consider potential biomarker certain disease
40565265,Candidate Key Proteins of Tinnitus in the Auditory and Motor Systems of the Thalamus.,"To determine candidate key proteins involved in synaptic transmission in the thalamus in tinnitus, we used bioinformatic methods by analyzing protein-protein interaction networks under different conditions of acoustic activity. The motor system was used to analyze the specificity of the response reaction in the auditory system. The databases GeneCard, STRING-, DAVID-, and Cytoscape version 3.9.1 were applied to identify the top three high-degree proteins, their high-score interaction proteins and the gene ontology-biological processes (GO-BPs) associated in the thalamus with synaptic transmission in tinnitus. Under normal hearing conditions, a balanced state of functional connectivity was observed for both systems, the auditory system and the motor system of the thalamus. Under conditions of acoustic stimulation, the GO-BP-enrichment analyses suggest that in the auditory system, tinnitus-related proteins may be involved in responses typically associated with ""xenobiotic stimuli""; in the motor system, the activation of the dopaminergic system was observed. Under conditions of tinnitus in the auditory system, key proteins and the GO-BPs indicate the regulation of different developmental processes and regulation by microRNA transcription; in the motor system, tinnitus is also identified as ""xenobiotic"" but responded with GO-BPs, corresponding to various signaling systems, e.g., tachykinin. Key proteins and their interactions with neurotransmitter receptors may be useful indicators for tinnitus-associated changes in synaptic transmission in the thalamic auditory system.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Johann Gross; Marlies Knipper; Birgit Mazurek,determine candidate key protein involve synaptic transmission thalamus tinnitus bioinformatic method analyze protein protein interaction network different condition acoustic activity motor system analyze specificity response reaction auditory system database genecard string- david- cytoscape version 3.9.1 apply identify high degree protein high score interaction protein gene ontology biological process bps associate thalamus synaptic transmission tinnitus normal hearing condition balanced state functional connectivity observe system auditory system motor system thalamus condition acoustic stimulation bp enrichment analysis suggest auditory system tinnitus relate protein involve response typically associate xenobiotic stimulus motor system activation dopaminergic system observe condition tinnitus auditory system key protein bps indicate regulation different developmental process regulation microrna transcription motor system tinnitus identify xenobiotic respond bps correspond signal system e.g. tachykinin key protein interaction neurotransmitter receptor useful indicator tinnitus associate change synaptic transmission thalamic auditory system
40565264,Bioinformatics-Driven Multi-Factorial Insight into α-Galactosidase Mutations.,"Fabry disease is a rare genetic disorder caused by deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (AGAL), resulting in the accumulation of globotriaosylceramides (Gb3) in tissues and organs. This buildup leads to progressive, multi-systemic complications that severely impact quality of life and can be life-threatening. Interpreting the functional consequences of missense variants in the <i>GLA</i> gene remains a significant challenge, especially in rare diseases where experimental evidence is scarce. In this study, we present an integrative computational framework that combines structural, interaction, pathogenicity, and stability data from both in silico tools and experimental sources, enriched through expert curation and structural analysis. Given the clinical relevance of pharmacological chaperones in Fabry disease, we focus in particular on the structural characteristics of variants classified as ""amenable"" to such treatments. Our multidimensional analysis-using tools such as AlphaMissense, EVE, FoldX, and ChimeraX-identifies key molecular features that distinguish amenable from non-amenable variants. We find that amenable mutations tend to preserve protein stability, while non-amenable ones are associated with structural destabilisation. By comparing AlphaMissense with alternative predictors rooted in evolutionary (EVE) and thermodynamic (FoldX) models, we explore the relative contribution of different biological paradigms to variant classification. Additionally, the investigation of outlier variants-where AlphaMissense predictions diverge from clinical annotations-highlights candidates for further experimental validation. These findings demonstrate how combining structural bioinformatics with machine learning-based predictions can improve missense variant interpretation and support precision medicine in rare genetic disorders.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Bruno Hay Mele; Federica Rossetti; Giuseppina Andreotti; Maria Vittoria Cubellis; Simone Guerriero; Maria Monticelli,fabry disease rare genetic disorder cause deficient activity lysosomal enzyme alpha galactosidase agal result accumulation globotriaosylceramide gb3 tissue organ buildup lead progressive multi systemic complication severely impact quality life life threatening interpret functional consequence missense variant < > gla</i > gene remain significant challenge especially rare disease experimental evidence scarce study present integrative computational framework combine structural interaction pathogenicity stability datum silico tool experimental source enrich expert curation structural analysis give clinical relevance pharmacological chaperones fabry disease focus particular structural characteristic variant classify amenable treatment multidimensional analysis tool alphamissense eve foldx chimerax identifie key molecular feature distinguish amenable non amenable variant find amenable mutation tend preserve protein stability non amenable one associate structural destabilisation compare alphamissense alternative predictor root evolutionary eve thermodynamic foldx model explore relative contribution different biological paradigm variant classification additionally investigation outli variant alphamissense prediction diverge clinical annotation highlight candidate experimental validation finding demonstrate combine structural bioinformatic machine learning base prediction improve missense variant interpretation support precision medicine rare genetic disorder
40565245,Oxidative Stress in Neurodegenerative Disorders: A Key Driver in Impairing Skeletal Muscle Health.,"The fine regulation of antioxidant systems and intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is responsible for cellular redox balance. The main organelles responsible for ROS production are mitochondria, and they complete this process through the electron transport chain. These potentially harmful molecules are buffered by enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems. Oxidative stress is determined by an imbalance between the production and clearance of ROS in favor of the accumulation of these detrimental species, which generate cellular damage by interacting with macromolecules. In neurodegenerative diseases, oxidative stress has been demonstrated to be a crucial component, both causal and consequential to the disease itself. On the other hand, neurodegeneration disrupts neuromuscular junctions, leading to reduced muscle use and subsequent atrophy. Additionally, systemic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction associated with neurodegenerative diseases exacerbate muscle degeneration. Thus, sarcopenia and atrophy are common consequences of neurodegeneration and play a significant role in these disorders. Regarding this, ROS have been defined as promoting sarcopenia, stimulating the expression of genes typical of this condition. Overall, this review aims to contribute to filling the gap in the literature regarding the consequences at the muscular level of the relationship between oxidative stress and neurodegenerative diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Serena Castelli; Emily Carinci; Sara Baldelli,fine regulation antioxidant system intracellular production reactive oxygen species ros responsible cellular redox balance main organelle responsible ros production mitochondria complete process electron transport chain potentially harmful molecule buffer enzymatic non enzymatic antioxidant system oxidative stress determine imbalance production clearance ros favor accumulation detrimental specie generate cellular damage interact macromolecule neurodegenerative disease oxidative stress demonstrate crucial component causal consequential disease hand neurodegeneration disrupt neuromuscular junction lead reduce muscle use subsequent atrophy additionally systemic inflammation metabolic dysfunction associate neurodegenerative disease exacerbate muscle degeneration sarcopenia atrophy common consequence neurodegeneration play significant role disorder ros define promote sarcopenia stimulate expression gene typical condition overall review aim contribute fill gap literature consequence muscular level relationship oxidative stress neurodegenerative disease
40565243,Exploration of Bromodomain Proteins as Drug Targets for Niemann-Pick Type C Disease.,"Defects in lysosomal cholesterol handling provoke fatal disorders presenting neurovisceral symptoms with variable onset and life spans. A prime example is Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPCD), where cholesterol export from the endosomal-lysosomal system is impaired due to variants of either NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 1 (NPC1) or NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 2 (NPC2). Therapeutic options for NPCD are limited to palliative care and disease-modifying drugs, and there is a need for new treatments. Here, we explored bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins as new drug targets for NPCD using patient-derived skin fibroblasts. Treatment with JQ1, a prototype BET protein inhibitor, raised the level of NPC1 protein, diminished lysosomal expansion and cholesterol accumulation, and induced extracellular release of lysosomal components in a dose-, time-, and patient-dependent manner. Lastly, JQ1 enhanced and reduced cholesterol accumulation induced by pharmacologic inhibition of NPC1 and of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, respectively. Taken together, bromodomain proteins should be further explored as therapeutic drug targets for lysosomal diseases like NPCD, and as new components regulating lysosomal function and cholesterol metabolism.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Martina Parente; Amélie Barthelemy; Claudia Tonini; Sara Caputo; Alessandra Sacchi; Stefano Leone; Marco Segatto; Frank W Pfrieger; Valentina Pallottini,defect lysosomal cholesterol handle provoke fatal disorder present neurovisceral symptom variable onset life span prime example niemann pick type c disease npcd cholesterol export endosomal lysosomal system impair variant npc intracellular cholesterol transporter 1 npc1 npc intracellular cholesterol transporter 2 npc2 therapeutic option npcd limit palliative care disease modify drug need new treatment explore bromodomain extra terminal domain bet protein new drug target npcd patient derive skin fibroblast treatment jq1 prototype bet protein inhibitor raise level npc1 protein diminish lysosomal expansion cholesterol accumulation induce extracellular release lysosomal component dose- time- patient dependent manner lastly jq1 enhance reduce cholesterol accumulation induce pharmacologic inhibition npc1 histone deacetylase hdac activity respectively take bromodomain protein explore therapeutic drug target lysosomal disease like npcd new component regulate lysosomal function cholesterol metabolism
40565238,"Ex Vivo Osteoclastogenesis from Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells Is Unchanged in Adults with Phenylketonuria, Regardless of Dietary Compliance.","Pathogenic variants in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene can result in phenylalanine (Phe) accumulation leading to phenylketonuria (PKU; OMIM #261600), a metabolic disease diagnosed in newborn screening. Early treatment with a Phe-restricted diet prevents severe mental retardation. Next to several other health complaints, patients with PKU present with low bone mineral density (BMD) more often than the general population. The etiology of the phenotype is not yet fully understood, and current research focuses on improving special medical foods and changes in osteoclasts (OC) and osteoblasts. Analysis of osteoclastic and oxidative stress control gene expression next to the simple number of OC developing from peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs) in association with dietary compliance and BMD was therefore part of our analysis. PBMCs were obtained from 17 adults with PKU and 17 age- and sex-matched controls on the same day. PBMCs were differentiated into osteoclasts (OC, Trap-positive multi-nucleated cells (≥3 nuclei)) for 14 days by adding human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF) and receptor activator of NF-κB Ligand (RANKL). Subsequently, quantitative real-time PCR was performed on OC function and oxidative stress control. Data on dietary compliance during the previous 12 months and 5 years and BMD were collected. PBMCs from adults with PKU and controls were differentiated into comparable numbers of OC (PKU: 53 [17-87] vs. controls: 39 [19-52], <i>p</i> = 0.381) without differences in mRNA expression of genes related to OC function and oxidative stress control. Dietary compliance in short-term and mid-term was not associated with OC number or mRNA expression, but <i>CTSK</i> negatively correlated with BMD T-Score in the hips of adults with PKU (Spearman r = -0.518, <i>p</i> = 0.040). Osteoclastogenesis was not changed in adult patients with PKU, nor were most mRNA expressions of OC marker genes or those of oxidative stress control. However, 44% of patients presented with BMD below -1 in their hips, and the OC of these tended to express higher <i>CTSK</i> (above -1: 0.2 [0.2-0.8] vs. below -1: 0.9 [0.6-3.4], <i>p</i> = 0.055).

40565209,Quercetin as a Therapeutic Option in a Rat Model of Aluminum Chloride- and D-Galactose-Induced Neurodegeneration.,"Aluminum (Al) is one of the most abundant metals on Earth and is well known as an environmental neurotoxic agent in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Aluminum toxicity is associated with oxidative stress, reduction of antioxidant enzymes, and disruption of the balance of cellular metals, such as iron (Fe), calcium (Ca), and copper (Cu), which causes structural and functional changes in the nervous tissue of the brain or peripheral nervous system. The intake of functional foods, rich in antioxidants, such as quercetin, may be beneficial in combating oxidative stress and neurodegenerative changes in the brain. The aim of this study was to provide deeper insight into the cellular and molecular neuroprotective effects of quercetin in regulating amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation, tau pathology, and neuroinflammation in the Al/D-galactose-induced rat model (Al/D-gal) of AD. The results showed that quercetin successfully modulated the impaired homeostatic and neuropathological consequences of aluminum chloride and D-galactose administration over 28 days: it directly protected neurons by regulating the level of oxidative stress and antioxidants, reduced Aβ aggregation by inhibiting the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), increased the survival, growth, and differentiation of nerve cells by maintaining the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and regulated microglial immunoreactivity and neuroinflammation by reducing the level of proinflammatory cytokines.

40565203,Luteolin Potentially Alleviates Methamphetamine Withdrawal-Induced Negative Emotions and Cognitive Deficits Through the AKT/FOXO1/HO-1 Signaling Pathway in the Prefrontal Cortex and Caudate Putamen.,"Methamphetamine (METH) misuse-induced affective and cognitive dysfunctions cause severe global health and economic burdens. However, the mechanisms underlying METH withdrawal-induced negative emotions and cognitive deficits, as well as the treatment strategies for them, remain elusive. Previous findings suggest that METH use triggers neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis, and protein kinase B (AKT), forkhead box protein 1 (FOXO1), and heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) are implicated in these processes. In the present study, we aimed to reveal the role and potential mechanisms of luteolin, a flavonoid phytochemical with anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties, in METH withdrawal-induced negative emotions and cognitive deficits. We found that prolonged METH withdrawal led to an increase in neuronal activity and a decrease in the protein expression of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) and HO-1 in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and caudate putamen (CPu). Luteolin pretreatment partially mitigated these METH withdrawal-induced negative emotions and cognitive deficits, and prevented the abnormal activation of PFC and CPu as well as the downregulation of AKT/HO-1 expression. Notably, we further observed that luteolin inhibited the METH-induced nuclear translocation of FOXO1. Our findings suggest that luteolin may alleviate METH withdrawal-induced affective and cognitive dysfunctions by reducing oxidative injury in the brain through the AKT/FOXO1/HO-1 pathway, highlighting its potential for treating drug addiction-related health issues.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Baoyao Gao; Ran An; Min Liang; Xinglin Wang; Jianhang Peng; Xingyao Chen; Zijun Liu; Tao Li; Xinshe Liu; Jianbo Zhang; Wei Han,methamphetamine meth misuse induce affective cognitive dysfunction cause severe global health economic burden mechanism underlie meth withdrawal induce negative emotion cognitive deficit treatment strategy remain elusive previous finding suggest meth use trigger neuroinflammation neuronal apoptosis protein kinase b akt forkhead box protein 1 foxo1 heme oxygenase-1 ho-1 implicate process present study aim reveal role potential mechanism luteolin flavonoid phytochemical anti inflammatory antioxidative property meth withdrawal induce negative emotion cognitive deficit find prolong meth withdrawal lead increase neuronal activity decrease protein expression phosphorylate akt p akt ho-1 prefrontal cortex pfc caudate putaman cpu luteolin pretreatment partially mitigate meth withdrawal induce negative emotion cognitive deficit prevent abnormal activation pfc cpu downregulation akt ho-1 expression notably observe luteolin inhibit meth induce nuclear translocation foxo1 finding suggest luteolin alleviate meth withdrawal induce affective cognitive dysfunction reduce oxidative injury brain akt foxo1 ho-1 pathway highlight potential treat drug addiction relate health issue

This study compared the cognitive and pathological effects of propofol and remimazolam in a mouse model with AD following surgery. Five-month-old male ApoE4-KI mice underwent abdominal surgery under either propofol (170 mg/kg) or remimazolam (85 mg/kg) anesthesia. Cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze and Y-maze, and neuronal apoptosis and amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition in the CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus were evaluated preoperatively and at 2, 4, and 7 days postoperatively. Both groups showed similar postoperative cognitive functions, with increased relative escape latency at day 2 and decreased relative spontaneous alternation at days 4 and 7. However, the neuropathological analysis revealed that propofol-induced significantly more neuronal death in the CA3 (days 4 and 7) and DG (days 2, 4, and 7), and greater Aβ accumulation in the CA3 (days 2 and 4) and DG (days 2 and 7) compared to remimazolam (<i>p</i> < 0.05).

40565161,Metabolic and Inflammatory Biomarkers Predicting Sarcopenic Obesity and Cardiometabolic Risk in Arab Women: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"The sarcopenic obesity-related phenotype (SOP) is defined by the coexistence of sarcopenia and obesity, leading to heightened disability, morbidity, and mortality. Its multifactorial pathogenesis involves chronic inflammation and metabolic alterations. In this cross-sectional study, 562 women were classified into four groups: control, sarcopenic, obese, and SOP. Body composition measurements, including fat mass, skeletal muscle mass, and extracellular water (ECW), were assessed using the bioimpedance method. Several inflammatory biomarkers were measured in plasma samples by ELISA. Discriminant function analysis identified age, ECW, chemerin, the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), and the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TC/HDL-C) as significant discriminators among groups, clearly distinguishing SOP from control. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that these variables were independently associated with SOP status (SOP vs. control), regardless of age, with odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.87 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23-2.85) for SII to 7.77 (95% CI: 3.67-16.44) for ECW. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) analysis further demonstrated that SOP significantly increased the odds (OR: 3.04; 95% CI: 1.39-6.67) of multimorbidity (hypertension (HTN) + hyperlipidemia (HLD) + type 2 diabetes (D2T)). These findings suggest SOP is a clinically relevant phenotype linked to cardiometabolic comorbidities and systemic inflammation.

Cerebral ischemia causes a rapid elevation of adenosine, the main neuromodulator in the brain. The inhibition of adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs) has been introduced as a potential target in neurodegenerative disorders involving extracellular adenosine elevation. Istradefylline, a selective A2AR antagonist, has been approved for Parkinson's disease (PD) adjunctive therapy and showed neuroprotective effects in PD and Alzheimer's disease. However, the role of A2ARs in post-stroke neuronal damage and behavioral deficits remains unclear. We recently showed that A2AR antagonism prevented the adenosine-induced post-hypoxia synaptic potentiation of glutamatergic neurotransmission following the hypoxia/reperfusion of hippocampal slices. Here, we investigated the potential neuroprotective effects of istradefylline in male <i>Sprague-Dawley</i> rats subjected to pial vessel disruption (PVD) used to model a small-vessel stroke. Rats were treated with either a vehicle control or istradefylline (3 mg/kg i.p.) following PVD surgery for three days. Istradefylline administration prevented anxiety and depressive-like behaviors caused by PVD stroke. In addition, istradefylline significantly attenuated ischemia-induced cognitive impairment and motor deficits. Moreover, istradefylline markedly reduced hippocampal neurodegeneration, as well as GFAP/Iba-1, TNF-α, nNOS, and iNOS levels after PVD, but prevented the downregulation of anti-inflammatory markers TGF-β1 and IL-4. Together, these results suggest a molecular link between stroke and PD and that the anti-PD drug istradefylline displays translational potential for drug repurposing as a neuroprotective agent for cerebral ischemic damage.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Michael G Zaki; Elisabet Jakova; Mahboubeh Pordeli; Elina Setork; Changiz Taghibiglou; Francisco S Cayabyab,stroke lead cause death worldwide major cause functional disability cerebral ischemia cause rapid elevation adenosine main neuromodulator brain inhibition adenosine a2a receptor a2ars introduce potential target neurodegenerative disorder involve extracellular adenosine elevation istradefylline selective a2ar antagonist approve parkinson disease pd adjunctive therapy show neuroprotective effect pd alzheimer disease role a2ars post stroke neuronal damage behavioral deficit remain unclear recently show a2ar antagonism prevent adenosine induce post hypoxia synaptic potentiation glutamatergic neurotransmission follow hypoxia reperfusion hippocampal slice investigate potential neuroprotective effect istradefylline male < > sprague dawley</i > rat subject pial vessel disruption pvd model small vessel stroke rat treat vehicle control istradefylline 3 mg kg i.p follow pvd surgery day istradefylline administration prevent anxiety depressive like behavior cause pvd stroke addition istradefylline significantly attenuate ischemia induce cognitive impairment motor deficit istradefylline markedly reduce hippocampal neurodegeneration gfap iba-1 tnf α nnos inos level pvd prevent downregulation anti inflammatory marker tgf β1 il-4 result suggest molecular link stroke pd anti pd drug istradefylline display translational potential drug repurpose neuroprotective agent cerebral ischemic damage

40565132,Effects of Phenosanic Acid in Rat Seizure Models.,"Oxidative stress and membrane damage are believed to be principally involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. This study aimed to assess the effects of phenosanic acid (PA), an antioxidant and membrane protector, in acute pentylenetetrazole and chronic lithium-pilocarpine seizure models in male Wistar rats. PA was administered acutely (ip, 120 mg/kg BW ip, or 240 mg/kg BW per os) or chronically (80 mg/kg BW/day per os). Indices of free radical oxidation, the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, and the nitrergic system were assessed in blood and brain regions. Morphological analysis of the hippocampus was performed in the lithium-pilocarpine model. PA exerted an acute anti-seizure effect in the pentylenetetrazole model. In the lithium-pilocarpine model, acute PA treatment decreased the death rate and corticosterone levels in the neocortex and brainstem. In contrast, the level of free radical oxidation products reacting with thiobarbituric acid declined in the brain stem in response to chronic PA treatment. In the lithium-pilocarpine model, the neuronal density in the dentate gyrus was elevated, and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen positive (PCNA+) cell counts in the subgranular zone did not differ between groups. Doublecortin positive (DCX+) cell count was significantly increased after chronic PA treatment. PA-induced reduction in mortality in the lithium-pilocarpine epilepsy model may be partially mediated by decreasing the lipid peroxidation and corticosterone levels in different brain regions. Chronic PA treatment may affect adult hippocampal neurogenesis by either prolonging the action of factors that increase neurogenesis after status epilepticus or by slowing down the neuronal differentiation rate. These data suggest that PA may be a disease-modifying AED able to hamper epileptogenesis.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Victor A Aniol; Natalia A Lazareva; Yulia V Moiseeva; Olga A Nedogreeva; Margarita R Novikova; Pavel A Kostryukov; Mikhail V Onufriev; Natalia V Gulyaeva,oxidative stress membrane damage believe principally involve pathogenesis epilepsy study aim assess effect phenosanic acid pa antioxidant membrane protector acute pentylenetetrazole chronic lithium pilocarpine seizure model male wistar rat pa administer acutely ip 120 mg kg bw ip 240 mg kg bw os chronically 80 mg kg bw day os index free radical oxidation hypothalamo pituitary adrenocortical axis nitrergic system assess blood brain region morphological analysis hippocampus perform lithium pilocarpine model pa exert acute anti seizure effect pentylenetetrazole model lithium pilocarpine model acute pa treatment decrease death rate corticosterone level neocortex brainstem contrast level free radical oxidation product react thiobarbituric acid decline brain stem response chronic pa treatment lithium pilocarpine model neuronal density dentate gyrus elevate proliferate cell nuclear antigen positive pcna+ cell count subgranular zone differ group doublecortin positive dcx+ cell count significantly increase chronic pa treatment pa induce reduction mortality lithium pilocarpine epilepsy model partially mediate decrease lipid peroxidation corticosterone level different brain region chronic pa treatment affect adult hippocampal neurogenesis prolong action factor increase neurogenesis status epilepticus slow neuronal differentiation rate datum suggest pa disease modify aed able hamper epileptogenesis

In this study, we examined the relationship between neuroinflammation and three specific biomarkers-matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9, the inflammasome NLRP3, and the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA-in connection with PTSD symptoms assessed using the PTSD Symptom Scale-Interview for DSM-5 (PSSI-5). The symptoms were categorized into the following domains: re-experiencing, avoidance, alterations in cognition and mood, increased arousal and reactivity, distress and functional impairment, symptom onset and duration, and the total symptom score. Our findings confirmed the pro-inflammatory roles of MMP-2, MMP-9, and the inflammasome NLRP3, as well as the anti-inflammatory, calming effect of GABA. We identified strong correlations between biomarkers, particularly between MMP-2 and MMP-9, MMP-2 and NLRP3, and MMP-2 and GABA, highlighting a closely interconnected inflammatory response. Among the PSSI-5 domains, re-experiencing, increased arousal and reactivity, and distress and functional impairment showed the strongest associations with the total symptom score.

40565120,Dementia and Sleep Disorders: The Effects of Drug Therapy in a Systematic Review.,"Currently, approximately 40% of patients with dementia develop some form of sleep disorder. Benzodiazepines are widely prescribed but pose the risk of tolerance and cognitive decline; however, Z-drugs may offer safer alternatives. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to analyze the effect of benzodiazepines and Z-drugs on sleep disorders in patients with dementia. Two authors conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Espistemonikos, and ACCESSSS for studies published between 2019 and 2024 using the MeSH terms ""dementia"", ""sleep disorders"", and ""pharmacotherapy"". Randomized clinical trials comparing benzodiazepines, Z-drugs, or innovative medications with placebo or other drugs were included. Sleep and cognitive outcomes were assessed using validated instruments; the ROB-2 tool evaluated the risk of bias. The protocol was registered in ""PROSPERO"". Three randomized clinical trials involving a total of 192 patients were included in the review. Zopiclone increased the main duration of nighttime sleep by 81 min, Zolpidem reduced nighttime awakenings by 21 min, and Eszopiclone improved sleep quality, benefited the progression of sleep architecture, and reduced mental symptoms such as fear and anxiety.

40565114,CEST MRI in the Management/Diagnosis of Neuroinfectious Diseases.,"Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI is a novel technique that allows for the specific imaging of certain molecules that contain exchangeable protons. Neuroimaging is a major contributor to diagnosing and monitoring infections of the central nervous system (CNS). This review focuses on summarizing the current literature surrounding the use of CEST MRI imaging in diagnosing, monitoring, and treating CNS infections. BacCEST is a new technique to detect bacterial infection in organs at profound levels. This technique allows for the specific pathogen causing the infection to be understood, allowing for tailored antibiotic therapies. The bacCEST signal is also directly proportional to the number of bacterial cells; this means it can be used over periods to track response to treatment via cell numbers. The results show that most of the research in this area has focused on infections of the brain parenchyma (e.g., encephalitis) and that most studies investigate the use of CEST in animal models, with a minority exploring the application of CEST to human participants.

40565107,Targeted DNA Methylation Using Modified DNA Probes: A Potential Therapeutic Tool for Depression and Stress-Related Disorders.,"Epigenetic modifications play a crucial role in gene regulation and have been implicated in various physiological processes and disease conditions. DNA methylation (DNAm) has been implicated in the etiology and progression of many stress-related psychiatric behaviors, such as depression. The ability to manipulate DNAm may provide a means to reverse and treat such disorders. Although CRISPR-based technologies have enabled locus-specific DNAm editing, their clinical applicability may be limited due to immunogenicity concerns and off-target effects. In this study, we introduce a novel approach for targeted DNAm manipulation using single-stranded methylated DNA probes. The probes were designed against the GRE of FKBP5 and the promoter region of MAOA. In both human embryonic kidney HEK293 and mouse pituitary AtT-20 cells, transfection with their respective methylated probes significantly increased DNAm at targeted CpG sites in a persistent and dose-dependent manner. Importantly, the induced methylation effectively attenuated glucocorticoid-induced upregulation of FKBP5 gene expression. Alteration of methylation was specific to single-stranded probes, as double-stranded methylated probes and unmethylated probes showed no significant effects. Some limitations include the need to further characterize factors that influence probe efficiency, such as probe length and CpG density; develop an efficient in vivo probe delivery system; and perform a more extensive consideration of possible off-target effects. Despite these limitations, our findings suggest that methylated DNA probes have the potential to function as a simple tool for targeted epigenetic manipulation and serve as a safer alternative to CRISPR-based epigenome editing tools for the treatment of stress-related disorders such as depression.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Nishtaa Modi; Jeffrey Guo; Ryan A Lee; Alisha Greenstein; Richard S Lee,epigenetic modification play crucial role gene regulation implicate physiological process disease condition dna methylation dnam implicate etiology progression stress relate psychiatric behavior depression ability manipulate dnam provide means reverse treat disorder crispr base technology enable locus specific dnam editing clinical applicability limit immunogenicity concern target effect study introduce novel approach target dnam manipulation single strand methylated dna probe probe design gre fkbp5 promoter region maoa human embryonic kidney hek293 mouse pituitary att-20 cell transfection respective methylate probe significantly increase dnam target cpg site persistent dose dependent manner importantly induced methylation effectively attenuate glucocorticoid induce upregulation fkbp5 gene expression alteration methylation specific single strand probe double stranded methylate probe unmethylated probe show significant effect limitation include need characterize factor influence probe efficiency probe length cpg density develop efficient vivo probe delivery system perform extensive consideration possible target effect despite limitation finding suggest methylate dna probe potential function simple tool target epigenetic manipulation serve safe alternative crispr base epigenome editing tool treatment stress relate disorder depression
40565099,Epigenetic Alterations in Glioblastoma Multiforme as Novel Therapeutic Targets: A Scoping Review.,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive primary brain tumor with a dismal prognosis despite advances in multimodal treatment. Conventional therapies fail to achieve durable responses due to GBM's molecular heterogeneity and capacity to evade therapeutic pressures. Epigenetic alterations have emerged as critical contributors to GBM pathobiology, including aberrant DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA (ncRNA) dysregulation. These mechanisms drive oncogenesis, therapy resistance, and immune evasion. This scoping review evaluates the current state of knowledge on epigenetic modifications in GBM, synthesizing findings from original articles and preclinical and clinical trials published over the last decade. Particular attention is given to MGMT promoter hypermethylation status as a biomarker for temozolomide (TMZ) sensitivity, histone deacetylation and methylation as modulators of chromatin structure, and microRNAs as regulators of pathways such as apoptosis and angiogenesis. Therapeutically, epigenetic drugs, like DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), appear as promising approaches in preclinical models and early trials. Emerging RNA-based therapies targeting dysregulated ncRNAs represent a novel approach to reprogram the tumor epigenome. Combination therapies, pairing epigenetic agents with immune checkpoint inhibitors or chemotherapy, are explored for their potential to enhance treatment response. Despite these advancements, challenges such as tumor heterogeneity, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and off-target effects remain significant. Future directions emphasize integrative omics approaches to identify patient-specific targets and refine therapies. This article thus highlights the potential of epigenetics in reshaping GBM treatment paradigms.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Marco Meleiro; Rui Henrique,glioblastoma multiforme gbm highly aggressive primary brain tumor dismal prognosis despite advance multimodal treatment conventional therapy fail achieve durable response gbm molecular heterogeneity capacity evade therapeutic pressure epigenetic alteration emerge critical contributor gbm pathobiology include aberrant dna methylation histone modification non coding rna ncrna dysregulation mechanism drive oncogenesis therapy resistance immune evasion scope review evaluate current state knowledge epigenetic modification gbm synthesize finding original article preclinical clinical trial publish decade particular attention give mgmt promoter hypermethylation status biomarker temozolomide tmz sensitivity histone deacetylation methylation modulator chromatin structure micrornas regulator pathway apoptosis angiogenesis therapeutically epigenetic drug like dna methyltransferase inhibitor dnmtis histone deacetylase inhibitor hdacis appear promising approach preclinical model early trial emerge rna base therapy target dysregulate ncrnas represent novel approach reprogram tumor epigenome combination therapy pair epigenetic agent immune checkpoint inhibitor chemotherapy explore potential enhance treatment response despite advancement challenge tumor heterogeneity blood brain barrier bbb target effect remain significant future direction emphasize integrative omic approach identify patient specific target refine therapy article highlight potential epigenetic reshape gbm treatment paradigm
40565097,Apocynin Mitigates Diabetic Muscle Atrophy by Lowering Muscle Triglycerides and Oxidative Stress.,"Diabetic muscular atrophy is a complication of diabetes mellitus that can decrease quality of life. Its complex mechanisms include alterations in proteolytic pathways, oxidative stress, and intracellular lipid accumulation. NADPH oxidase enzymes (NOX) play a key role in the production of ROS, contributing to oxidative damage and insulin resistance. Apocynin, a NOX inhibitor, has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, suggesting its therapeutic potential in various diabetic complications. This study evaluated the impact of apocynin on the mechanisms of muscle atrophy in slow- and fast-twitch muscles of diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats by intraperitoneal injection of a single dose of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg). Apocynin treatment (3 mg/kg/day) was administered for 8 weeks. Fasting blood glucose levels, lipid profile, and weight gain were measured. Both slow-twitch (soleus) and fast-twitch (extensor digitorum longus, EDL) skeletal muscles were weighed and used to assess triglycerides (TG) content, histological analysis, lipid peroxidation levels, and gene expression evaluated by qRT-PCR. Apocynin reduced blood glucose levels, improved body weight, and exhibited hypolipidemic effects. It significantly increased muscle weight in EDL and soleus, especially in EDL muscle, lowering triglycerides, lipid peroxidation, and increasing fiber size. Additionally, it decreased mRNA expression levels of MuRF-1, atrogin-1, myostatin and p47phox mRNA and upregulated PGC-1α and follistatin mRNA. Apocynin exerted a myoprotective effect by mitigating muscle atrophy in diabetic rats. Its effects were differentially mediated on TG accumulation and muscle fiber size, reducing oxidative stress, atrogene expression, and positively regulating PGC-1α.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Sarai Sánchez-Duarte; Elizabeth Sánchez-Duarte; Luis A Sánchez-Briones; Esperanza Meléndez-Herrera; Ma Antonia Herrera-Vargas; Sergio Márquez-Gamiño; Karla S Vera-Delgado; Rocío Montoya-Pérez,diabetic muscular atrophy complication diabetes mellitus decrease quality life complex mechanism include alteration proteolytic pathway oxidative stress intracellular lipid accumulation nadph oxidase enzyme nox play key role production ros contribute oxidative damage insulin resistance apocynin nox inhibitor antioxidant anti inflammatory effect suggest therapeutic potential diabetic complication study evaluate impact apocynin mechanism muscle atrophy slow- fast twitch muscle diabetic rat diabetes induce male wistar rat intraperitoneal injection single dose streptozotocin 60 mg kg apocynin treatment 3 mg kg day administer 8 week fast blood glucose level lipid profile weight gain measure slow twitch soleus fast twitch extensor digitorum longus edl skeletal muscle weigh assess triglyceride tg content histological analysis lipid peroxidation level gene expression evaluate qrt pcr apocynin reduce blood glucose level improve body weight exhibit hypolipidemic effect significantly increase muscle weight edl soleus especially edl muscle lower triglyceride lipid peroxidation increase fiber size additionally decrease mrna expression level murf-1 atrogin-1 myostatin p47phox mrna upregulated pgc-1α follistatin mrna apocynin exert myoprotective effect mitigate muscle atrophy diabetic rat effect differentially mediate tg accumulation muscle fiber size reduce oxidative stress atrogene expression positively regulate pgc-1α
40565091,Inhibition of Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase Prevents Docetaxel-Induced Painful Peripheral Neuropathy.,"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a painful condition recalcitrant to current available therapies. CIPN pain can be severe and dose-limiting or dose-reducing for life-extending chemotherapeutics and, to date, there is no treatment to alter the progression of CIPN. For these experiments we used docetaxel, a first-line therapy for metastatic prostate cancer in humans and investigated the soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor EC5026 for its analgesic efficacy against this CIPN pain. Male SD rats (n = 10/group) were pretreated with 1 mg/kg EC5026 in formulated drinking water or vehicle for one week prior to docetaxel injections. The rats continued the formulated drinking water during three once-a-week docetaxel 10 mg/kg i.p. injections and were maintained on treatment until the end of week 5 when all groups were transitioned to normal drinking water. Nociceptive testing occurred throughout the entire experiment including after transitioning to normal drinking water. EC5026 increased mechanical withdrawal thresholds and latencies on the cold plate compared to docetaxel-treated controls. There were no motor effects of the compound, and the formulated drinking water provided favorable exposure. These results demonstrated that EC5026 administered prophylactically was both analgesic and able to limit the severity of mechanical and cold sensitivities in the docetaxel CIPN rat model.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Karen M Wagner; Jun Yang; Christophe Morisseau; Bruce D Hammock,chemotherapy induce peripheral neuropathy cipn painful condition recalcitrant current available therapy cipn pain severe dose limiting dose reduce life extend chemotherapeutic date treatment alter progression cipn experiment docetaxel line therapy metastatic prostate cancer human investigate soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor ec5026 analgesic efficacy cipn pain male sd rat n = 10 group pretreate 1 mg kg ec5026 formulated drinking water vehicle week prior docetaxel injection rat continue formulated drinking water week docetaxel 10 mg kg i.p injection maintain treatment end week 5 group transition normal drinking water nociceptive testing occur entire experiment include transition normal drinking water ec5026 increase mechanical withdrawal threshold latency cold plate compare docetaxel treat control motor effect compound formulated drinking water provide favorable exposure result demonstrate ec5026 administer prophylactically analgesic able limit severity mechanical cold sensitivity docetaxel cipn rat model

Here, we explored the potential of early montelukast (MLK) therapy, a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 antagonist, on LUT function and structure four weeks after severe SCI in rats. Rats (strain Lewis, female, n = 50) received a permanent bladder catheter, followed by a complete T9 spinal cord transection. MLK was given daily, starting on day one post-injury. Bladder and locomotor function were regularly assessed. Bladder tissue was histologically and immunhistochemically analyzed. Post-SCI, MLK concentrations in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid were clinically relevant. MLK improved bladder functionality. MLK had no impact on smooth muscle alignment and uroepithelial integrity at this early SCI time point. This pilot study gave first insights into early, continuous oral MLK treatment with the first promising results of preserved LUT function and possible subsequent improved tissue integrity.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Elena E Keller; Sophina Bauer; Karin Roider; Michael Kleindorfer; Peter Törzsök; Julia Tevini; Thomas Felder; Ludwig Aigner; Lukas Lusuardi,bladder dysfunction drastic quality life reduce condition spinal cord injury sci neuroinflammation low urinary tract lut sci key driver neurogenic bladder dysfunction tissue fibrosis leukotriene group highly active lipid mediator potent inflammatory mediator explore potential early montelukast mlk therapy cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 antagonist lut function structure week severe sci rat rat strain lewis female n = 50 receive permanent bladder catheter follow complete t9 spinal cord transection mlk give daily start day post injury bladder locomotor function regularly assess bladder tissue histologically immunhistochemically analyze post sci mlk concentration plasma cerebrospinal fluid clinically relevant mlk improve bladder functionality mlk impact smooth muscle alignment uroepithelial integrity early sci time point pilot study give insight early continuous oral mlk treatment promising result preserve lut function possible subsequent improved tissue integrity
40565068,Neuroprotective Potential of Betulin and Its Drug Formulation with Cyclodextrin-In Vitro Assessment.,"Central nervous system disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, are associated with complex pathophysiological mechanisms involving oxidative stress, inflammation, and protein misfolding. According to the literature, betulin, a natural compound derived from the bark of birch trees, demonstrates promising neuroprotective effects. This study investigates the neuroprotective potential of betulin and its complex with cyclodextrin, referred to as Betula Forte, using an in vitro model of differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Specifically, the study explores the antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties of these compounds under oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Our results indicated that Betula Forte exhibited lower cytotoxicity compared to betulin alone. Both substances enhanced cell viability in pre-incubation and co-incubation models, with Betula Forte showing superior efficacy under severe oxidative stress. Additionally, both substances exhibited protective effects against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis, as evidenced by reduced levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a lower number of apoptotic cells compared with the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells. These findings suggest that Betula Forte, due to lower cytotoxicity, may offer a more effective neuroprotective strategy than betulin alone, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Agnieszka Zakrzeska; Agnieszka Kołodziejczyk; Piotr Komorowski; Paulina Sokołowska; Bożena Rokita; Radosław A Wach; Małgorzata Siatkowska,central nervous system disorder alzheimer disease parkinson disease multiple sclerosis associate complex pathophysiological mechanism involve oxidative stress inflammation protein misfolde accord literature betulin natural compound derive bark birch tree demonstrate promise neuroprotective effect study investigate neuroprotective potential betulin complex cyclodextrin refer betula forte vitro model differentiated sh sy5y neuroblastoma cell specifically study explore antioxidant antiapoptotic property compound oxidative stress induce hydrogen peroxide h < sub>2</sub > o < sub>2</sub > result indicate betula forte exhibit low cytotoxicity compare betulin substance enhance cell viability pre incubation co incubation model betula forte show superior efficacy severe oxidative stress additionally substance exhibit protective effect h < sub>2</sub > o < sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress apoptosis evidence reduced level reactive oxygen specie ros low number apoptotic cell compare h < sub>2</sub > o < sub>2</sub>-treate cell finding suggest betula forte low cytotoxicity offer effective neuroprotective strategy betulin highlight potential therapeutic agent neurodegenerative disease
40565060,DMPC-Based Liposomal Vesicles for Encapsulation and Controlled Release of NMN and Matrigel in Sarcopenia Therapy.,"Accurate diagnosis of diseases in patients is crucial, particularly in older individuals, where the focus is often placed primarily on advanced age and its associated symptoms. However, advancements in technology and research have revealed that certain diseases traditionally linked to aging can also manifest in younger populations, demonstrating similar bodily changes. One such condition is sarcopenia, a degenerative disease of skeletal muscle that arises from various pathological processes affecting the tissues. In this study, we developed a liposomal formulation based on 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC), in which both nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and Matrigel (Mgel) were co-encapsulated, each playing a distinct role in the management of sarcopenia. NMN is known to stimulate the increase of NAD+ levels, while Matrigel enhances the activity of satellite cells, thereby facilitating muscle fiber regeneration and stabilizing protein levels. Results from the DLS, SEM, and TEM analyses revealed significant differences attributed to the type of therapeutic agent used and the synthesis parameters. Additionally, the drug release profile underscored the complementary nature and significance of selecting the appropriate active substances for effective treatment strategies. The in vitro investigations aimed to assess the potential of DMPC lipid vesicles loaded with NMN, either alone or in combination with Matrigel, to counteract sarcopenia-associated oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. The results showed that both NMN-based formulations reduced oxidative damage, preserved mitochondrial function, and maintained cytoskeletal integrity in a hydrogen peroxide-induced model of sarcopenia. Importantly, the formulation containing both NMN and Matrigel demonstrated superior protective effects, suggesting a synergistic role of the extracellular matrix components in enhancing muscle cell resilience. These findings support the use of DMPC-based delivery systems as promising candidates for sarcopenia therapy and warrant further investigation into their mechanisms of action in preventing muscle cell degeneration.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Alfred Najm; Alexandra Cătălina Bîrcă; Adelina-Gabriela Niculescu; Adina Alberts; Alexandru Mihai Grumezescu; Bianca Gălățeanu; Bogdan Ștefan Vasile; Mircea Beuran; Bogdan Severus Gaspar; Claudiu Ștefan Turculeț; Ariana Hudiță,"accurate diagnosis disease patient crucial particularly old individual focus place primarily advanced age associated symptom advancement technology research reveal certain disease traditionally link aging manifest young population demonstrate similar bodily change condition sarcopenia degenerative disease skeletal muscle arise pathological process affect tissue study develop liposomal formulation base 1,2 dimyristoyl sn glycero-3 phosphocholine dmpc nicotinamide mononucleotide nmn matrigel mgel co encapsulate play distinct role management sarcopenia nmn know stimulate increase nad+ level matrigel enhance activity satellite cell facilitate muscle fiber regeneration stabilize protein level result dls sem tem analysis reveal significant difference attribute type therapeutic agent synthesis parameter additionally drug release profile underscore complementary nature significance select appropriate active substance effective treatment strategy vitro investigation aim assess potential dmpc lipid vesicle load nmn combination matrigel counteract sarcopenia associate oxidative stress mitochondrial dysfunction result show nmn base formulation reduce oxidative damage preserve mitochondrial function maintain cytoskeletal integrity hydrogen peroxide induce model sarcopenia importantly formulation contain nmn matrigel demonstrate superior protective effect suggest synergistic role extracellular matrix component enhance muscle cell resilience finding support use dmpc base delivery system promise candidate sarcopenia therapy warrant investigation mechanism action prevent muscle cell degeneration"
40565018,RIPK1 in Diffuse Glioma Pathology: From Prognosis Marker to Potential Therapeutic Target.,"Diffuse gliomas (DGs) are malignant primary brain tumors originating from glial cells. This study aimed to investigate the role of Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) in DG pathology. The RIPK1 mRNA expression was analyzed in DG databases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) containing clinical, genomic, and transcriptomic information from 670 patients. Transcriptomic studies were carried out using USC Xena and R, while in vitro assays were performed with the glioblastoma human cell line U251 and the commercial RIPK1 inhibitor GSK2982772. The results showed that high RIPK1 expression was linked to a lower survival probability in patients. Additionally, the RIPK1 expression was higher in the wtIDH samples compared to that in the mIDH samples. Significant differences in the expression of genes related to cellular dedifferentiation, proinflammatory cell death pathways, and tumor-infiltrating immune cells were found between high- and low-RIPK1 expression groups. To further characterize the role of RIPK1 in DG, the effects of the RIPK1 inhibitor were evaluated, alone or combined with cisplatin, on glioblastoma cell proliferation and apoptosis. The combined treatments effectively reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. The overexpression of RIPK1 was associated with a poor prognosis for DG, suggesting that RIPK1 plays a critical role in glioma pathogenesis and should be considered in therapeutic decision-making.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Leslie C Amorós Morales; Santiago M Gómez Bergna; Abril Marchesini; María Luján Scalise; Nazareno Gonzalez; M Leticia Ferrelli; Marianela Candolfi; Víctor Romanowski; Matias L Pidre,diffuse glioma dgs malignant primary brain tumor originate glial cell study aim investigate role receptor interact protein kinase 1 ripk1 dg pathology ripk1 mrna expression analyze dg database cancer genome atlas tcga contain clinical genomic transcriptomic information 670 patient transcriptomic study carry usc xena r vitro assay perform glioblastoma human cell line u251 commercial ripk1 inhibitor gsk2982772 result show high ripk1 expression link low survival probability patient additionally ripk1 expression high wtidh sample compare midh sample significant difference expression gene relate cellular dedifferentiation proinflammatory cell death pathway tumor infiltrate immune cell find high- low ripk1 expression group characterize role ripk1 dg effect ripk1 inhibitor evaluate combine cisplatin glioblastoma cell proliferation apoptosis combined treatment effectively reduce cell proliferation increase apoptosis overexpression ripk1 associate poor prognosis dg suggest ripk1 play critical role glioma pathogenesis consider therapeutic decision making

40565009,Reduced Gene Dosage of the Psychiatric Risk Gene <i>Cacna1c</i> Is Associated with Impairments in Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Activity in Rats.,"Common and rare variation in <i>CACNA1C</i> gene expression has been consistently associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression. However, the underlying biological pathways that cause this association have yet to be fully determined. In this study, we present evidence that rats with a reduced gene dosage of <i>Cacna1c</i> have increased basal corticosterone levels in the periphery and reduced the expression of <i>Nr3c1</i> encoding the glucocorticoid receptor in the hippocampus and hypothalamus. These results are consistent, with an effect of <i>Cacna1c</i> dosage on hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function. Heterozygous <i>Cacna1c</i> rats had lower levels of the histone markers H3K4me3 and H3K27acat exon 1<sub>7</sub> of the <i>Nr3c1</i> gene. These histone modifications are typically linked to increased gene expression, but here were not associated with changes in the expression of exon 1<sub>7</sub> variants under non-stress conditions. Heterozygous <i>Cacna1c</i> rats additionally show increased anxiety behaviours. These results support an association of <i>Cacna1c</i> heterozygosity with the altered activity of the HPA axis and function in the resting state, and this may be a predisposing mechanism that contributes to the increased risk of psychiatric disorders with stress.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Anna L Moon; Eleanor R Mawson; Patricia Gasalla; Lawrence S Wilkinson; Dominic M Dwyer; Jeremy Hall; Kerrie L Thomas,common rare variation < > cacna1c</i > gene expression consistently associate neuropsychiatric disorder schizophrenia bipolar disorder major depression underlie biological pathway cause association fully determine study present evidence rat reduce gene dosage < > cacna1c</i > increase basal corticosterone level periphery reduce expression < > nr3c1</i > encode glucocorticoid receptor hippocampus hypothalamus result consistent effect < > cacna1c</i > dosage hypothalamus pituitary adrenal hpa axis function heterozygous < > cacna1c</i > rat low level histone marker h3k4me3 h3k27acat exon 1 < sub>7</sub > < > nr3c1</i > gene histone modification typically link increase gene expression associate change expression exon 1 < sub>7</sub > variant non stress condition heterozygous < > cacna1c</i > rat additionally increase anxiety behaviour result support association < > cacna1c</i > heterozygosity altered activity hpa axis function resting state predisposing mechanism contribute increase risk psychiatric disorder stress
40565005,Beyond Transgenic Mice: Emerging Models and Translational Strategies in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia and a growing public health concern worldwide. Despite decades of research, effective disease-modifying treatments remain elusive, partly due to limitations in current experimental models. The purpose of this review is to critically assess and compare existing murine and alternative models of AD to identify key strengths, limitations, and future directions for model development that can enhance translational relevance and therapeutic discovery. Traditional transgenic mouse models have advanced the understanding of amyloid-beta and tau pathologies, but often fail to capture the complexity of sporadic, late-onset AD. In response, alternative models-including zebrafish, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, non-human primates, and human brain organoids-are gaining traction due to their complementary insights and diverse experimental advantages. This review also discusses innovations in genetic engineering, neuroimaging, computational modelling, and drug repurposing that are reshaping the landscape of AD research. By integrating these diverse approaches, the review advocates for a multi-model, multidisciplinary strategy to improve the predictive power, accelerate clinical translation, and inform personalised therapeutic interventions. Ethical considerations and equitable access to diagnostics and emerging treatments are also emphasised. Ultimately, this work aims to support the development of more accurate, effective, and human-relevant models to combat AD.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Paula Alexandra Lopes; José L Guil-Guerrero,alzheimer disease ad lead cause dementia grow public health concern worldwide despite decade research effective disease modify treatment remain elusive partly limitation current experimental model purpose review critically assess compare exist murine alternative model ad identify key strength limitation future direction model development enhance translational relevance therapeutic discovery traditional transgenic mouse model advance understanding amyloid beta tau pathology fail capture complexity sporadic late onset ad response alternative model include zebrafish < > drosophila melanogaster</i > < > caenorhabditis elegans</i > non human primate human brain organoid gain traction complementary insight diverse experimental advantage review discuss innovation genetic engineering neuroimaging computational modelling drug repurposing reshape landscape ad research integrate diverse approach review advocate multi model multidisciplinary strategy improve predictive power accelerate clinical translation inform personalise therapeutic intervention ethical consideration equitable access diagnostic emerge treatment emphasise ultimately work aim support development accurate effective human relevant model combat ad
40564999,Plasma Proteome Profiling Reveals Inflammation Markers and Tafamidis Effects in V30M Transthyretin Polyneuropathy.,"Transthyretin (TTR) variant (V30M) polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN) is a progressive systemic amyloidosis caused by transthyretin aggregation, leading to a variety of debilitating manifestations, including neuropathy and cardiomyopathy. We investigated the plasma proteome of heterozygotic V30M TTR asymptomatic carriers and heterozygotic V30M ATTRv-PN patients (before and after tafamidis treatment) versus WT TTR healthy control plasma using an organic solvent-induced shift in solubility assay to identify biosignatures for disease progression and therapeutic response. We identified many proteins, including TTR, apolipoproteins, ceruloplasmin, and proteins with functions in innate immunity that displayed changes in either their abundances or their sensitivity to precipitation. Elevated oxidative modifications of TTR and APOE in ATTRv-PN patients suggest a role for oxidative stress in disease pathogenesis/progression. Tafamidis treatment mitigated these pathology-associated changes, suggesting that alleviating proteotoxic stress impacts these other pathways. Although our study was limited to a Portuguese cohort, these findings nevertheless provide a comprehensive plasma proteomic profile of V30M ATTRv-PN patients, V30M TTR carriers, and tafamidis-treated ATTRv-PN patients over up to 60 months; provide insights into ATTRv-PN pathophysiology; identify potential biomarkers for disease progression and therapeutic response; and highlight the utility of proteomics in advancing personalized treatments for amyloidosis.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Karina Nugroho; Chung-Yon Lin; Cecilia Monteiro; Teresa Coelho; James J Moresco; Antonio F M Pinto; Evan T Powers; John R Yates; Jolene K Diedrich; Jeffery W Kelly,transthyretin ttr variant v30 m polyneuropathy attrv pn progressive systemic amyloidosis cause transthyretin aggregation lead variety debilitate manifestation include neuropathy cardiomyopathy investigate plasma proteome heterozygotic v30 m ttr asymptomatic carrier heterozygotic v30 m attrv pn patient tafamidis treatment versus wt ttr healthy control plasma organic solvent induce shift solubility assay identify biosignature disease progression therapeutic response identify protein include ttr apolipoprotein ceruloplasmin protein function innate immunity display change abundance sensitivity precipitation elevated oxidative modification ttr apoe attrv pn patient suggest role oxidative stress disease pathogenesis progression tafamidis treatment mitigate pathology associate change suggest alleviate proteotoxic stress impact pathway study limit portuguese cohort finding provide comprehensive plasma proteomic profile v30 m attrv pn patient v30 m ttr carrier tafamidis treat attrv pn patient 60 month provide insight attrv pn pathophysiology identify potential biomarker disease progression therapeutic response highlight utility proteomic advance personalize treatment amyloidosis
40564997,"MiR 329/449 Suppresses Cell Proliferation, Migration and Synergistically Sensitizes GBM to TMZ by Inhibiting Src/FAK, NF-kB, and Cyclin D1 Activity.","Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is one of the most common brain tumors and is associated with aggressive tumor characteristics and extremely poor patient survival. The median survival time for GBM patients is around 12-15 months. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a key chemotherapeutic drug used in the treatment of GBM. However, at least 50% of GBM patients do not respond to TMZ, necessitating the identification of novel therapeutic strategies sensitizing patients to TMZ. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of two different tumor suppressor microRNAs (miR-329 and miR-449b) on cell proliferation and migration of GBM cells, and their potential for sensitizing GBM cells to TMZ. Our findings show that MiR-329/449b treatments suppressed spheroid formation and migration of GBM (LN229 and U87) cells. When miR treatments were combined with Temozolomide (TMZ), we also observed that they synergistically enhanced the suppressive effects of TMZ and inhibited the activity of clinically significant NF-KB and Src/FAK signaling pathways, making the combination therapy a viable option to treat GBM, with greater impact on patient survival.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Megan Mendieta; Mehrdad Bandegi; Ezgi Biltekin; Yasemin M Akay; Bulent Ozpolat; Metin Akay,glioblastoma multiforme gbm common brain tumor associate aggressive tumor characteristic extremely poor patient survival median survival time gbm patient 12 15 month temozolomide tmz key chemotherapeutic drug treatment gbm 50 gbm patient respond tmz necessitate identification novel therapeutic strategy sensitize patient tmz study aim investigate effect different tumor suppressor micrornas mir-329 mir-449b cell proliferation migration gbm cell potential sensitize gbm cell tmz finding mir-329/449b treatment suppress spheroid formation migration gbm ln229 u87 cell mir treatment combine temozolomide tmz observe synergistically enhance suppressive effect tmz inhibit activity clinically significant nf kb src fak signal pathway make combination therapy viable option treat gbm great impact patient survival
40564996,The Retinal Dopaminergic Circuit as a Biomarker for Huntington's and Alzheimer's Diseases.,"Retinal dysfunction is emerging as a potential early marker of neurodegenerative diseases. Within the retina, the dopaminergic circuit, comprising dopaminergic amacrine cells, dopamine synthesis and turnover, and dopamine receptor signalling, is essential for visual processing, particularly colour contrast perception. Disruption of this circuit may underline early retinal alterations observed in Huntington's disease (HD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we systematically analysed retinal dopaminergic dysfunction in murine models of HD (genetic origin) and AD (sporadic), across different disease stages. We assessed dopamine levels, turnover, tyrosine hydroxylase expression, D1 and D2 receptor gene expression, and neurotransmitter balance. HD mice showed early and marked alterations: reduced dopamine content, decreased tyrosine hydroxylase, increased turnover, and downregulation of D1 receptor expression-all preceding motor symptoms and detectable brain pathology. In contrast, AD mice showed only mild changes at later stages; however, clinical evidence suggests that similar dysfunction may occur earlier in human AD. These findings position retinal dopaminergic disruption as a potential early biomarker in HD and possibly in AD. While the current study relies on invasive techniques in animal models, it lays the groundwork for non-invasive retinal assessments, such as electroretinography or optical coherence tomography, as promising tools for early diagnosis and disease monitoring in neurodegeneration.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Pedro Blanco-Hernán; Lorena Aguado; María José Asensio; Ana Gómez-Soria; Pedro de la Villa; María José Casarejos; Alicia Mansilla,retinal dysfunction emerge potential early marker neurodegenerative disease retina dopaminergic circuit comprise dopaminergic amacrine cell dopamine synthesis turnover dopamine receptor signal essential visual processing particularly colour contrast perception disruption circuit underline early retinal alteration observe huntington disease hd alzheimer disease ad study systematically analyse retinal dopaminergic dysfunction murine model hd genetic origin ad sporadic different disease stage assess dopamine level turnover tyrosine hydroxylase expression d1 d2 receptor gene expression neurotransmitter balance hd mouse show early marked alteration reduce dopamine content decrease tyrosine hydroxylase increase turnover downregulation d1 receptor expression precede motor symptom detectable brain pathology contrast ad mouse show mild change late stage clinical evidence suggest similar dysfunction occur early human ad finding position retinal dopaminergic disruption potential early biomarker hd possibly ad current study rely invasive technique animal model lay groundwork non invasive retinal assessment electroretinography optical coherence tomography promising tool early diagnosis disease monitoring neurodegeneration
40564995,Breaking the Triad: Immune Tolerance Induction Without Antigen Co-Presentation via Tim Agonist for the Treatment of Autoimmune Diseases.,"Autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) are characterized by a loss of self-tolerance, driven by diminished regulatory T cell (Treg) function and elevated Th1/Th17 responses. Existing therapies broadly suppress the immune system without correcting this imbalance, often leading to adverse effects. LPX3, a novel small-molecule T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing 3 and 4 (Tim-3/4) receptor agonist, was developed to restore immune tolerance via Treg induction. In this study, LPX3 was formulated into a liposomal oral delivery system, enabling efficient uptake through the gastrointestinal tract and lymphatic targeting. In vitro and in vivo analyses confirmed LPX3's ability to expand CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs in a dose-dependent manner. In a MOG-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS, both prophylactic and therapeutic oral administration of LPX3 significantly delayed disease onset, reduced symptom severity, and improved survival. Importantly, efficacy was achieved without antigen co-delivery, indicating an antigen-independent mechanism of immune modulation. LPX3 liposomes showed deep lymph node penetration and colocalization with immune cells, supporting its functional delivery to key immunological sites.

40564991,Understanding the Role of Endocannabinoids in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.,"Posttraumatic stress disorder is often treatment-resistant and recent research has suggested that treatment outcomes might be improved by modulation of the endocannabinoid system. The current review article describes animal and human research examining the effect of endocannabinoid modulation on posttraumatic symptoms, behaviours, and relevant memory processes. While the preclinical literature is reasonably consistent, emerging human literature is mixed. This review explores some potential reasons for why human research in this field is inconsistent and proposes multiple avenues for future research to answer these questions.

40564988,Serum Insulin-like Growth Factor-II Is Associated with Poor Poststroke Outcomes in Males: A Secondary Analysis.,"The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system has significance for poststroke outcomes. Previously, we reported that low serum IGF-II (s-IGF-II) in the acute phase is associated with poststroke mortality, and that IGF-II is lower among males. Given the known interactions of the IGF system and estrogen receptor signaling, s-IGF-II may have sex-specific effects. In this study, we conducted a secondary analysis of sex differences in s-IGF-II and poststroke functional outcomes and mortality after ischemic stroke (IS) in the Sahlgrenska Academy Study on Ischemic Stroke (SAHLSIS, males; <i>n</i> = 315, females; <i>n</i> = 177). Functional outcomes were assessed using the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 3 months and 2 years poststroke. Survival was recorded for 7 years or until death. Males in the lowest quintile of acute s-IGF-II had a higher poststroke mortality, with a crude hazard ratio [HR] of 2.52 (95% confidence interval [CI]) 1.59-3.99) and an adjusted HR of 1.83 (95% CI 1.09-3.06). No corresponding significant association was observed in females. Although acute s-IGF-II was crudely associated with poor functional outcomes among males after 3 months and 2 years, these associations were not independent of initial stroke severity in adjusted models. In conclusion, low levels of acute s-IGF-II are linked with poststroke mortality among males, but not significantly in females.

40564986,"Subcortical Circuits Among Pedunculopontine Nucleus, Thalamus and Basal Ganglia Play Important Roles in Paroxysmal Arousal in Genetic Rat Models of Autosomal Dominant Sleep-Related Hypermotor Epilepsy.","A part of autosomal dominant sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (ADSHE) is caused by mutant CHRNA4. The pathomechanisms underlying motor seizures followingly brief/sudden awakening (paroxysmal arousal) in ADSHE seizures remain to be clarified. This study determined extracellular levels of ACh and L-glutamate in the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) and its projection regions, including the thalamus and basal ganglia, during wakefulness, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and paroxysmal arousal of transgenic rats bearing rat S286L-mutant Chrna4 (S286L-TG), corresponding to human S284L-mutant CHRNA4, using microdialysis. The expression of connexin43 and pannexin1 in the plasma membrane of the PPN was determined using capillary immunoblotting. The expressions of connexin43 and pannexin1 in the PPN plasma membrane of S286L-TG were larger than the wild type. The extracellular L-glutamate levels in the PPN and projection regions of S286L-TG consistently increased during both wakefulness and SWS compared to the wild type. The extracellular levels of ACh and L-glutamate in the PPN and projection regions decreased accompaning SWS in the wild type. In S286L-TG, this decreasing extracellular ACh level was observed, whereas decreasing L-glutamate level was impaired. Both extracellular levels of ACh and L-glutamate in the PPN and projection regions drastically increased during paroxysmal arousal. Hemichannel inhibitors suppressed the increasing releases of ACh and L-glutamate induced by paroxysmal arousal but decreased and did not affect extracellular levels of L-glutamate and ACh during wakefulness and SWS, respectively. In particular, under hemichannels inhibition, decreasing L-glutamate release accompanying SWS was observed in S286L-TG. This study elucidated that enhanced hemichannels are predominantly involved in the dysfunction of glutamatergic transmission compared to AChergic transmission during the interictal stage in S286L-TG, whereas the hyperactivation of hemichannels contributes to the generation of paroxysmal arousal.

40564978,Effect of Mutations in the C-Terminal 22-24 Domains of Filamin C Associated with Cardio- and Myopathies on Its Interaction with Small Heat Shock Protein HspB7.,"We investigated the interaction of HspB7 and its α-crystallin domain with the wild-type (WT) C-terminal fragment of human filamin C (FLNC), containing immunoglobulin-like domains 22-24 and its three mutants associated with cardio- and myopathies. The physicochemical properties of the WT FLNC fragment and its three mutants, p.Glu2472_Asn2473delinsAsp (EN/D) located in the 22nd domain, p.P2643_L2645del (ΔPGL), and p.W2710X (Wmut) both located in the 24th immunoglobulin-like domain were analyzed. Although all FLNC fragments had similar secondary structures, WT FLNC and its EN/D and ΔPGL mutants formed dimers, whereas Wmut formed either monomers or aggregates. The surface hydrophobicity of EN/D, ΔPGL, and especially Wmut mutants was larger than that of the WT fragment. Size exclusion chromatography, native gel electrophoresis, and chemical crosslinking indicated that the efficiency of interaction with HspB7 or its α-crystallin domain decreased in the order WT~EN/D > ΔPGL. Wmut was unable to interact with either HspB7 or its α-crystallin domain. Modeling via Alphafold 3 indicated that EN/D mutation affected the orientation of two loops connecting β-strands in the 22nd domain, while the ΔPGL and Wmut mutations exposed a hydrophobic groove in the 24th domain thereby reducing their interaction with HspB7.

40564976,Comprehensive Anatomical Staging Predicts Clinical Progression in Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Data-Driven Approach.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents significant challenges in clinical practice due to its heterogeneous manifestation and variable progression rates. This work develops a comprehensive anatomical staging framework to predict progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Using the ADNI database, the scalable Subtype and Stage Inference (s-SuStaIn) model was applied to 118 neuroanatomical features from cognitively normal (<i>n</i> = 504) and AD (<i>n</i> = 346) participants. The framework was validated on 808 MCI participants through associations with clinical progression, CSF and FDG-PET biomarkers, and neuropsychiatric measures, while adjusting for common confounders (age, gender, education, and APOE ε4 alleles). The framework demonstrated superior prognostic accuracy compared to traditional risk assessment (C-index = 0.73 vs. 0.62). Four distinct disease subtypes showed differential progression rates, biomarker profiles (FDG-PET and CSF Aβ42), and cognitive trajectories: Subtype 1, subcortical-first pattern; Subtype 2, executive-cortical pattern; Subtype 3, disconnection pattern; and Subtype 4, frontal-executive pattern. Stage-dependent changes revealed systematic deterioration across diverse cognitive domains, particularly in learning acquisition, visuospatial processing, and functional abilities.

40564972,Unveiling GABA and Serotonin Interactions During Neurodevelopment to Re-Open Adult Critical Periods for Neuropsychiatric Disorders.,"The mature brain is the result of a complex neurodevelopmental process resulting from interweaved mechanisms and involving early genetic and microenvironmental factors shaped by patterns of spontaneous electrical activity. During postnatal development, the immature brain undergoes experience-dependent structural and functional shaping and modifications during critical period (CP) time windows to achieve the full maturation of brain functions. Plasticity is higher during neurodevelopmental CP windows and is limited in the adult brain, including during neuropsychiatric disorders. Notably, the neurotransmitters γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and serotonin are two fundamental players controlling and modulating, respectively, brain plasticity in the developing and adult brain. Therefore, acquiring insights into the roles played by GABA and serotonin in regulating CP plasticity might hold potential for pharmacologically re-opening CP windows in adult life, with the aim of providing therapeutic intervention for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Emanuela Beretta; Gianmarco Cuboni; Gabriele Deidda,mature brain result complex neurodevelopmental process result interweaved mechanism involve early genetic microenvironmental factor shape pattern spontaneous electrical activity postnatal development immature brain undergo experience dependent structural functional shaping modification critical period cp time window achieve maturation brain function plasticity high neurodevelopmental cp window limit adult brain include neuropsychiatric disorder notably neurotransmitter γ aminobutyric acid gaba serotonin fundamental player control modulating respectively brain plasticity develop adult brain acquire insight role play gaba serotonin regulate cp plasticity hold potential pharmacologically opening cp window adult life aim provide therapeutic intervention neurological neuropsychiatric disorder
40564971,Omega-3 Fatty Acids Mitigate Long-Lasting Disruption of the Endocannabinoid System in the Adult Mouse Hippocampus Following Adolescent Binge Drinking.,"Adolescent binge drinking has lasting behavioral consequences by disrupting the endocannabinoid system (ECS) and depleting brain omega-3. The natural accumulation of omega-3 fatty acids in cell membranes is crucial for maintaining the membrane structure, supporting interactions with the ECS, and restoring synaptic plasticity and cognition impaired by prenatal ethanol (EtOH) exposure. However, it remains unclear whether omega-3 supplementation can mitigate the long-term effects on the ECS, endocannabinoid-dependent synaptic plasticity, and cognition following adolescent binge drinking. Here, we demonstrated that omega-3 supplementation during EtOH withdrawal increases CB1 receptors in hippocampal presynaptic terminals of male mice, along with the recovery of receptor-stimulated [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding to Gαi/o proteins. These changes are associated with long-term potentiation (LTP) at excitatory medial perforant path (MPP) synapses in the dentate gyrus (DG), which depends on anandamide (AEA), transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Finally, omega-3 intake following binge drinking reduced the time and number of errors required to locate the escape box in the Barnes maze test. Collectively, these findings suggest that omega-3 supplementation restores Barnes maze performance to levels comparable to those of control mice after adolescent binge drinking. This recovery is likely mediated by modulation of the hippocampal ECS, enhancing endocannabinoid-dependent excitatory synaptic plasticity.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Maitane Serrano; Miquel Saumell-Esnaola; Garazi Ocerin; Gontzal García Del Caño; Edgar Soria-Gómez; Amaia Mimenza; Nagore Puente; Itziar Bonilla-Del Río; Almudena Ramos-Uriarte; Leire Reguero; Brian R Christie; Fernando Rodríguez de Fonseca; Marta Rodríguez-Arias; Inmaculada Gerrikagoitia; Pedro Grandes,adolescent binge drinking last behavioral consequence disrupt endocannabinoid system ecs deplete brain omega-3 natural accumulation omega-3 fatty acid cell membrane crucial maintain membrane structure support interaction ecs restore synaptic plasticity cognition impair prenatal ethanol etoh exposure remain unclear omega-3 supplementation mitigate long term effect ecs endocannabinoid dependent synaptic plasticity cognition follow adolescent binge drinking demonstrate omega-3 supplementation etoh withdrawal increase cb1 receptor hippocampal presynaptic terminal male mouse recovery receptor stimulate < sup>35</sup > s]gtpγs bind gαi o protein change associate long term potentiation ltp excitatory medial perforant path mpp synapsis dentate gyrus dg depend anandamide aea transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 trpv1 n methyl d aspartate nmda receptor finally omega-3 intake follow binge drinking reduce time number error require locate escape box barnes maze test collectively finding suggest omega-3 supplementation restore barnes maze performance level comparable control mouse adolescent binge drinking recovery likely mediate modulation hippocampal ecs enhance endocannabinoid dependent excitatory synaptic plasticity
40564965,"Understanding the Immune System's Intricate Balance: Activation, Tolerance, and Self-Protection.","Understanding the mechanisms of immune activation and deactivation is paramount. A host must initiate effective immunity against pathogenic infections while avoiding triggering immunity against self-antigens, which can lead to detrimental autoimmune disorders. Host immunological pathways can be categorized as Immunoglobulin (Ig)G-dominant eradicable immune reactions and IgA-dominant tolerable immune reactions. Eradicable immune reactions include Th1, Th2, Th22, and Thαβ immune responses against four different types of pathogens. Tolerable immune reactions include Th1-like, Th9, Th17, and Th3 immune responses against four different types of pathogens. Here, we try to determine the mechanisms of activation and deactivation of host immune reactions. The spleen and liver play contrasting roles in mediating immune responses: the spleen is primarily involved in immune activation, whereas the liver is responsible for immune deactivation. Similarly, the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems have opposing functions in immune modulation, with the sympathetic system promoting pro-inflammatory responses and the parasympathetic system facilitating anti-inflammatory processes. Furthermore, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and glucocorticosteroids exhibit contrasting effects on immune regulation: ACTH is involved in activating adaptive immunity while inhibiting innate immunity, whereas glucocorticosteroids activate natural IgM antibody associated with innate immunity while inhibiting adaptive immunity. Heat shock proteins, particularly molecular chaperones induced by fever, play pivotal roles in immune activation. Conversely, IgD B cells and gamma/delta T cells contribute to immune deactivation through mechanisms such as clonal anergy. Understanding these mechanisms provides insights into immunological pathways, aiding in the better management of infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Jui-Yun Chen; Li-Jane Shih; Min-Tser Liao; Kuo-Wang Tsai; Kuo-Cheng Lu; Wan-Chung Hu,understand mechanism immune activation deactivation paramount host initiate effective immunity pathogenic infection avoid trigger immunity self antigen lead detrimental autoimmune disorder host immunological pathway categorize immunoglobulin ig)g dominant eradicable immune reaction iga dominant tolerable immune reaction eradicable immune reaction include th1 th2 th22 thαβ immune response different type pathogen tolerable immune reaction include th1 like th9 th17 th3 immune response different type pathogen try determine mechanism activation deactivation host immune reaction spleen liver play contrast role mediate immune response spleen primarily involve immune activation liver responsible immune deactivation similarly sympathetic parasympathetic nervous system oppose function immune modulation sympathetic system promote pro inflammatory response parasympathetic system facilitate anti inflammatory process furthermore adrenocorticotropic hormone acth glucocorticosteroid exhibit contrast effect immune regulation acth involve activate adaptive immunity inhibit innate immunity glucocorticosteroid activate natural igm antibody associate innate immunity inhibit adaptive immunity heat shock protein particularly molecular chaperone induce fever play pivotal role immune activation conversely igd b cell gamma delta t cell contribute immune deactivation mechanism clonal anergy understand mechanism provide insight immunological pathway aid well management infectious disease autoimmune disorder
40564963,Co-Aggregation of Syndecan-3 with β-Amyloid Aggravates Neuroinflammation and Cognitive Impairment in 5×FAD Mice.,"Abnormal deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) is a core pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Syndecan-3 (SDC3), a type I transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), is abnormally overexpressed in the brains of AD patients and model animals, specifically accumulating in the peri-plaque region of amyloid plaques. However, its regulatory mechanism in the process of Aβ deposition remains unclear. This study aims to clearly define the role of SDC3 in Aβ aggregation and neuroinflammation, two critical processes in AD pathogenesis. Specifically, we investigate how SDC3 modulates Aβ aggregation and its interaction with neuroinflammatory pathways, which may contribute to the progression of AD. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying SDC3's involvement in these processes, we seek to provide new insights into potential therapeutic targets for AD. In this study, a 5×FAD mouse model with downregulated SDC3 expression was constructed. Behavioral assessments and synaptic function tests were performed to explore the effects of SDC3 on cognition in 5×FAD mice. Immunofluorescence co-localization technology was utilized to analyze the pathological co-deposition of SDC3 and Aβ in the hippocampus, cortex, and meningeal blood vessels. Quantitative assessments of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as <i>Tnf-α</i> and <i>Cxcl10</i> in the brain were performed through histopathological analysis combined with qPCR. Western blotting was used to examine the phosphorylation status of STAT1/STAT3 and the expression changes of IBA1/GFAP to systematically analyze the molecular mechanisms through which SDC3 regulates AD pathology. This study revealed that SDC3 expression was significantly upregulated in the brain regions of the 5×FAD model mice and co-localized pathologically with Aβ. Cell lineage tracing analysis showed that the elevated SDC3 expression primarily originated from glial cells. Behavioral and pathological results demonstrated that downregulation of SDC3 significantly improved cognitive dysfunction in the model mice and effectively reduced the Aβ burden in the brain. Molecular mechanism studies showed that downregulation of SDC3 reduced the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3, thereby inhibiting the activation of the JAK-STAT and cGAS-STING signaling pathways, reducing the activation of microglia/astrocytes and suppressing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as <i>Tnf-α</i> and <i>Cxcl10</i>. This study reveals that SDC3 co-localizes with Aβ pathology and synergistically exacerbates neuroinflammation. Knockdown of SDC3 can simultaneously reduce both Aβ deposition and the release of inflammatory factors from glial cells. Mechanistic research indicates that SDC3 drives a ""glial activation-cytokine release"" vicious cycle through the JAK-STAT and cGAS-STING signaling pathways. These findings suggest that SDC3 may serve as a key hub coordinating amyloid pathology and neuroinflammation in AD, providing new insights for the development of combination therapies targeting the HSPG network.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Fan Ye; Mingfeng Li; Min Liu; Xinghan Wu; Fan Tian; Yanju Gong; Yan Cao; Jingtai Zhang; Xueling Zhang; Chuan Qin; Ling Zhang,abnormal deposition β amyloid aβ core pathological feature alzheimer disease ad syndecan-3 sdc3 type transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan hspg abnormally overexpresse brain ad patient model animal specifically accumulate peri plaque region amyloid plaque regulatory mechanism process aβ deposition remain unclear study aim clearly define role sdc3 aβ aggregation neuroinflammation critical process ad pathogenesis specifically investigate sdc3 modulate aβ aggregation interaction neuroinflammatory pathway contribute progression ad elucidate mechanism underlie sdc3 involvement process seek provide new insight potential therapeutic target ad study 5×fad mouse model downregulate sdc3 expression construct behavioral assessment synaptic function test perform explore effect sdc3 cognition 5×fad mouse immunofluorescence co localization technology utilize analyze pathological co deposition sdc3 aβ hippocampus cortex meningeal blood vessel quantitative assessment pro inflammatory cytokine < > tnf α</i > < > cxcl10</i > brain perform histopathological analysis combine qpcr western blotting examine phosphorylation status stat1 stat3 expression change iba1 gfap systematically analyze molecular mechanism sdc3 regulate ad pathology study reveal sdc3 expression significantly upregulate brain region 5×fad model mouse co localized pathologically aβ cell lineage trace analysis show elevated sdc3 expression primarily originate glial cell behavioral pathological result demonstrate downregulation sdc3 significantly improve cognitive dysfunction model mouse effectively reduce aβ burden brain molecular mechanism study show downregulation sdc3 reduce phosphorylation stat1 stat3 inhibit activation jak stat cgas sting signal pathway reduce activation microglia astrocyte suppress expression pro inflammatory cytokine < > tnf α</i > < > cxcl10</i > study reveal sdc3 co localize aβ pathology synergistically exacerbate neuroinflammation knockdown sdc3 simultaneously reduce aβ deposition release inflammatory factor glial cell mechanistic research indicate sdc3 drive glial activation cytokine release vicious cycle jak stat cgas sting signal pathway finding suggest sdc3 serve key hub coordinate amyloid pathology neuroinflammation ad provide new insight development combination therapy target hspg network

In this study, we investigated whether monogenic forms of PD are more prevalent in these patients and clinically defined their characteristics. Eighty-eight PD patients were part of the analysis. All patients received clinical diagnoses from experienced movement disorder specialists. Each patient underwent transcranial ultrasonography and genetic testing for mutations in the <i>SNCA</i>, <i>PRKN</i>, <i>LRRK2</i>, <i>DJ1</i>, and <i>PINK1</i> genes. SN hyperechogenicity was identified in 48 patients. Compared to the non-hyperechogenicity group, these patients did not have monogenic forms of PD more frequently, but they did have REM sleep behavior disorder significantly more often, lived in rural areas, and experienced a later age of disease onset. Our study indicated no association between substantia nigra echogenicity and the presence of mutations in the <i>SNCA</i>, <i>LRRK2</i>, <i>DJ1</i>, <i>PRKN</i>, and <i>PINK1</i> genes.

40564942,Molecular Screening Reveals De Novo Loss-of-Function <i>NR4A2</i> Variants in Saudi Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Single-Center Study.,"Dysregulated expression of nuclear receptor superfamily 4 group A member 2 (<i>NR4A2</i>) has recently been associated with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), speech impairment, and neurodevelopmental delay (NDD); however, its precise role in the prevalence and etiopathogenesis of ASD has not been fully elucidated. Herein, we aimed to explore the role of <i>NR4A2</i> variants in the genetic underpinnings of ASD among Saudi children of different age ranges and phenotype severities. A total of 338 children with ASD from 315 unrelated families (293 simplex, 2 quads, and 1 quintet) were screened for <i>NR4A2</i> variants via exome sequencing (ES) of the genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), after which the probands with identified <i>NR4A2</i> variants were further subjected to trio genetic analyses. ES analysis revealed 10 de novo <i>NR4A2</i> variants (5 indels/nonsense, 2 missense, and 3 variants affecting splicing) in 8 unrelated probands (2.37%) and 2 affected siblings from 8 unrelated families (6 simplex (2.04%) and 2 quads (8.7%)). Three <i>NR4A2</i> variants were notably recurrent among both affected and unaffected carriers. All identified indels and two splicing variants met the criteria for pathogenic/loss-of-function (LoF) variants according to the ACMG classification (PVS1), whereas the missense variants were classified as of uncertain significance (VUS).

40564934,Homocysteinylation of Fibrinogen: A Post-Translational Link to Thrombosis.,"Homocysteinylation, a post-translational modification involving the covalent attachment of homocysteine to proteins, has emerged as a critical mechanism linking hyperhomocysteinemia to thrombotic disease. This review focuses on the homocysteinylation of fibrinogen, a key coagulation factor, and its impact on clot structure and function. Evidence indicates that elevated homocysteine levels can induce significant changes in fibrin architecture, promoting the formation of dense, rigid clots with reduced permeability and impaired fibrinolytic susceptibility, thus fostering a prothrombotic environment. However, inconsistencies in reported effects on fiber diameter and polymerization kinetics highlight the need for standardized experimental protocols. Advances in proteomics and high-resolution imaging are expected to clarify the molecular underpinnings of these modifications. Moreover, homocysteinylation intersects with oxidative stress and may serve as a mechanistic bridge between metabolic and vascular dysfunction. Understanding its role not only enhances insight into thrombosis but also opens avenues for biomarker discovery and targeted therapies in cardiovascular and potentially neurological disorders.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Elvira Giurranna; Francesca Nencini; Serena Borghi; Ilenia Barbaro; Niccolò Taddei; Claudia Fiorillo; Matteo Becatti,homocysteinylation post translational modification involve covalent attachment homocysteine protein emerge critical mechanism link hyperhomocysteinemia thrombotic disease review focus homocysteinylation fibrinogen key coagulation factor impact clot structure function evidence indicate elevated homocysteine level induce significant change fibrin architecture promote formation dense rigid clot reduce permeability impaired fibrinolytic susceptibility foster prothrombotic environment inconsistency report effect fiber diameter polymerization kinetic highlight need standardized experimental protocol advance proteomic high resolution imaging expect clarify molecular underpinning modification homocysteinylation intersect oxidative stress serve mechanistic bridge metabolic vascular dysfunction understand role enhance insight thrombosis open avenue biomarker discovery target therapy cardiovascular potentially neurological disorder
40564928,Breaking the Cycle: Can Vitamin D Bridge the Gap Between Gut Microbiota and Immune Dynamics in Multiple Sclerosis?,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease with autoimmune and neurodegenerative features that affect the nervous system. Genetic predisposition and environmental factors, such as vitamin D deficiency and dysbiosis activating a pro-inflammatory response, have a role in the etiology of the disease. In this context, the interactions of vitamin D with the gut microbiota and immune system have attracted attention in recent years. Vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol) modulates the immune response by binding to the Vitamin D receptor (VDR). This pathway supports the functions of regulatory T cells by suppressing the activity of T helper cells 1 and 17 (Th1 and Th17). In MS patients, dysbiosis is characterized by a decrease in microbial diversity, and an increase in pro-inflammatory species is observed when compared to healthy individuals. Vitamin D has protective effects on eubiosis via VDR in intestinal epithelial cells, also reducing intestinal permeability by regulating tight junction proteins. In this way, vitamin D may contribute to the prevention of systemic inflammation. Although the relationship between vitamin D and the immune system is well documented, studies that address the triad of vitamin D level, gut microbiota, and immune response in MS are still limited.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025.0,Feray Gençer Bingöl; Emine Kocyigit; Elif Çelik; Duygu Ağagündüz; Ferenc Budán,"multiple sclerosis ms chronic disease autoimmune neurodegenerative feature affect nervous system genetic predisposition environmental factor vitamin d deficiency dysbiosis activate pro inflammatory response role etiology disease context interaction vitamin d gut microbiota immune system attract attention recent year vitamin d 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol modulate immune response bind vitamin d receptor vdr pathway support function regulatory t cell suppress activity t helper cell 1 17 th1 th17 ms patient dysbiosis characterize decrease microbial diversity increase pro inflammatory specie observe compare healthy individual vitamin d protective effect eubiosis vdr intestinal epithelial cell reduce intestinal permeability regulate tight junction protein way vitamin d contribute prevention systemic inflammation relationship vitamin d immune system document study address triad vitamin d level gut microbiota immune response ms limited"

40564903,Prolonged Intestinal Ethanol Absorption and Oxidative Stress: Revisiting the Gut-Liver Axis in Alcohol-Associated Disease.,"Chronic alcohol consumption induces oxidative stress not only in the liver but also in the gastrointestinal tract, where prolonged intestinal ethanol absorption plays a pivotal and underrecognized role. This review reframes ethanol pharmacokinetics to emphasize sustained jejunal and ileal uptake, which maintains elevated blood alcohol levels and perpetuates redox imbalance across the gut-liver axis. We integrate recent findings on ethanol-induced barrier dysfunction, CYP2E1-mediated ROS production, microbial dysbiosis, and mitochondrial disruption, proposing that the intestine is an active site of injury and a driver of systemic inflammation. Key mechanistic insights reveal that gut-derived endotoxins, compromised epithelial integrity, and microbiome-mitochondria interactions converge to exacerbate hepatic and extrahepatic damage.

40564895,Assessment of White Matter Changes Using Quantitative T1ρ Mapping in an Open-Field Low-Intensity Blast Mouse Model of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI).,"Blast-induced mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) occurs when shock waves travel through blood vessels and cerebrospinal fluid, leading to cerebral demyelination, which results in cognitive impairments and neuropsychiatric issues that impact quality of life. This study aims to evaluate myelin changes in white matter in mice with mTBI induced by an open-field low-intensity blast (LIB) using a newly implemented 3D adiabatic T1ρ prepared fast spin echo (Adiab-T1ρ-FSE) sequence for quantitative T1ρ MRI mapping. Thirty male C57BL/6 mice, including 15 mTBI and 15 sham controls, were scanned on a 3T Bruker MRI scanner.

40564755,"The Many Faces of Child Abuse: How Clinical, Genetic and Epigenetic Correlates Help Us See the Full Picture.","Child abuse is a pervasive global issue with significant implications for the physical, emotional, and psychological well-being of victims. This review highlights the clinical, molecular, and therapeutic dimensions of child abuse, emphasizing its long-term impact and the need for interdisciplinary approaches. Early exposure to abuse activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to chronic cortisol release and subsequent neuroplastic changes in brain regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex. These molecular alterations, including epigenetic modifications and inflammatory responses, contribute to the heightened risk of psychiatric disorders and chronic illnesses in survivors. Clinically, child abuse presents with diverse manifestations ranging from physical injuries to psychological and developmental disorders, making timely diagnosis challenging. A multidisciplinary approach involving thorough clinical evaluation, detailed histories, and collaboration with child protection services is essential for accurate diagnosis and effective intervention. Recent advances in molecular biology have identified biomarkers, such as stress-related hormones and epigenetic changes, which provide novel insights into the physiological impact of abuse and potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Current treatment strategies prioritize the child's safety, psychological well-being, and prevention of further abuse. Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy and family-centered interventions are pivotal in promoting recovery and resilience. Emerging research focuses on integrating molecular findings with clinical practice, utilizing digital health tools, and leveraging big data to develop predictive models and personalized treatments. Interdisciplinary collaboration remains crucial to translating research into policy and practice, ultimately aiming to mitigate the impact of child abuse and improve outcomes for survivors.","Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2025.0,Enrico Parano; Vito Pavone; Martino Ruggieri; Iside Castagnola; Giuseppe Ettore; Gaia Fusto; Roberta Rizzo; Piero Pavone,child abuse pervasive global issue significant implication physical emotional psychological victim review highlight clinical molecular therapeutic dimension child abuse emphasize long term impact need interdisciplinary approach early exposure abuse activate hypothalamic pituitary adrenal hpa axis lead chronic cortisol release subsequent neuroplastic change brain region hippocampus amygdala prefrontal cortex molecular alteration include epigenetic modification inflammatory response contribute heighten risk psychiatric disorder chronic illness survivor clinically child abuse present diverse manifestation range physical injury psychological developmental disorder make timely diagnosis challenge multidisciplinary approach involve thorough clinical evaluation detailed history collaboration child protection service essential accurate diagnosis effective intervention recent advance molecular biology identify biomarker stress relate hormone epigenetic change provide novel insight physiological impact abuse potential target therapeutic intervention current treatment strategy prioritize child safety psychological prevention abuse trauma focus cognitive behavioral therapy family center intervention pivotal promote recovery resilience emerge research focus integrate molecular finding clinical practice utilize digital health tool leverage big datum develop predictive model personalized treatment interdisciplinary collaboration remain crucial translate research policy practice ultimately aim mitigate impact child abuse improve outcome survivor
40564752,Education Improves Perceived Control but Not Risk Identification in Adolescents Regarding Fentanyl.,"In 2022, 2.2 million adolescents were diagnosed with substance use disorders, including 265,000 with opioid use disorder. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health revealed that 130,000 adolescents misused prescription pain medications, often obtaining them from friends or relatives. This age group perceives weekly heroin use as less risky than those younger or older. A questionnaire was developed for 7th to 12th graders in a rural Texas school district as part of a fentanyl awareness curriculum. The questionnaire included Likert scale, multiple choice, and yes/no questions. The participants were categorized into younger (grades 7th and 8th) and older students (grades 9th through 12th), and associations were explored between demographic characteristics, responses, and grade groups using chi-square tests. To assess confidence, behavior, and the impact of education, we used chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. The participants (<i>n</i> = 94; 85.11%) identified as Hispanic or Latino, with a smaller percentage identifying as White or more than one race. An association was found between feeling more in control of actions related to substances and fentanyl (<i>p</i>-value = 0.04) after receiving education. No association was found between education and confidence in identifying fentanyl. This study aligns with a surge in fentanyl-related overdose deaths in a high-intensity drug trafficking region. Recent fentanyl overdoses among school-age children prompted legislative changes in 2023, making this study valuable for understanding the epidemic within the geographical context. These results suggest that school-based education may play a role in strengthening adolescents' behavioral intentions to fentanyl exposure, though additional efforts are needed to improve risk identification.","Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2025.0,Christine Bakos-Block; Francine R Vega; Marylou Cardenas-Turanzas; Bhanumathi Gopal; Tiffany Champagne-Langabeer,"2022 2.2 million adolescent diagnose substance use disorder include 265,000 opioid use disorder national survey drug use health reveal 130,000 adolescent misuse prescription pain medication obtain friend relative age group perceive weekly heroin use risky young old questionnaire develop 7th 12th grader rural texas school district fentanyl awareness curriculum questionnaire include likert scale multiple choice yes question participant categorize young grade 7th 8th old student grade 9th 12th association explore demographic characteristic response grade group chi square test assess confidence behavior impact education chi square fisher exact test participant < > n</i > = 94 85.11 identify hispanic latino small percentage identify white race association find feel control action relate substance fentanyl < > p</i>-value = 0.04 receive education association find education confidence identify fentanyl study align surge fentanyl relate overdose death high intensity drug trafficking region recent fentanyl overdose school age child prompt legislative change 2023 make study valuable understand epidemic geographical context result suggest school base education play role strengthen adolescent behavioral intention fentanyl exposure additional effort need improve risk identification"
40564745,The Role of Caregivers in Supporting Personal Recovery in Youth with Mental Health Concerns.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Mental disorders that emerge during adolescence frequently extend into adulthood, predicting poor academic and employment outcomes and heavy societal burdens. Novel efforts to improve youth mental health have transitioned from clinical recovery, typically focused on a cure, to a strength-based approach to wellbeing in supporting youth within mental health services. Mental health scholars have appealed for interventions to adopt an ecological system of care approach that integrates the principal caregivers in a young person's life. Despite preliminary literature indicating the importance of caregivers, little research has focused on the caregiver's role in supporting personal recovery in youth. <b>Methods</b>: This study sought to understand the role of caregivers in youth recovery by employing a qualitative design to inductively analyze the narratives from nine semi-structured interviews with caregivers. Additionally, deductive analysis explored the core five underpinnings of personal recovery connectedness, hope, identity, meaning, and empowerment (CHIME). <b>Results</b>: A thematic analysis of the literature identified five themes: providing unconditional love and positive regard; encouraging connection with peers; co-creating a sense of purpose, meaning, and hope; supporting assertiveness and advocacy; and promoting strength and opportunity for mastery aligning with the CHIME framework. The findings will allow health services to understand caregivers' roles better, thus providing information to guide recovery-oriented and family-centered care.","Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2025.0,Denise B McKern; Govind Krishnamoorthy; Vicki C Dallinger; Diane Heart; Darryl Maybery,< b > background objectives:</b > mental disorder emerge adolescence frequently extend adulthood predict poor academic employment outcome heavy societal burden novel effort improve youth mental health transition clinical recovery typically focus cure strength base approach wellbee support youth mental health service mental health scholar appeal intervention adopt ecological system care approach integrate principal caregiver young person life despite preliminary literature indicate importance caregiver little research focus caregiver role support personal recovery youth < b > methods</b > study seek understand role caregiver youth recovery employ qualitative design inductively analyze narrative semi structured interview caregiver additionally deductive analysis explore core underpinning personal recovery connectedness hope identity meaning empowerment chime < b > results</b > thematic analysis literature identify theme provide unconditional love positive regard encourage connection peer co create sense purpose meaning hope support assertiveness advocacy promote strength opportunity mastery align chime framework finding allow health service understand caregiver role well provide information guide recovery orient family center care

40564707,Significance of Oral Care for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder-A Narrative Literature Review.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition in children that typically involves challenges in cognition, behavior, and communication. While many children with ASD exhibit significant impairments in both verbal and non-verbal communication, the severity and nature of these difficulties can vary widely. In addition to its impact on overall health, ASD also affects oral health, leading to increased vulnerability to dental disease. This narrative review aims to summarize key oral health challenges and care strategies for children with ASD, focusing on clinical risks, behavioral barriers, caregiver roles, and effective interventions. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using four databases-PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar-as well as relevant study registries where applicable. Peer-reviewed articles published in English between 2010 and 2024 were identified using keywords and their synonyms, such as autism spectrum disorder, children, oral care, dental practitioners, and parents. Studies were included based on relevance to oral health challenges and interventions in children diagnosed with ASD. Children with ASD experience a range of sensory sensitivities, attention deficits, hyperactivity, and behavioral resistance, which significantly hinder the performance of adequate oral hygiene practices. These challenges contribute to a lack of effective dental prophylaxis and limited access to regular preventive care, ultimately resulting in poorer oral health outcomes and reduced oral health-related quality of life. Due to the multifaceted characteristics of ASD, children with this condition face significant barriers in accessing appropriate and individualized oral care. This increases their risks of developing oral health disorders, underscoring the need for coordinated efforts between caregivers and dental professionals to improve oral health outcomes in this vulnerable population.","Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2025.0,Sirma Angelova; Desislava Konstantinova; Anna Nenova-Nogalcheva; Rouzha Pancheva,autism spectrum disorder asd neurodevelopmental condition child typically involve challenge cognition behavior communication child asd exhibit significant impairment verbal non verbal communication severity nature difficulty vary widely addition impact overall health asd affect oral health lead increase vulnerability dental disease narrative review aim summarize key oral health challenge care strategy child asd focus clinical risk behavioral barrier caregiver role effective intervention comprehensive literature search conduct database pubmed scopus web science google scholar relevant study registry applicable peer review article publish english 2010 2024 identify keyword synonyms autism spectrum disorder child oral care dental practitioner parent study include base relevance oral health challenge intervention child diagnose asd child asd experience range sensory sensitivity attention deficit hyperactivity behavioral resistance significantly hinder performance adequate oral hygiene practice challenge contribute lack effective dental prophylaxis limited access regular preventive care ultimately result poor oral health outcome reduce oral health relate quality life multifaceted characteristic asd child condition face significant barrier access appropriate individualized oral care increase risk develop oral health disorder underscore need coordinate effort caregiver dental professional improve oral health outcome vulnerable population
40564688,Associations Between Eating Disorders and Sociodemographic Factors in Adolescent Patients Since the Start of the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with significant increases in mental-health-related concerns in adolescents, including eating disorders. Disparities in screening, diagnosis, and treatment impact adolescents with eating disorders. This study aimed to describe the patterns in the prevalence and the associations between eating disorder diagnoses and demographic factors in adolescent patients since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. We performed a retrospective cohort study examining adolescent patients (aged 12 to 21) with an eating disorder (ED) diagnosis documented between January 2019 and July 2023 using Epic Systems Corporation's Cosmos, a de-identified dataset aggregated from electronic health record (EHR) data. We examined the differences in demographic factors by utilizing chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests. A total of 82,435 distinct adolescent and young adult patients with eating disorder diagnoses were included in the analytical dataset. The overall prevalence of EDs has increased since 2019. The median age of patients with an ED decreased between 2019 and 2023. There was a decrease in other eating disorder diagnoses and an increase in avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) during the study period. There was a decrease in the proportion of individuals who identified as White and an increase in the proportion of adolescents from historically minoritized racial and ethnic groups (i.e., African American or Black and Hispanic). There was also an increase, during this study period, in the proportion of adolescents with an ED diagnosis who were from more socially vulnerable communities. Our study describes the changes in the prevalence of sociodemographic factors in adolescent patients with EDs since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

40564656,The Incidence of Misdiagnosis in Patients with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.,"<b>Background</b>: Misdiagnosis, defined as the incorrect identification of a condition or the failure to identify a condition altogether, can lead to delayed treatment, unnecessary interventions, and avoidable morbidity and mortality. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a complex pain disorder that is often misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed due to lack of awareness among healthcare providers and variability in diagnostic criteria. <b>Objectives</b>: This study aimed to determine the misdiagnosis rate of hypermobile EDS (hEDS) with psychiatric disorders by physicians who are not board-certified in psychiatry. <b>Methods</b>: Between January 2010 and December 2018, the medical records of 429 patients who were diagnosed with hEDS were reviewed and analyzed. During the process of taking a history, patients were asked if they had previously been told by physicians who were not board-certified in psychiatry that their symptoms were ""in their head"", that they were ""making it up"" or seeking attention, or that they might suffer from Munchausen syndrome by proxy or a factitious disorder, or if such physicians had diagnosed them with conversion disorder. The Brown University Human Research Protection Program determined that the proposed activity was not research involving human subjects. <b>Results</b>: A retrospective chart review was conducted. Among the 429 patients, 405 patients (94.4%) said yes to at least one of the questions, with only 24 patients (5.6%) not having been misdiagnosed with psychiatric illnesses. A total of 378 patients (88%) were told that they were ""making it up"", 326 patients (76%) were told that they were attention-seeking, 286 patients (67%) were diagnosed with conversion disorder, 255 patients (60%) were told that ""it was in their head"", and 16 patients (4%) were diagnosed with Munchausen syndrome by proxy or a factitious disorder. <b>Conclusions</b>: Misdiagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is a pervasive issue with profound implications for patients' physical, mental, and economic well-being.

40564632,Untangling the Threads: The Impact of Co-Occurring OCD and ADHD Symptoms for Black and/or Latiné Youth.,"<b>Introduction:</b> Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are neuropsychiatric diagnoses that commonly co-occur, as approximately 25% of youth with OCD also have a diagnosis of ADHD and 11% of youth with ADHD have OCD. Individuals with ADHD and OCD are also commonly treated for symptoms of depression, anxiety, and traumatic experiences. Conversely, Black and Latiné youth in the United States have limited access to culturally responsive providers to address these conditions due to systemic racism; the lower rates of appropriate diagnosis, treatment, and inclusion in research create worsening symptoms of OCD. Thus, we sought to understand how ADHD symptoms affect OCD symptoms and how these comorbid diagnoses, in addition to anxiety disorders, affect reported anxiety, depression, and trauma for Black and/or Latiné teens. <b>Procedures:</b> Participants (<i>N</i> = 48) are Black and/or Latina/é/o youth with ADHD in the United States. Self and parent-report measures were completed for ADHD, anxiety, and depression, and a semi-structured interview was conducted to assess current mental health diagnoses (OCD, ADHD, trauma). <b>Results:</b> A path analysis showed higher levels of ADHD inattentive (ADHDI) symptoms (β = 0.34) were positively associated with obsessions. In contrast, higher ADHD hyperactive/impulsivity symptoms (ADHDHI) (β = -0.11) were negatively associated with obsessions. Neither ADHDI nor ADHDHI symptoms were associated with compulsions. Interestingly, ADHDI (β = 0.33) & obsessions (β = 0.28) were both associated with depression; however, ADHDHI was negatively associated with depression (β = -0.29). Importantly, ADHDI was associated with trauma (β = 0.13) and obsessions were strongly associated with anxiety (β = 0.38). <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings may allow for better screenings and treatments for co-occurring OCD and ADHD symptoms and a greater understanding of the impact depression, anxiety, and trauma have on neurodivergent Black and/or Latiné youth.","Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2025.0,Terumi S Randle; Laurel N Miskovic; Victoria R Grant O'Daniel; Anjo I Okechukwu; Najiya Shahzad; Kayla C Mkandawire; Madeline Warrick; Zoe R Smith,< b > introduction:</b > obsessive compulsive disorder ocd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd neuropsychiatric diagnosis commonly co occur approximately 25 youth ocd diagnosis adhd 11 youth adhd ocd individual adhd ocd commonly treat symptom depression anxiety traumatic experience conversely black latiné youth united states limit access culturally responsive provider address condition systemic racism low rate appropriate diagnosis treatment inclusion research create worsen symptom ocd seek understand adhd symptom affect ocd symptom comorbid diagnosis addition anxiety disorder affect report anxiety depression trauma black and/or latiné teen < b > procedures:</b > participants < > n</i > = 48 black and/or latina é o youth adhd united states self parent report measure complete adhd anxiety depression semi structured interview conduct assess current mental health diagnosis ocd adhd trauma < b > results:</b > path analysis show high level adhd inattentive adhdi symptom β = 0.34 positively associate obsession contrast high adhd hyperactive impulsivity symptom adhdhi β = -0.11 negatively associate obsession adhdi adhdhi symptom associate compulsion interestingly adhdi β = 0.33 obsession β = 0.28 associate depression adhdhi negatively associate depression β = -0.29 importantly adhdi associate trauma β = 0.13 obsession strongly associate anxiety β = 0.38 < b > conclusions:</b > finding allow well screening treatment co occurring ocd adhd symptom great understanding impact depression anxiety trauma neurodivergent black and/or latiné youth
40564623,Interventions to Promote Civic Engagement Among Youth and Its Outcomes on Mental Health: A Scoping Review.,"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Youth mental health significantly impacts future well-being, with nearly half of mental health disorders emerging during adolescence. Civic engagement is defined as active participation in the community to improve conditions for others or to help shape the community's future. It offers a unique opportunity to enhance youth mental well-being, acting as a protective factor against mental health struggles. In this line, Relational Developmental Systems Theory posits that positive youth development is positively linked to civic engagement. The main objective of this literature-based paper is to identify, select, assess, and synthesize the existing literature on interventions promoting mental health in the youth through civic engagement, resulting in an up-to-date review. <b>Methods</b>: Following PRISMA guidelines, a search was conducted using PsycInfo, Scopus, and Web of Science to gather studies published between 2018 and 2023, based on the combination of key terms: (""civic engagement"" OR ""social participation"") AND (""mental health"" OR ""psychological adjustment"" OR ""well-being"") AND (adolescen* OR teen* OR youth OR ""young people"") AND (program* OR intervention OR training OR education). Data extraction and risk-of-bias assessments were performed. <b>Results</b>: Ten studies were included in this review which suggest that civic engagement programs improve youth mental health outcomes, including reduced anxiety, reduced sadness, and increased resilience. These programs foster empowerment, sense of belonging, and social connections, while also enhancing interpersonal skills and career aspirations. Youth also gain valuable skills such as leadership, communication, and problem-solving, contributing to educational and vocational growth. However, challenges such as socio-economic barriers and attendance issues can impact some outcomes, with variations in effectiveness across programs. <b>Conclusions</b>: Youth civic engagement programs should integrate mental health support to mitigate the emotional costs of activism, ensuring greater participation and well-being. It is important to adapt these programs to local contexts and provide flexibility to strengthen participation and community impact.

40564596,Ins and Outs of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) Intervention in Promoting Social Communicative Abilities and Theory of Mind in Children and Adolescents with ASD: A Systematic Review.,"Social-communicative abilities and theory of mind (ToM) are crucial for successful social interactions. The developmental trajectories of social and communicative skills characterizing individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are rather complex and multidimensional, including components related to theory of mind. Due to its mentalistic nature, theory of mind has been rarely addressed as an outcome for Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) intervention in children and adolescents with ASD. However, there is evidence that ABA intervention might be effective in promoting social abilities in individuals with ASD. Thus, this topic is worth investigating. We present a systematic review to explore the Ins and Outs of an ABA approach to promote social and communicative abilities and ToM in children and adolescents with ASD. We applied a PRISMA checklist to consider studies published up to December 2024. The keywords that we used were ToM, perspective-taking, false belief, social cognition, and mental states, in combination with ABA intervention and ASD (up to age 18). We searched for studies using Scopus, Google Scholar, and Medline. We included twenty studies on perspective-taking, identifying emotions, helping, detecting eye gazing, and social engagement, reviewing fifteen dedicated to teaching the interpretation of mental states (involving 49 children and 10 adolescents). The ToM was addressed with a multiple baseline design on target behaviors associated with ToM components such as identifying emotion, helping behaviors, and mental states. The intervention included a behavioral package consisting of Behavioral Skill Training, Derived Relations, video modeling, and role playing. The results indicated a significant number of participants who followed ABA intervention to promote social abilities and mastered the target behavior in ToM tasks; however, they showed maintenance and generalization issues across trials and settings. The role of predictors was highlighted. However, the studies are still rare and exhibit specific methodological limitations, as well as some clinical and ethical considerations.

40564567,"Unraveling the Longitudinal Relationships Among Parenting Stress, Preschoolers' Problem Behavior, and Risk of Learning Disorder.","Problem behaviors and the risk of learning disorders in early childhood carry significant implications for children's future development. Understanding the relationship between parenting stress and these developmental outcomes may inform the design of effective interventions to promote healthy child development. The present longitudinal study investigated the association between parenting stress and preschoolers' risk of learning disorders, specifically focusing on the mediating role of problem behaviors. Data were collected at two time points, approximately 6 months apart, from 284 preschool-aged children and their parents (mean age of children at Time 1 = 56.64 months; 53.17% of them were girls). Parents completed standardized assessments of parenting stress, children's problem behaviors, and the risk of learning disorders. An autoregressive cross-lagged panel model within a half-longitudinal framework was employed to test the hypothesized mediation model. Results revealed that parenting stress had a direct effect on both children's problem behaviors and their risk of learning disorders. Moreover, children's problem behaviors partially mediated the longitudinal association between parenting stress and learning disorder risk. Specifically, the indirect effect size was statistically significant (<i>β</i> = 0.022, <i>p</i> = 0.025), indicating that increased parenting stress contributed to approximately a 2.2% increase in the risk of learning disorders through elevated problem behaviors.

40564541,Social Cognition in Suicidal Behavior in Psychosis: A Systematic Review.,"Suicide is a major concern worldwide, especially in psychotic disorders that have an increased risk for suicidal behavior (SB). There are many well-established risk factors for SB in psychosis. Still, others, such as the domains of social cognition (SC)-the theory of mind, social perception, emotional processing, and attributional style-are unclarified. We aim to review evidence on SC and SB in psychosis and clarify their relationship, examining the differences between SC domains and the potential mediating variables in this relationship and proposing that worse performance in regard to SC is related to a higher risk of suicide. We searched databases for papers on SC and SB published between 2009 and 2024, resulting in the 18 articles included in this systematic review. Individuals with psychotic disorders and SB showed better emotional processing for basic emotional recognition-although they performed poorly on more complex tasks-and exhibited greater empathy within the affective theory of mind. Cognitive biases associated with attributional style and increased distrust as part of social perception were also found. Our findings cannot establish a relationship with the cognitive theory of mind. So, further studies are needed to integrate all domains of SC in longitudinal studies and examine the mediating variables of these relationships.","Behavioral sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2025.0,María Carcedo Herrero; Aina Sastre-Buades; Maria Luisa Barrigón,suicide major concern worldwide especially psychotic disorder increase risk suicidal behavior sb establish risk factor sb psychosis domain social cognition sc)-the theory mind social perception emotional processing attributional style unclarified aim review evidence sc sb psychosis clarify relationship examine difference sc domain potential mediating variable relationship propose bad performance regard sc relate high risk suicide search database paper sc sb publish 2009 2024 result 18 article include systematic review individual psychotic disorder sb show well emotional processing basic emotional recognition perform poorly complex task exhibit great empathy affective theory mind cognitive bias associate attributional style increase distrust social perception find finding establish relationship cognitive theory mind study need integrate domain sc longitudinal study examine mediating variable relationship
40564527,Phubbing Behaviour: A Bibliometric Analysis of Scientific Production.,"Phubbing refers to the act of ignoring someone in a face-to-face conversation by paying more attention to a mobile phone. This practice, although common, has been identified as harmful and deserves to be considered a problem. As a result, it has captured the attention of the scientific community, with a significant increase in studies in recent years. However, there is a lack of bibliometric analyses examining existing research on this topic, which would be useful in guiding future studies. This article seeks to fill that gap by providing a detailed bibliometric analysis of phubbing. It analyses the entire production in the Web of Science database between 1985 and 2022 (199 articles and 82 keywords). The study employs citation, co-occurrence, and co-citation analysis techniques using scientific maps created with VOSviewer software. The results indicate that most research has focused on how phubbing affects romantic relationships, with less emphasis on other types of relationships such as family, work, or friends. Areas that require further research are identified, such as motivations for internet use, the tendency to compare oneself on social networks, impulsivity, and the influence of executive functions on phubbing. Further exploration of the relationship between phubbing and other disorders is also suggested. This analysis will serve as a guide and stimulus for future research, offering valuable resources for professionals in psychology, health, and education.","Behavioral sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2025.0,Ana Cebollero-Salinas; Begoña Gutiérrez-Nieto; Jacobo Cano-Escoriaza,phubbe refer act ignore face face conversation pay attention mobile phone practice common identify harmful deserve consider problem result capture attention scientific community significant increase study recent year lack bibliometric analysis examine exist research topic useful guide future study article seek fill gap provide detailed bibliometric analysis phubbing analyse entire production web science database 1985 2022 199 article 82 keyword study employ citation co occurrence co citation analysis technique scientific map create vosviewer software result indicate research focus phubbing affect romantic relationship emphasis type relationship family work friend area require research identify motivation internet use tendency compare oneself social network impulsivity influence executive function phubbe exploration relationship phubbing disorder suggest analysis serve guide stimulus future research offer valuable resource professional psychology health education
40564472,Anatomical Characteristics Predict Response to Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS): Development of a Computational Pipeline for Optimizing tDCS Protocols.,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique promisingly used to treat neurological and psychological disorders. Nevertheless, the inter-subject heterogeneity in its after-effects frequently limits its efficacy. This can be attributed to fixed-dose methods, which do not consider inter-subject anatomical variations. This work attempts to overcome this constraint by examining the effects of age and anatomical features, including the volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the thickness of the skull, and the composition of brain tissue, on electric field distribution and cortical excitability. A computational approach was used to map the electric field distribution over the brain tissues of realistic head models reconstructed from MRI images of twenty-three subjects, including adults and children of both genders. Significant negative correlations (<i>p</i> < 0.05) were found in the data between the maximum electric field strength and anatomical variable parameters. Furthermore, this study showed that the percentage of brain tissue exposed to an electric field amplitude above a pre-defined threshold (i.e., 0.227 V/m) was the main factor influencing the responsiveness to tDCS. In the end, the research suggests multiple regression models as useful tool to predict subjects' responsiveness and to support a personalized approach that tailors the injected current to the morphology of the patient.","Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)",2025.0,Giulia Caiani; Emma Chiaramello; Marta Parazzini; Eleonora Arrigoni; Leonor J Romero Lauro; Alberto Pisoni; Serena Fiocchi,transcranial direct current stimulation tdcs non invasive brain stimulation technique promisingly treat neurological psychological disorder inter subject heterogeneity effect frequently limit efficacy attribute fix dose method consider inter subject anatomical variation work attempt overcome constraint examine effect age anatomical feature include volume cerebrospinal fluid csf thickness skull composition brain tissue electric field distribution cortical excitability computational approach map electric field distribution brain tissue realistic head model reconstruct mri image subject include adult child gender significant negative correlation < > p</i > < 0.05 find datum maximum electric field strength anatomical variable parameter furthermore study show percentage brain tissue expose electric field amplitude pre define threshold i.e. 0.227 v m main factor influence responsiveness tdcs end research suggest multiple regression model useful tool predict subject responsiveness support personalized approach tailor inject current morphology patient
40564444,Spiking Neural Networks for Multimodal Neuroimaging: A Comprehensive Review of Current Trends and the NeuCube Brain-Inspired Architecture.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionising neuroimaging by enabling automated analysis, predictive analytics, and the discovery of biomarkers for neurological disorders. However, traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) face challenges in processing spatiotemporal neuroimaging data due to their limited temporal memory and high computational demands. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain's biological processes, offer a promising alternative. SNNs use discrete spikes for event-driven communication, making them energy-efficient and well suited for the real-time processing of dynamic brain data. Among SNN architectures, NeuCube stands out as a powerful framework for analysing spatiotemporal neuroimaging data. It employs a 3D brain-like structure to model neural activity, enabling personalised modelling, disease classification, and biomarker discovery. This paper explores the advantages of SNNs and NeuCube for multimodal neuroimaging analysis, including their ability to handle complex spatiotemporal patterns, adapt to evolving data, and provide interpretable insights. We discuss applications in disease diagnosis, brain-computer interfaces, and predictive modelling, as well as challenges such as training complexity, data encoding, and hardware limitations. Finally, we highlight future directions, including hybrid ANN-SNN models, neuromorphic hardware, and personalised medicine. Our contributions in this work are as follows: (i) we give a comprehensive review of an SNN applied to neuroimaging analysis; (ii) we present current software and hardware platforms, which have been studied in neuroscience; (iii) we provide a detailed comparison of performance and timing of SNN software simulators with a curated ADNI and other datasets; (iv) we provide a roadmap to select a hardware/software platform based on specific cases; and (v) finally, we highlight a project where NeuCube has been successfully used in neuroscience.

40564379,A 3D SVZonChip Model for In Vitro Mimicry of the Subventricular Zone Neural Stem Cell Niche.,"Neural stem cells (NSCs) are crucial components of the nervous system, primarily located in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone (SGZ). The SVZ neural stem cell niche (NSCN) is a specialized microenvironment where growth factors and extracellular matrix (ECM) components collaborate to regulate NSC self-renewal and differentiation. Despite its importance, our understanding of the SVZ remains incomplete due to the inherent challenges of animal research, particularly given the tissue's dynamic nature. To address these limitations, we developed a proof-of-concept, dynamic, and tissue-specific 3D organotypic SVZ model to reduce reliance on animal models. This static 3D organotypic model integrates a region-specific decellularized ECM derived from the SVZ, mimicking the native NSCN and supporting mouse-derived ependymal cells (ECs), radial glial cells (RGCs), astrocytes, and NSCs. To further improve physiological relevance, we incorporated a dynamic microfluidic culture system (SVZonChip), replicating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow as observed in vivo. The resulting SVZonChip platform, combining region-specific ECM proteins with dynamic culture conditions, provides a sustainable and reproducible tool to minimize animal model use. It holds significant promise for studying SVZ-related diseases, such as congenital hydrocephalus, stroke, and post-stroke neurogenesis, while advancing translational research and enabling personalized medicine protocols.","Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)",2025.0,Ioannis Angelopoulos; Konstantinos Ioannidis; Konstantina Gr Lyroni; Dimitris Vlassopoulos; Martina Samiotaki; Eleni Pavlidou; Xanthippi Chatzistavrou; Ioannis Papantoniou; Konstantinos Papageorgiou; Spyridon K Kritas; Ioannis Grivas,neural stem cell nscs crucial component nervous system primarily locate subventricular zone svz subgranular zone sgz svz neural stem cell niche nscn specialized microenvironment growth factor extracellular matrix ecm component collaborate regulate nsc self renewal differentiation despite importance understanding svz remain incomplete inherent challenge animal research particularly give tissue dynamic nature address limitation develop proof concept dynamic tissue specific 3d organotypic svz model reduce reliance animal model static 3d organotypic model integrate region specific decellularized ecm derive svz mimic native nscn support mouse derive ependymal cell ecs radial glial cell rgc astrocyte nscs improve physiological relevance incorporate dynamic microfluidic culture system svzonchip replicate cerebrospinal fluid csf flow observe vivo result svzonchip platform combine region specific ecm protein dynamic culture condition provide sustainable reproducible tool minimize animal model use hold significant promise study svz relate disease congenital hydrocephalus stroke post stroke neurogenesis advance translational research enable personalized medicine protocol
40564211,Enteroviral Transverse Myelitis Presenting as Acute Ataxia in Children: A Case Series.,"<b>Background</b>: Enteroviruses, members of the <i>Picornaviridae</i> family, typically cause asymptomatic or mild infections. However, they can also result in central nervous system (CNS) involvement, with transverse myelitis (TM) occurring only on rare occasions. TM is a syndrome characterized by acute or subacute spinal cord dysfunction, leading to neurological deficits below the level of the lesion. <b>Case report</b>: We report a case series of eight pediatric patients admitted over a three-month period, June to August 2024. All patients presented with ataxia and/or other neurological symptoms, alongside abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings. Although ataxia is commonly associated with cerebellitis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in this cohort revealed findings consistent with TM. Notably, all patients demonstrated similar MRI abnormalities. The onset of symptoms occurred over a short time during an enterovirus epidemic. Enteroviral RNA was detected, or the virus was isolated in seven patients, while one patient had a close epidemiological link to the virus. All patients achieved full recovery following immunomodulatory therapy. <b>Conclusions</b>: This case series underscores that ataxia may be an atypical symptom associated with TM. Furthermore, there was a notable distinction between the clinical presentation and neuroradiological findings.

40564150,Analysis of Energy Metabolism and Lipid Spatial Distribution in Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy Revealed by MALDI-MSI.,"<b>Background:</b> Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a major cause of neonatal death and neurodevelopmental disorders, and its pathological mechanisms are closely related to disturbed energy metabolism and lipid remodeling. Exploring the spatial heterogeneity of metabolomics is essential to analyze the pathological process of HIE. <b>Methods:</b> In this study, we established a neonatal mouse hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) model by the modified Rice method, and analyzed various metabolic pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, purine metabolism, and lipid metabolism in the ischemic edema area, with contralateral and control brain tissues using matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) with a spatial resolution of 50 μm. <b>Results:</b> In the HIBD model, key metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (citrate, succinate, L-glutamate, glucose, aspartate, and glutamine) were significantly enriched in the edematous area compared with the control (fold change: 1.52-2.82), which suggests a blockage of mitochondrial function; ATP/ADP/AMP levels were reduced by 53-73% in the edematous area, and xanthine was abnormally accumulated in the hippocampus of the affected side, suggesting energy depletion and altered purine metabolism; lipid remodeling showed regional specificity: some unsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid, were abnormally accumulated in the hippocampus. In contrast, pentadecanoic acid levels were reduced across the entire brain in the HIBD model, with a more pronounced decrease in the ipsilateral hippocampus, suggesting impaired membrane stability. <b>Conclusions:</b> The neonatal mouse HIBD model exhibits reprogramming of energy metabolism, characterized by a blockage in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and ATP depletion, along with an abnormal spatial distribution of lipids. By targeting xanthine metabolic pathways, restoring mitochondrial function, and intervening in region-specific lipid remodeling, brain energy homeostasis may be improved and neurological damage attenuated.

40564109,Advances in Autophagy-Lysosomal Pathway and Neurodegeneration via Brain-Gut Axis.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> The autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) is crucial for neuronal health by clearing misfolded proteins and damaged organelles. While much research has focused on ALP dysfunction in the central nervous system, new evidence shows its importance in the gut, where it affects neurodegeneration via the gut-brain axis. Past reviews have mainly studied the ALP's direct neuroprotective effects or the gut microbiota's role in neurodegeneration separately. However, the two-way relationship between the ALP and the gut microbiota in neurodegenerative diseases is not well understood. We combine the latest findings on the ALP's role in gut health, microbial imbalance, and neuroinflammation, providing a comprehensive view of their combined effects in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. <b>Methods:</b> This narrative review synthesizes evidence from preclinical, clinical, and translational studies (2014-2025) to explore the interplay between the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) and the gut-brain axis in neurodegeneration. The literature was identified via PubMed and Web of Science using search terms including autophagy, lysosome, gut microbiota, neurodegeneration, and gut-brain axis, with additional manual screening of reference lists. The inclusion criteria prioritized studies elucidating molecular mechanisms (e.g., ALP-microbiota crosstalk), while excluding case reports or non-peer-reviewed sources. <b>Results:</b> The gut-brain axis facilitates bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain through neural, immune, and metabolic pathways. Autophagy dysfunction may disrupt intestinal homeostasis, promote gut microbiota dysbiosis, and trigger chronic neuroinflammation, ultimately accelerating neurodegeneration.

40564077,"Gut Feelings: How Microbes, Diet, and Host Immunity Shape Disease.","The human gut microbiome is intricately linked to systemic and organ-specific immune responses and is highly responsive to dietary modulation. As metagenomic techniques enable in-depth study of an ever-growing number of gut microbial species, it has become increasingly feasible to decipher the specific functions of the gut microbiome and how they may be modulated by diet. Diet exerts both supportive and selective pressures on the gut microbiome by regulating a multitude of factors, including energy density, macronutrient and micronutrient content, and circadian rhythm. The microbiome, in turn, contributes to local and systemic immune responses by providing colonization resistance against pathogens, shaping immune cell activity and differentiation, and facilitating the production of bioactive metabolites. Emerging research has strengthened the connections between the gut microbiome and cardiometabolic disorders (e.g., cardiovascular disease, obesity, type-2 diabetes), autoimmune conditions (e.g., type-1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease), respiratory disease, chronic kidney and liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and neurological disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, depressive disorders).

40563990,"Palmitoylethanolamide: A Multifunctional Molecule for Neuroprotection, Chronic Pain, and Immune Modulation.","Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an endogenous lipid mediator belonging to the N-acyl-ethanolamine family, widely recognized for its multifaceted effects on neuroprotection, chronic pain management, and immune modulation. As a naturally occurring compound, PEA plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis under conditions of cellular stress and inflammation. Its pharmacological effects are primarily mediated through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-α) activation, alongside indirect modulation of cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, as well as interactions with novel targets such as GPR55 and TRPV1. These molecular mechanisms underpin its broad therapeutic potential, particularly in the management of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders, pain syndromes, and immune dysregulation. A major advancement in PEA research has been the development of ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide (umPEA), which significantly enhances its bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy by facilitating better tissue absorption and interaction with key molecular pathways. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that umPEA is particularly effective in reducing neuroinflammation, stabilizing mast cells, and enhancing endocannabinoid system activity, making it a promising candidate for integrative approaches in neuropsychiatric and chronic inflammatory diseases. Given its well-established safety profile, umPEA represents an attractive alternative or adjunct to conventional anti-inflammatory and analgesic therapies.

40563900,Role of C-Jun N-Terminal Kinases on a Stressed Epithelium: Time for Testing Isoform Specificity.,"Biological, physiological, and psychological stressors cause a ""stress response"" in our bodies. Stressors that are sensorily perceived (either acute or chronic) trigger hormonal responses from the sympathetic nervous system-the SAM and HPA axis-that effect intended organs to alert the individual. Other stressors have a direct effect on the target organ(s) of the body-e.g., physical injury and wounds, toxins, ionizing, and UV radiation. Both kinds of stressors change cell equilibrium, often leading to reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and cellular damage. Among the signaling pathways involved in fighting these stressors, the c-Jun-N-terminal kinases (JNK) respond to diverse kinds of stressors.

It results from ethanol exposure during pregnancy, leading to considerable physical, neurodevelopmental, behavioral, and cognitive deficits. The exact mechanism is not well understood. Recently, considerable attention has been focused on the influence of gut microbiome on brain development through the gut-brain axis. Changes in the gut microbiome resulting from ethanol exposure may contribute to the pathology of FASD, potentially involving neuroinflammation. This literature review summarizes the existing research and primary animal studies on the impact of early ethanol exposure on the gut microbiome, neuroinflammation, brain development, and behavioral consequences. The evidence suggests that early ethanol exposure alters the gut microbiome, which may induce neuroinflammation, brain damage, and cognitive impairment.

40563824,An Updated and Comprehensive Review Exploring the Gut-Brain Axis in Neurodegenerative Disorders and Neurotraumas: Implications for Therapeutic Strategies.,"The gut-brain axis (GBA) refers to the biochemical bidirectional communication between the central nervous system (CNS) and the gastrointestinal tract, linking brain and gut functions. It comprises a complex network of interactions involving the endocrine, immune, autonomic, and enteric nervous systems. The balance of this bidirectional pathway depends on the composition of the gut microbiome and its metabolites. While the causes of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) vary, the gut microbiome plays a crucial role in their development and prognosis. NDDs are often associated with an inflammation-related gut microbiome. However, restoring balance to the gut microbiome and reducing inflammation may have therapeutic benefits. In particular, introducing short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, key metabolites that support gut homeostasis, can help counteract the inflammatory microbiome. This strong pathological link between the gut and NDDs underscores the gut-brain axis (GBA) as a promising target for therapeutic intervention. This review, by scrutinizing the more recent original research articles published in PubMed (MEDLINE) database, emphasizes the emerging notion that GBA is an equally important pathological marker for neurological movement disorders, particularly in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease and neurotraumatic disorders such as traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury.

40563817,Shaping the Future of Psychiatric Neurosurgery: From Connectomic Precision to Technological Integration.,"Psychiatric neurosurgery is undergoing a profound transformation, propelled by advances in neurotechnology, connectomics, and personalized medicine. Once controversial, surgical interventions are now guided by detailed functional brain mapping and precise neuromodulation techniques, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), which offer therapeutic options for patients with severe, treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders. This manuscript reviews the current techniques, including lesion-based procedures and DBS, and explores their mechanisms of action, from synaptic plasticity to large-scale network modulation. It highlights recent progress in neuroimaging, connectomic targeting, and artificial intelligence applications for surgical planning and the prediction of treatment responses. Ethical considerations-including informed consent, identity, and long-term follow-up-are critically examined in light of these advances. Furthermore, the growing role of minimally invasive procedures and wearable integrated neurotechnologies is discussed as part of a shift toward dynamic and adaptive interventions.

40563811,Sleep Deprivation and Alzheimer's Disease: A Review of the Bidirectional Interactions and Therapeutic Potential of Omega-3.,"Sleep is essential for physical and mental health, playing a critical role in memory consolidation, behavioral stability, and the regulation of immune and metabolic functions. The incidence of sleep disorders, particularly sleep deprivation (SD), increases with age and is prevalent in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nearly 40% of AD patients experience significant chronic sleep impairments. The clinical distinction between late-life sleep disorders and AD is often challenging due to overlapping symptoms, including cognitive decline and behavioral impairments. Although the exact causal relationship between SD and AD remains complex and multifaceted, strong evidence suggests a bidirectional link, with AD patients frequently exhibiting disrupted sleep architecture, reduced slow-wave activity, and shorter total sleep duration. On a pathophysiological level, SD contributes to neuroinflammation, amyloid-β plaque deposition, and tau tangles, which are key features of AD. Current treatments, such as sedatives and antidepressants, often have limitations, including inconsistent efficacy, dependency risks, and poor long-term outcomes/recurrence, highlighting the need for safer and more effective alternatives. This review examines the interplay between SD and AD and proposes omega (n)-3 fatty acids (FAs) as a potential therapeutic intervention. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that n-3 supplementation may improve sleep onset/quality, reduce neuroinflammation, support synaptic function, and decrease amyloid-β aggregation, thereby alleviating early AD-related neurological changes. Given their safety profile and neuroprotective effects, n-3 FAs represent a promising strategy for managing the comorbidity of sleep disorders in AD.",Brain sciences,2025.0,Nasar Ullah Khan Niazi; Jiahui Jiang; Haiyan Ou; Ruiye Chen; Zhiyou Yang,sleep essential physical mental health play critical role memory consolidation behavioral stability regulation immune metabolic function incidence sleep disorder particularly sleep deprivation sd increase age prevalent neurodegenerative psychiatric disorder alzheimer disease ad nearly 40 ad patient experience significant chronic sleep impairment clinical distinction late life sleep disorder ad challenge overlap symptom include cognitive decline behavioral impairment exact causal relationship sd ad remain complex multifaceted strong evidence suggest bidirectional link ad patient frequently exhibit disrupt sleep architecture reduce slow wave activity short total sleep duration pathophysiological level sd contribute neuroinflammation amyloid β plaque deposition tau tangle key feature ad current treatment sedative antidepressant limitation include inconsistent efficacy dependency risk poor long term outcome recurrence highlight need safe effective alternative review examine interplay sd ad propose omega n)-3 fatty acid fas potential therapeutic intervention preclinical clinical study suggest n-3 supplementation improve sleep onset quality reduce neuroinflammation support synaptic function decrease amyloid β aggregation alleviate early ad relate neurological change give safety profile neuroprotective effect n-3 fas represent promising strategy manage comorbidity sleep disorder ad

Unravelling the Triumvirate of Selfhood in Pathological Consciousness.","In this conceptual review, we explore how alterations in the configuration and expression of the three core aspects of experiential Selfhood-'Self,' 'Me', and 'I'-both reflect and shape an individual's susceptibility to neuropsychopathology. Drawing on empirical neurophenomenological evidence and theoretical insights, we examine a range of psychiatric and neurological disorders through the lens of the Selfhood triumvirate. Our findings indicate that, despite variations in the expression of Selfhood aspects across different pathologies, their proportional configuration remains remarkably stable in most conditions, with the 'Self' aspect consistently dominant, followed by the 'Me' aspect, and finally the 'I' aspect. This stability suggests a fundamental neurophenomenological hierarchy in Selfhood organization, which seems to be disrupted only in extreme cases such as vegetative (unresponsive) states and also schizophrenia. Ultimately, we propose that all neuropsychopathologies are best understood as disorders of Selfhood, where disruptions in the dynamic balance and configuration of the 'Self', 'Me', and 'I' aspects accompany neurophenomenological manifestations in distinct dysfunctions and pathologies.",Brain sciences,2025.0,Alexander A Fingelkurts; Andrew A Fingelkurts,conceptual review explore alteration configuration expression core aspect experiential selfhood-'self i'-both reflect shape individual susceptibility neuropsychopathology draw empirical neurophenomenological evidence theoretical insight examine range psychiatric neurological disorder lens selfhood triumvirate finding indicate despite variation expression selfhood aspect different pathology proportional configuration remain remarkably stable condition self aspect consistently dominant follow aspect finally aspect stability suggest fundamental neurophenomenological hierarchy selfhood organization disrupt extreme case vegetative unresponsive state schizophrenia ultimately propose neuropsychopathologie well understand disorder selfhood disruption dynamic balance configuration self aspect accompany neurophenomenological manifestation distinct dysfunction pathology

40563755,The Role of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in Chronic Shoulder Pain: A Scoping Review.,"Chronic shoulder pain is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder often associated with central sensitisation, which limits the effectiveness of conventional therapies. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has emerged as a non-invasive neuromodulatory intervention to modulate cortical excitability and potentially improve pain and functional outcomes. This scoping review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) framework and PRISMA-ScR guidelines. A systematic search was conducted across MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Scopus, PEDro, and Web of Science to identify studies evaluating the effects of tDCS on pain and function in adults with rotator cuff disorders, myofascial pain syndrome (MPS), or subacromial pain syndrome (SAPS). Data were extracted and synthesised qualitatively. Four studies met the inclusion criteria. tDCS demonstrated variable efficacy: some trials reported no additional benefit when used alongside corticosteroid injections or sensorimotor training (e.g., SAPS and rotator cuff tendinopathy), while others showed enhanced pain reduction and functional gains, particularly in MPS. Targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) appeared more effective than stimulating the primary motor cortex (M1) in modulating pain. Functional improvements were generally observed, though not consistently superior to sham interventions. Preliminary evidence suggests that tDCS may represent a promising adjunctive treatment for chronic shoulder pain, particularly in MPS. However, due to the limited number of studies and heterogeneity in methods, conclusions should be interpreted with caution. However, heterogeneity in study protocols, stimulation targets, and patient populations limits conclusive recommendations.

40563746,Rapid Eye Movements in Sleep Furnish a Unique Probe into the Ontogenetic and Phylogenetic Development of the Visual Brain: Implications for Autism Research.,"With positron emission tomography followed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we demonstrated that rapid eye movements (REMs) in sleep are saccades that scan dream imagery. The brain ""sees"" essentially the same way while awake and while dreaming in REM sleep. As expected, an event-related fMRI study (events = REMs) showed activation time-locked to REMs in sleep (""REM-locked"" activation) in the oculomotor circuit that controls saccadic eye movements and visual attention. More crucially, the fMRI study provided a series of unexpected findings, including REM-locked multisensory integration. REMs in sleep index the processing of endogenous visual information and the hierarchical generation of dream imagery through multisensory integration. The neural processes concurrent with REMs overlap extensively with those reported to be atypical in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Studies on ASD have shown atypical visual processing and multisensory integration, emerging early in infancy and subsequently developing into autistic symptoms. MRI studies of infants at high risk for ASD are typically conducted during natural sleep. Simply timing REMs may improve the accuracy of early detection and identify markers for stratification in heterogeneous ASD patients. REMs serve as a task-free probe useful for studying both infants and animals, who cannot comply with conventional visual activation tasks. Note that REM-probe studies would be easier to implement in early infancy because REM sleep, which is markedly preponderant in the last trimester of pregnancy, is still pronounced in early infancy. The brain may practice seeing the world during REM sleep in utero before birth. The REM-probe controls the level of attention across both the lifespan and typical-atypical neurodevelopment. Longitudinal REM-probe studies may elucidate how the brain develops the ability to ""see"" and how this goes awry in autism. REMs in sleep may allow a straightforward comparison of animal and human data. REM-probe studies of animal models of autism have great potential.

40563742,Extracellular Vesicles and Purinergic Signaling in Alzheimer's Disease-Joining Forces for Novel Therapeutic Approach.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), are a global problem affecting millions of people. Thanks to years of research and huge efforts, it has been possible to discover the pathophysiological changes accompanying Alzheimer's disease at the cellular level. It turns out that the formation of amyloid-beta plaques and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein in the brain play a key role in disease development. Purinergic signaling (PS) is implicated in the pathophysiology of several disorders in the central nervous system, and recent findings link some disturbances in PS with Alzheimer's disease. The primary objective of our review is to comprehensively explore and identify key purinergic signaling targets that hold therapeutic potential in the treatment of patients suffering from the disease. In particular, we focus on the dual role of purinergic compounds and extracellular vesicles (EVs), which have emerged as critical components in cellular communication and disease modulation. The extracellular vesicles that are naturally released by various cells fulfill the role of communication tools, also by harnessing the purinergic compounds. In this context, our review presents a thorough and integrative analysis of how extracellular vesicles can influence purinergic signaling and how this interaction might be leveraged to develop novel, targeted treatment strategies. Ultimately, this line of research may lead to innovative therapeutic approaches that are not only effective in slowing or halting disease progression but also demonstrate a high degree of biocompatibility and safety for the human organism.",Brain sciences,2025.0,Julita Lewandowska; Jakub Majewski; Katarzyna Roszek,neurodegenerative disease include alzheimer disease ad global problem affect million people thank year research huge effort possible discover pathophysiological change accompany alzheimer disease cellular level turn formation amyloid beta plaque hyperphosphorylation tau protein brain play key role disease development purinergic signaling ps implicate pathophysiology disorder central nervous system recent finding link disturbance ps alzheimer disease primary objective review comprehensively explore identify key purinergic signal target hold therapeutic potential treatment patient suffer disease particular focus dual role purinergic compound extracellular vesicle evs emerge critical component cellular communication disease modulation extracellular vesicle naturally release cell fulfill role communication tool harness purinergic compound context review present thorough integrative analysis extracellular vesicle influence purinergic signaling interaction leveraged develop novel target treatment strategy ultimately line research lead innovative therapeutic approach effective slow halting disease progression demonstrate high degree biocompatibility safety human organism

This systematic review aims to evaluate the short-term and long-term psychiatric effects of STN-DBS and identify influencing factors. <b>Methods</b>: A systematic literature search (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase; 2015-2024) was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Studies examining psychiatric effects of STN-DBS in PD or OCD, reporting quantitative/qualitative psychiatric measures, and specifying stimulation parameters were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for observational studies and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). <b>Results</b>: A total of 16 studies met the inclusion criteria, with sample sizes from 10 to 149 patients and short- to long-term follow-ups (up to 17 years). Short-term effects included transient hypomania, euphoria, increased impulsivity (especially with medial STN stimulation), and sometimes anxiety reduction. Long-term effects showed a tendency towards apathy and depression (apathy increased significantly in one large cohort), particularly linked to ventromedial STN stimulation or dopaminergic medication reduction. Impulse control disorders (ICDs) improved long-term in one study following medication reduction, while impulsivity slightly worsened in another. Verbal fluency decline was commonly reported, though global cognition often remained stable. Psychiatric outcomes (mood/apathy, attention/memory) depended on stimulation location within STN subregions. Higher total electrical energy delivered (TEED) correlated with depressive trait shifts in one study. <b>Conclusions</b>: STN-DBS has complex psychiatric consequences. Electrode positioning, stimulation parameters (including location within STN subregions and possibly TEED), and medication adjustments significantly influence outcomes. Careful patient selection, preoperative psychiatric screening, optimized programming targeting specific STN subregions, and cautious medication management are essential to minimize psychiatric risks while maximizing therapeutic benefits for motor and OCD symptoms.",Brain sciences,2025.0,Mattia Vittorio Pomes; Giordano D'Urso; Ilaria Bove; Luigi Maria Cavallo; Lorenzo Della Ragione; Carmela Palmiero; Francesco Perrotta; Felice Esposito; Teresa Somma,< b > background objectives</b > deep brain stimulation dbs subthalamic nucleus stn widely intervention parkinson disease pd obsessive compulsive disorder ocd motor ocd symptom benefit establish increase evidence highlight psychiatric effect underlie mechanism involve stimulation parameter electrode positioning medication adjustment systematic review aim evaluate short term long term psychiatric effect stn dbs identify influence factor < b > methods</b > systematic literature search pubmed scopus web science embase 2015 2024 conduct follow prisma guideline study examine psychiatric effect stn dbs pd ocd report quantitative qualitative psychiatric measure specify stimulation parameter include risk bias assess newcastle ottawa scale nos observational study cochrane risk bias tool randomize control trial rcts < b > results</b > total 16 study meet inclusion criterion sample size 10 149 patient short- long term follow up 17 year short term effect include transient hypomania euphoria increased impulsivity especially medial stn stimulation anxiety reduction long term effect show tendency apathy depression apathy increase significantly large cohort particularly link ventromedial stn stimulation dopaminergic medication reduction impulse control disorder icds improve long term study follow medication reduction impulsivity slightly worsen verbal fluency decline commonly report global cognition remain stable psychiatric outcome mood apathy attention memory depend stimulation location stn subregion high total electrical energy deliver teed correlate depressive trait shift study < b > conclusions</b > stn dbs complex psychiatric consequence electrode positioning stimulation parameter include location stn subregion possibly teed medication adjustment significantly influence outcome careful patient selection preoperative psychiatric screening optimize programming target specific stn subregion cautious medication management essential minimize psychiatric risk maximize therapeutic benefit motor ocd symptom

40563541,Ankyrin-G and Its Binding Partners in Neurons: Orchestrating the Molecular Structure of the Axon Initial Segment.,"The axon initial segment (AIS) is a specialized subcellular domain that plays an essential role in action potential initiation and the diffusion barrier. A key organizer of the AIS is Ankyrin-G, a scaffolding protein responsible for clustering voltage-gated ion channels, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), and cytoskeletal components at this critical neuronal domain. Recent proteomic analyses have revealed a complex network of proteins in the AIS, emphasizing Ankyrin-G's central role in its molecular architecture. This review discusses new findings in the study of AIS-associated proteins. It explains how Ankyrin-G and its binding partners (such as ion channels, CAMs, spectrins, actin, and microtubule-associated proteins including end-binding protein 3, tripartite motif-containing protein 46, and calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein 2) organize their structure. Understanding the dynamic regulation and molecular interactions within the AIS offers insights into neuronal excitability and reveals potential therapeutic targets for axonal dysfunction-related diseases. Through these dynamic interactions, Ankyrin-G ensures the proper alignment and dense clustering of key channel complexes, thereby maintaining the AIS's distinctive molecular and functional identity. By further unraveling the complexity of Ankyrin-G's interactome, our understanding of AIS formation, maintenance, and plasticity will be considerably enhanced, contributing to the elucidation of the pathogenesis of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.",Biomolecules,2025.0,Xiaowei Zhu; Yanyan Yu; Zhuqian Jiang; Yoshinori Otani; Masashi Fujitani,axon initial segment ais specialized subcellular domain play essential role action potential initiation diffusion barrier key organizer ais ankyrin g scaffold protein responsible cluster voltage gate ion channel cell adhesion molecule cams cytoskeletal component critical neuronal domain recent proteomic analysis reveal complex network protein ais emphasize ankyrin g central role molecular architecture review discuss new finding study ais associate protein explain ankyrin g bind partner ion channel cam spectrin actin microtubule associate protein include end bind protein 3 tripartite motif contain protein 46 calmodulin regulate spectrin associate protein 2 organize structure understand dynamic regulation molecular interaction ais offer insight neuronal excitability reveal potential therapeutic target axonal dysfunction relate disease dynamic interaction ankyrin g ensure proper alignment dense clustering key channel complex maintain ais distinctive molecular functional identity unravel complexity ankyrin g interactome understanding ais formation maintenance plasticity considerably enhance contribute elucidation pathogenesis neurological neuropsychiatric disorder
40563525,Cardiac Glycosides: From Natural Defense Molecules to Emerging Therapeutic Agents.,"Cardiac glycosides (CGs), a class of plant- and animal-derived compounds historically used to treat heart failure, have garnered renewed interest for their diverse pharmacological properties beyond Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (NKA) inhibition. Recent studies reveal that CGs modulate key signaling pathways-such as NF-κB, PI3K/Akt, JAK/STAT, and MAPK-affecting processes central to cancer, viral infections, immune regulation, and neurodegeneration. In cancer, CGs induce multiple forms of regulated cell death, including apoptosis, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, and immunogenic cell death, while also inhibiting angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and cell cycle progression. They demonstrate broad-spectrum antiviral activity by disrupting viral entry, replication, and mRNA processing in viruses such as HSV, HIV, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. Immunologically, CGs regulate Th17 differentiation via RORγ signaling, although both inhibitory and agonistic effects have been reported. In the nervous system, CGs modulate neuroinflammation, support synaptic plasticity, and improve cognitive function in models of Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis. Despite their therapeutic potential, clinical translation is hindered by narrow therapeutic indices and systemic toxicity. Advances in drug design and nanocarrier-based delivery are critical to unlocking CGs' full potential as multi-target agents for complex diseases.

40563512,A Single-Chain Variable Fragment Antibody Alleviates Inflammation and Apoptosis of Neurons by Inhibiting Tau Aggregation.,"Tau pathology is one of the main pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Intracellular Tau may be released to the extracellular space upon neuron degeneration, where it has the potential to be toxic to other neurons. The propagation of Tau pathology, mediated by extracellular Tau aggregates, may underlie the pathogenesis of AD. Antibody therapies targeting Tau proteins are, therefore, considered highly promising. In this study, the cytotoxicity of extracellular Tau aggregates on SH-SY5Y cells was examined. The effect of extracellular Tau aggregates on intracellular Tau aggregation was also studied using a FRET-based assay. The extracellular Tau aggregates were found to cause intracellular Tau aggregation after entering the cells; meanwhile, ROS (reactive oxygen species) induced by Tau aggregates facilitated this process. A single-chain variable fragment antibody (scFv T1) inhibits Tau aggregation both extracellularly and intracellularly. ScFv T1 also inhibited the accumulation of ROS and alleviated the inflammation and apoptosis induced by Tau aggregates. These findings could provide experimental support for the study of neurotoxicity and related mechanisms of extracellular Tau aggregates, in addition to providing insights into the development of novel therapeutic agents to treat AD.",Biomolecules,2025.0,Zongbao Wang; Jingye Lin; Peipei Chang; Mingzhu Sun; Sen Li,tau pathology main pathological feature alzheimer disease ad intracellular tau release extracellular space neuron degeneration potential toxic neuron propagation tau pathology mediate extracellular tau aggregate underlie pathogenesis ad antibody therapy target tau protein consider highly promising study cytotoxicity extracellular tau aggregate sh sy5y cell examine effect extracellular tau aggregate intracellular tau aggregation study fret base assay extracellular tau aggregate find cause intracellular tau aggregation enter cell ros reactive oxygen species induce tau aggregate facilitate process single chain variable fragment antibody scfv t1 inhibit tau aggregation extracellularly intracellularly scfv t1 inhibit accumulation ros alleviate inflammation apoptosis induce tau aggregate finding provide experimental support study neurotoxicity related mechanism extracellular tau aggregate addition provide insight development novel therapeutic agent treat ad
40563509,Positive Effects of (+)-Epicatechin on Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury Recovery.,"Neurological damage from traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) results in a grade of disability ranging from mild to severe motor and sensory dysfunction. It occurs more frequently in men of productive age. Treatment essentially consists of anti-inflammatories and rehabilitation. Other treatments are only partially effective, and inadequate treatment and secondary conditions often cause premature mortality. The search for pharmacological approaches is a continuous effort. This study aimed to assess the effects of a natural compound on spinal cord injury (SCI) as an alternative damage prevention maneuver. We evaluated the protective effects of the flavanol (+)-epicatechin (EC) in a rat model of moderate trauma-induced SCI on protein markers of damage events. The results showed that EC induced significant protection against SCI. No changes were found in angiopoietin-1, beclin-1, myelin basic protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilament heavy polypeptide, and neuronal nuclear antigen after the injury, suggesting that damage progression was impeded.

40563502,Long-Term Exercise Mitigates Energy Expenditure and Inflammatory Responses Induced by Sleep Deprivation in Mice.,"<b>Background</b>: Sleep deprivation (SD), defined as the disruption or loss of normal sleep, negatively affects energy metabolism, immune function, and gut microbiota in both humans and animals. Although SD has detrimental effects, it is often unavoidable due to work or study demands. Exercise has been shown to improve sleep quality, regulate metabolism, and enhance immune function. However, whether exercise can mitigate the adverse effects of unavoidable SD remains unclear. <b>Methods</b>: To explore the protective effects of exercise against SD-induced gut microbiota and metabolic dysfunction, mice were randomly assigned to four groups: control (CTR), exercise (EXE), SD, and exercise + SD (EXE + SD). Inflammatory markers and gut microbiota composition were analyzed to assess the impacts of SD and exercise interventions. <b>Results</b>: The inflammatory levels and energy metabolism in SD mice were significantly increased compared to those in CTR mice. Compared with SD mice, EXE + SD mice had a more stable gut microbiota structure and higher butyrate levels. Meanwhile, the inflammatory response caused by SD was also inhibited by exercise preconditioning. Both lipopolysaccharide inhibitors injection and butyrate supplementation can partially alleviate the elevation of inflammatory response and energy metabolism caused by SD. <b>Conclusion</b>: The inflammation and energy metabolism disorders in mice caused by SD can be inhibited by exercise preconditioning through stabilizing the structure of gut microbiota. This protective effect is highly likely related to the increase in butyric acid levels caused by exercise.",Biomolecules,2025.0,Tian-Shu Zheng; Xin-Ran Gao; Chen Gu; Yu-Ning Ru; Rui-Ping Xu; Yu-Hang Yang; De-Hua Wang,< b > background</b > sleep deprivation sd define disruption loss normal sleep negatively affect energy metabolism immune function gut microbiota human animal sd detrimental effect unavoidable work study demand exercise show improve sleep quality regulate metabolism enhance immune function exercise mitigate adverse effect unavoidable sd remain unclear < b > methods</b > explore protective effect exercise sd induce gut microbiota metabolic dysfunction mouse randomly assign group control ctr exercise exe sd exercise + sd exe + sd inflammatory marker gut microbiota composition analyze assess impact sd exercise intervention < b > results</b > inflammatory level energy metabolism sd mouse significantly increase compare ctr mouse compare sd mouse exe + sd mouse stable gut microbiota structure high butyrate level inflammatory response cause sd inhibit exercise precondition lipopolysaccharide inhibitor injection butyrate supplementation partially alleviate elevation inflammatory response energy metabolism cause sd < b > conclusion</b > inflammation energy metabolism disorder mouse cause sd inhibit exercise precondition stabilize structure gut microbiota protective effect highly likely relate increase butyric acid level cause exercise

While extracellular amyloid plaques are well-studied, increasing evidence highlights intracellular Aβ42 as an early and toxic driver of disease progression. In this study, we present a novel, Generative AI-based drug design approach to promote targeted degradation of Aβ42 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), using E3 ligase-directed molecular glues. We systematically evaluated the ternary complex formation potential of Aβ42 with three E3 ligases (CRBN, VHL, and MDM2) through structure-based modeling, ADMET screening, and docking. We then developed a Ligase-Conditioned Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder (LC-JT-VAE) to generate ligase-specific small molecules, incorporating protein sequence embeddings and torsional angle-aware molecular graphs. Our results demonstrate that this generative model can produce chemically valid, novel, and target-specific molecular glues capable of facilitating Aβ42 degradation.

40563471,Cytoskeletal Proteins and Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis: Focusing on the Interplay with Tau Pathology.,"The aggregation of Tau protein into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is associated with cognitive decline. Recent studies have revealed that neuronal cytoskeletal instability drives early AD pathogenesis. The physiological interaction between tau and the microtubule (MT) is crucial for maintaining axonal transport and stability. However, aberrant post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the MT binding domain-such as phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitination-trigger tau dissociation, causing microtubule collapse, transport deficits, and synaptic dysfunction. MT dysregulation also affects actin/cofilin-mediated dendritic spine destabilization and causes the hyperplasia of the glial intermediate filament, which exacerbates neuroinflammation and synaptic toxicity. This review systematically explores the functions of neuronal cytoskeletons, deciphers the molecular crosstalk between tau pathology and cytoskeletal remodeling, and proposes multi-target therapeutic strategies to restore cytoskeletal homeostasis, thereby providing novel perspectives for precision interventions in AD.",Biomolecules,2025.0,Gege Jiang; Guanfeng Xie; Xiaoyi Li; Jing Xiong,aggregation tau protein neurofibrillary tangle nfts hallmark alzheimer disease ad associate cognitive decline recent study reveal neuronal cytoskeletal instability drive early ad pathogenesis physiological interaction tau microtubule mt crucial maintain axonal transport stability aberrant post translational modification ptm mt bind domain phosphorylation acetylation ubiquitination trigger tau dissociation cause microtubule collapse transport deficit synaptic dysfunction mt dysregulation affect actin cofilin mediate dendritic spine destabilization cause hyperplasia glial intermediate filament exacerbate neuroinflammation synaptic toxicity review systematically explore function neuronal cytoskeleton decipher molecular crosstalk tau pathology cytoskeletal remodeling propose multi target therapeutic strategy restore cytoskeletal homeostasis provide novel perspective precision intervention ad
40563464,The Role and Pathogenesis of Tau Protein in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a predominant neurodegenerative disorder, is clinically characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration and behavioral deficits. An in-depth understanding of the pathogenesis and neuropathology of AD is essential for the development of effective treatments and early diagnosis techniques. The neuropathological signature of AD involves two hallmark lesions: intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates and extracellular senile plaques containing amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide depositions. Although Aβ-centric research has dominated AD investigations over the past three decades, pharmacological interventions targeting Aβ pathology have failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy. Tau, a microtubule-associated protein predominantly localized to neuronal axons, orchestrates microtubule stabilization and axonal transport through dynamic tubulin interactions under physiological conditions. In AD pathogenesis, however, tau undergoes pathogenic post-translational modifications (PTMs), encompassing hyperphosphorylation, lysine acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and glycosylation. These PTM-driven alterations induce microtubule network disintegration, mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic impairment, and neuroinflammatory cascades, ultimately culminating in irreversible neurodegeneration and progressive cognitive decline. This review synthesizes contemporary advances in tau PTM research and delineates their mechanistic contributions to AD pathogenesis, thereby establishing a framework for biomarker discovery, targeted therapeutic development, and precision medicine approaches in tauopathies.

40563456,Are Cannabis-Based Medicines a Useful Treatment for Neuropathic Pain? A Systematic Review.,"Neuropathic pain is a chronic disorder that arises from damaged or malfunctioning nerves. Hypersensitivity to stimuli, also known as hyperalgesia, can cause a person to experience pain from non-painful stimuli, termed allodynia. Cannabis-based medicines (CBMs) may provide new treatment options to manage neuropathic pain. A review of the relevant studies was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of CBMs in treating neuropathic pain. Scientific literature was systematically searched from January 2003 to December 2024 using the Web of Science Core Collection, PubMed, and MEDLINE. A total of 22 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified that considered the use of 1',1'-dimethylheptyl-Δ<sup>8</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol-11-oic acid (CT-3), Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC), cannabidiol (CBD), combinations of Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC with CBD, and cannabidivarin for treatment of neuropathic pain. Significant reductions in pain were reported in 15 studies focused on the treatment of multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injuries, diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, HIV-associated sensory neuropathy, peripheral neuropathic pain, complex regional pain syndrome, chronic radicular neuropathic pain, and peripheral neuropathy of the lower extremities. These positive outcomes often adopted personalized and adjusted dosing strategies. By contrast, seven RCTs observed no significant pain relief compared to placebo, although some had minor improvements in secondary outcomes, such as mood and sleep. Collectively, CBM treatments may improve pain scores, but study limitations such as small sample sizes and study durations, high placebo response rates, and trial unblinding because of the psychoactive effects of cannabinoids all hinder data interpretation and the extrapolation to chronic pain conditions. Hence, future RCTs will need to have larger numbers and be more extended studies that explore optimal dosing and delivery methods and identify patient subgroups that are most likely to benefit. While CBMs show potential, their current use balances modest benefits against possible adverse effects and variable outcomes.",Biomolecules,2025.0,Nawaf Almuntashiri; Basma M El Sharazly; Wayne G Carter,"neuropathic pain chronic disorder arise damaged malfunctioning nerve hypersensitivity stimulus know hyperalgesia cause person experience pain non painful stimulus term allodynia cannabis base medicine cbms provide new treatment option manage neuropathic pain review relevant study conduct evaluate effectiveness cbms treat neuropathic pain scientific literature systematically search january 2003 december 2024 web science core collection pubmed medline total 22 randomize control trial rcts identify consider use 1',1'-dimethylheptyl δ < sup>8</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol-11 oic acid ct-3 δ < sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol δ < sup>9</sup>-thc cannabidiol cbd combination δ < sup>9</sup>-thc cbd cannabidivarin treatment neuropathic pain significant reduction pain report 15 study focus treatment multiple sclerosis spinal cord injury diabetic neuropathy postherpetic neuralgia hiv associate sensory neuropathy peripheral neuropathic pain complex regional pain syndrome chronic radicular neuropathic pain peripheral neuropathy low extremity positive outcome adopt personalized adjust dose strategy contrast seven rct observe significant pain relief compare placebo minor improvement secondary outcome mood sleep collectively cbm treatment improve pain score study limitation small sample size study duration high placebo response rate trial unblinding psychoactive effect cannabinoid hinder datum interpretation extrapolation chronic pain condition future rct need large number extended study explore optimal dosing delivery method identify patient subgroup likely benefit cbm potential current use balance modest benefit possible adverse effect variable outcome"
40563446,"Non-Coding RNAs: lncRNA, piRNA, and snoRNA as Robust Plasma Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia worldwide. As current diagnostic approaches remain limited in sensitivity and accessibility, there is a critical need for novel, non-invasive biomarkers aiding early detection. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), have emerged as promising candidates due to their regulatory roles in gene expression and association with diseases. In this study, we systematically profiled ncRNA expression from RNA sequencing data of 48 AD and 22 control blood tissue samples, aiming to evaluate their utility as biomarkers for AD classification. Differential expression analysis revealed widespread dysregulation of lncRNAs and piRNAs, with over 5000 lncRNAs and nearly 1000 piRNAs significantly upregulated in AD. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified multiple ncRNA modules associated with the AD phenotype. Using supervised machine learning approaches, we evaluated the diagnostic potential of ncRNA expression profiles, including single-gene, multi-gene, and module-level models. Random Forest models trained on individual genes identified 121 ncRNAs with AUROC > 0.8.

40563439,Increased [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 Uptake in the Skeletal Muscle of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> Mice: A New Potential of Translocator Protein 18 kDa Imaging in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,"The skeletal muscle has been proposed to contribute to the progressive loss of motor neurons typical of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, this mechanism has not yet been clarified due to the lack of suitable imaging tools. Here, we aimed to verify whether PET imaging of the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) can detect a muscular abnormality in an experimental model of ALS. In vivo biodistribution and kinetics of [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 were analyzed in skeletal muscle and brain of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> transgenic mice and in wildtype (WT) littermates. Both cohorts were divided into three groups (n = 6 each) to be studied at 60, 90 and 120 days. After microPET imaging, animals were sacrificed to evaluate inflammatory infiltrates by hematoxylin/eosin staining and TSPO expression by immunohistochemistry and Western blot in both quadriceps and brain. [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 uptake was higher in the skeletal muscles of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> than in WT mice in the preclinical phase (60 and 90 days) and further increased up to the symptomatic late stage (120 days). Inflammatory cells were absent in the quadriceps of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice whose myocytes, instead, showed a progressive increase in TSPO expression with advancing age. By contrast, brain tracer uptake and TSPO expression were comparably low in both groups, regardless of age and genotype.

40563435,Serum Npas-4 and Nptx-2 Levels in Alzheimer's Disease: Potential Biomarkers of Synaptic Dysfunction in a Cross-Sectional Study.,"<b>Background:</b> Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal loss. Identifying reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis and disease monitoring remains a critical need. <b>Objective:</b> This study aimed to investigate the serum levels of NPAS-4 (Neuronal PAS Domain Protein 4) and NPTX-2 (Neuronal Pentraxin 2) in patients with Alzheimer's disease, exploring their potential roles in disease pathophysiology and their relationship with lipid parameters. <b>Methods:</b> This was a cross-sectional study that included 63 patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and 56 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Venous blood samples were collected from all participants. NPAS-4 and NPTX-2 levels were measured using the ELISA method, while lipid parameters were analyzed via spectrophotometric techniques. Cognitive assessment was performed using the Standardized Mini-Mental Test (SMMT). Comparative analyses between groups, correlation studies, logistic regression, and ROC analyses were conducted. <b>Results:</b> Serum NPAS-4 and NPTX-2 levels were significantly lower in Alzheimer's patients compared to healthy controls (<i>p</i> < 0.001 and <i>p</i> = 0.001, respectively). Additionally, total cholesterol and LDL levels were lower in the patient group. Logistic regression analysis identified NPAS-4 as an independent risk predictor for Alzheimer's disease (OR = 0.313, <i>p</i> < 0.001). ROC analyses demonstrated that both biomarkers had significant diagnostic discrimination power. However, no significant correlation was found between NPAS-4 and NPTX-2 levels and SMMT scores or lipid parameters. <b>Conclusions:</b> The decreased levels of NPAS-4 and NPTX-2 in Alzheimer's patients may reflect biochemical manifestations of impaired synaptic plasticity.

40563433,Biomarkers and Mental Disorders: A Relevance Analysis Using a Random Forest Algorithm.,"Depression and anxiety are mental health disorders that significantly impact global public health, affecting more than 280 million people with depression and 301 million with anxiety worldwide. These conditions impair individuals' ability to engage in economic and personal activities and can lead to severe outcomes, such as suicide. Current research suggests that inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), play crucial roles in the pathophysiology of these disorders, influencing neurotransmitters. Elevated cortisol levels, typically associated with anxiety, worsen these conditions through dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Additionally, vitamin D deficiency has been linked to reduced production of dopamine and norepinephrine, hormones involved in depressive symptoms. This study utilized the Random Forest machine learning algorithm along with cross-validation to assess the importance of various biomarkers, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF, cortisol, vitamin D, NT-proBNP, CK-MB, troponin, myoglobin, and C-reactive protein (CRP), in volunteers of both sexes diagnosed with mental disorders. A single sample from each of the 96 participants was analyzed, consisting of 50 women and 46 men. The results revealed sex-specific differences in biomarker relevance, with vitamin D, CRP, and D-dimer being the most predictive for depression in men, while IL-6, CRP, and vitamin D were significant in women. For anxiety, vitamin D and myoglobin were important biomarkers in men, while IL-8 and vitamin D were key in women.

40563428,CLSI Validation of Exchangeable Copper Determination in Serum by ICP-MS: A Focus on Alzheimer's Disease and Wilson Disease.,"Copper dyshomeostasis has been implicated in a subset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, characterized by elevated non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (non-Cp Cu). However, traditional methods for estimating non-Cp Cu are indirect and analytically imprecise. This study introduces and validates a direct assay for exchangeable copper (ExcCu) by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), compliant with Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. We performed analytical validation of the ExcCu assay following CLSI protocols (EP5, EP6, EP7, EP9, EP15, and EP28). ExcCu and other copper-related biomarkers were quantified in serum samples from 154 healthy controls, 82 AD patients, and 10 patients with Wilson disease (WD). Diagnostic performance was evaluated via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and inter-method agreement was assessed using Bland-Altman plots. The ExcCu assay demonstrated excellent linearity, precision (CV < 6%), and inter-laboratory reproducibility. Among AD patients, ExcCu levels were significantly elevated compared to controls (<i>p</i> < 0.001). ExcCu distinguished AD from controls with an AUC of 0.80 and a specificity of 95%. Compared to non-Cp Cu, ExcCu yielded no negative values and showed reduced bias. The relative exchangeable copper (REC) index was more effective in differentiating AD from WD (AUC = 0.88). The validated ExcCu assay overcomes the limitations of the traditional non-Cp Cu calculation, offering a reliable biomarker for copper-related AD subtypes. Its high specificity supports its use in patient stratification, potentially contributing to personalized approaches in AD diagnosis and therapy.",Biomolecules,2025.0,Rosanna Squitti; Amit Pal; Irena D Ivanova; Massimo Marianetti; Mauro Rongioletti,copper dyshomeostasis implicate subset alzheimer disease ad patient characterize elevated non ceruloplasmin bind copper non cp cu traditional method estimate non cp cu indirect analytically imprecise study introduce validate direct assay exchangeable copper exccu inductively couple plasma mass spectrometry icp ms compliant clinical laboratory standards institute clsi guideline perform analytical validation exccu assay follow clsi protocol ep5 ep6 ep7 ep9 ep15 ep28 exccu copper relate biomarker quantify serum sample 154 healthy control 82 ad patient 10 patient wilson disease wd diagnostic performance evaluate receiver operating characteristic roc curve analysis inter method agreement assess bland altman plot exccu assay demonstrate excellent linearity precision cv < 6 inter laboratory reproducibility ad patient exccu level significantly elevate compare control < > p</i > < 0.001 exccu distinguish ad control auc 0.80 specificity 95 compare non cp cu exccu yield negative value show reduce bias relative exchangeable copper rec index effective differentiate ad wd auc = 0.88 validate exccu assay overcome limitation traditional non cp cu calculation offer reliable biomarker copper relate ad subtype high specificity support use patient stratification potentially contribute personalize approach ad diagnosis therapy
40563425,Consideration of Anesthesia Techniques for Deep Brain Stimulation Implantation in the Treatment of Drug-Resistant Epilepsy: A Narrative Review.,"Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures, affecting millions worldwide. While anti-seizure medications serve as first-line treatment, approximately one-third of patients develop drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), necessitating alternative interventions. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a promising therapy for DRE, particularly for patients who are ineligible for resective surgery. DBS involves stereotactic implantation of electrodes into target brain regions, such as the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT), centromedian nucleus (CMT), and hippocampus (HC), to modulate aberrant neural activity and to reduce seizure frequency. Anesthesia plays a critical role in DBS implantation, influencing both patient safety and procedural success. The choice of anesthetic technique must balance patient comfort with the preservation of neurophysiological signals used for intraoperative electrode localization. A well-chosen anesthetic strategy can enhance the efficacy of electrode placement by minimizing patient movement and preserving critical neurophysiological signals for real-time monitoring. This precise targeting enhances safety via a reduction in perioperative risks and an improvement in long-term seizure control. Anesthetic considerations in epilepsy patients differ from those in movement disorders due to variations in their nuclei targets during DBS. Despite the increasing use of DBS for epilepsy following its FDA approval in 2018, research on anesthetic effects specific to this population remains limited. This narrative review, therefore, examines anesthetic approaches, pharmacological implications, potential complications, and evolving methods for DBS implantation in epilepsy patients, highlighting new insights and unique considerations in this population.

40563410,Targeting Glioblastoma Stem Cells: A40s Aptamer-NIR-Dye Conjugate for Glioblastoma Visualization and Treatment.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and challenging brain cancer, in terms of diagnosis and therapy. The highly infiltrative glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) are difficult to visualize and surgically remove with the current diagnostic tools, which often lead to misdiagnosis and false-positive results. In this study, we focused on a groundbreaking tool for specifically visualizing and removing GSCs. We exploited the specific binding of A40s aptamer to EphA2 for the selective delivery of Near-Infrared Dyes (NIR-Dyes), like IR700DX and ICG, both in vitro and in vivo. The A40s aptamer, engineered through the NIR-Dye conjugation, did not affect aptamer binding ability; indeed, A40s-NIR-Dye conjugates bound GLI261 stem-like cells and patient-derived GSCs in vitro; moreover, they induced cell death upon photodynamic therapy treatment (PDT). Additionally, when systemically administrated, the A40s-NIR-Dye conjugates allowed GSC visualization and accumulated in tumor mass. This allows GSCs detection and treatment. Our findings demonstrate the potential use of A40s aptamer as a targeted therapeutic approach and imaging tool in vivo for GSCs, paving the way for improved, more effective, and less invasive GBM management.",Biomolecules,2025.0,Alessandra Affinito; Francesco Ingenito; Sara Verde; Emanuele Musella; Birlipta Pattanayak; Danilo Fiore; Cristina Quintavalle; Aurelia Fraticelli; Martina Mascolo; Gianluca Petrillo; Claudia Pignataro; Giada De Luca; Laura Mezzanotte; Gerolama Condorelli,glioblastoma gbm aggressive challenging brain cancer term diagnosis therapy highly infiltrative glioblastoma stem cell gscs difficult visualize surgically remove current diagnostic tool lead misdiagnosis false positive result study focus groundbreaking tool specifically visualize remove gsc exploit specific binding a40s aptamer epha2 selective delivery near infrared dyes nir dyes like ir700dx icg vitro vivo a40s aptamer engineer nir dye conjugation affect aptamer bind ability a40s nir dye conjugate bind gli261 stem like cell patient derive gsc vitro induce cell death photodynamic therapy treatment pdt additionally systemically administrate a40s nir dye conjugate allow gsc visualization accumulate tumor mass allow gsc detection treatment finding demonstrate potential use a40s aptamer targeted therapeutic approach imaging tool vivo gsc pave way improve effective invasive gbm management
40563398,"Oxidative DNA Damage and Repair Dynamics in Multiple Sclerosis: Insights from Comet Assay Kinetics, Base Excision Repair Gene Expression, and Genotype Analysis.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory disease where oxidative stress and DNA damage may influence disease progression. We investigated whether defects in base excision repair (BER) pathways contribute to MS by combining functional DNA repair assays, gene expression profiling, and genotype analysis. We collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 70 MS patients and 61 healthy controls. These cells were subjected to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBH)-induced oxidative stress, and comet assay kinetics were measured over a period of 60 min. Additionally, we quantified the mRNA expression of nine key BER genes and genotyped selected polymorphisms related to DNA repair capacity. Samples from MS patients exhibited significantly higher levels of TBH-induced DNA lesions and displayed a distinct repair trajectory over time, as indicated by area-under-the-curve (AUC) analyses (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The transcripts of <i>MBD4</i> and <i>NTHL1</i> were notably reduced in MS patients compared to those in the controls (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). A logistic regression analysis revealed an association between the specific BER-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs3087404, rs4135054, and rs1052133 and ineffective DNA repair. Subset analyses of B cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells further supported the presence of altered repair kinetics in MS, even though some subsets exhibited similar baseline lesion levels. Our findings suggest that impaired oxidative DNA repair is present in MS, likely driven by functional deficits in repair kinetics and alterations in the expression of BER genes and polymorphisms.

PM<sub>2.5</sub> comprises a complex mixture of thousands of chemical constituents. To elucidate its neurotoxicity mechanisms, it is essential to investigate both its transport pathways to the brain and the specific actions of its individual components. This review highlights key PM<sub>2.5</sub> components-water-soluble ions, metals, carbonaceous particles, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, quinones, plastics, and bioaerosols-and outlines their potential routes of entry into the central nervous system, along with their associated mechanisms of action.

40563355,"Scutellarin Alleviates Cuprizone-Induced Demyelination by Improving Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Reducing Lipid Oxidation and Inhibiting the p38 MAPK Pathway.","The occurrence of demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) causes neurodegenerative lesions. The occurrence and development of demyelination involve multiple pathological mechanisms, including the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by mitochondrial dysfunction in microglia and subsequent neuroinflammation. Scutellarin is a natural flavonoid drug with significant neuroprotective effects, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties, and is widely used in the treatment of neurological diseases. However, the protective effects and mechanisms of scutellarin on demyelination have not yet been elucidated. This study aims to investigate the neuroprotective effects of scutellarin on demyelination and its underlying molecular mechanisms. Our results showed that treatment with scutellarin significantly alleviated Cuprizone-induced myelin damage, neuronal apoptosis, and neurological deficits in mice. In in vitro experiments, scutellarin significantly reduced Cuprizone-copper-induced pro-inflammatory microglia formation and inhibited the secretion of TNF-α, thereby reducing myelin cell damage. Mechanism studies revealed that scutellarin inhibited the secretion of TNF-α by microglia and alleviated myelin cell damage by reducing the excessive production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (Mito-ROS), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and malondialdehyde (MDA) induced by Cuprizone-copper in microglia. Finally, scutellarin improved mitochondrial dysfunction in microglia and significantly alleviated myelin cell damage by inhibiting the expression of p38MAPK. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that scutellarin exerts significant neuroprotective effects on Cuprizone-induced mice by improving mitochondrial dysfunction in microglia, thereby reducing inflammatory responses. This effect is closely associated with the inhibition of the p38MAPK pathway.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2025.0,Qiting Zhao; Yantuanjin Ma; Shufen Wang,occurrence demyelination central nervous system cns cause neurodegenerative lesion occurrence development demyelination involve multiple pathological mechanism include generation reactive oxygen species ros cause mitochondrial dysfunction microglia subsequent neuroinflammation scutellarin natural flavonoid drug significant neuroprotective effect include antioxidant anti inflammatory anti apoptotic property widely treatment neurological disease protective effect mechanism scutellarin demyelination elucidate study aim investigate neuroprotective effect scutellarin demyelination underlying molecular mechanism result show treatment scutellarin significantly alleviate cuprizone induce myelin damage neuronal apoptosis neurological deficit mouse vitro experiment scutellarin significantly reduce cuprizone copper induce pro inflammatory microglia formation inhibit secretion tnf α reduce myelin cell damage mechanism study reveal scutellarin inhibit secretion tnf α microglia alleviated myelin cell damage reduce excessive production mitochondrial reactive oxygen specie mito ros reactive oxygen species ros malondialdehyde mda induce cuprizone copper microglia finally scutellarin improve mitochondrial dysfunction microglia significantly alleviate myelin cell damage inhibit expression p38mapk conclusion finding demonstrate scutellarin exert significant neuroprotective effect cuprizone induce mouse improve mitochondrial dysfunction microglia reduce inflammatory response effect closely associate inhibition p38mapk pathway

40563328,Oxidative Stress: Pathological Driver in Chronic Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Oxidative stress has become a common impetus of various diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases. This review introduces the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROSs) in the nervous system, the cellular oxidative damage, and the high sensitivity of the brain to ROSs. The literature review focuses on the roles of oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Oxidative stress occurs when excessively produced free radicals are beyond the capability of endogenous antioxidants to scavenge, leading to the oxidation of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, stimulating neuroinflammatory responses, causing neuronal dysfunction, senescence, and death. The dysfunctional mitochondria and aberrant activities of metabolic enzymes are the major source of ROSs. The high vulnerability of the nervous system to ROSs underlies the critical roles of oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases. Gene mutations and other risk factors promote the generation of ROSs, which have been considered a crucial force causing the main pathological features of AD, PD, HD, and ALS. As a result, antioxidants hold therapeutic potential in these neurodegenerative diseases. The elucidation of the pathogenic mechanisms of oxidative stress will facilitate the development of antioxidants for the treatment of these diseases.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2025.0,Zhao Zhong Chong; Nizar Souayah,oxidative stress common impetus disease include neurodegenerative disease review introduce generation reactive oxygen species ross nervous system cellular oxidative damage high sensitivity brain ross literature review focus role oxidative stress neurodegenerative disease include alzheimer disease ad parkinson disease pd huntington disease hd amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als oxidative stress occur excessively produce free radical capability endogenous antioxidant scavenge lead oxidation protein lipid nucleic acid stimulate neuroinflammatory response cause neuronal dysfunction senescence death dysfunctional mitochondria aberrant activity metabolic enzyme major source ross high vulnerability nervous system ross underlie critical role oxidative stress neurodegenerative disease gene mutation risk factor promote generation ross consider crucial force cause main pathological feature ad pd hd als result antioxidant hold therapeutic potential neurodegenerative disease elucidation pathogenic mechanism oxidative stress facilitate development antioxidant treatment disease
40563324,Dynamic Transcriptomic and Cellular Remodeling Underlie Cuprizone-Induced Demyelination and Endogenous Repair in the CNS.,"Demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) disrupts neuronal communication and promotes neurodegeneration. Despite the widespread use of cuprizone-induced demyelination models to study myelin injury and repair, the mechanisms underlying oligodendrocyte apoptosis and regeneration are poorly understood. This study investigated the dynamic cellular and molecular changes that occur during demyelination and remyelination, with a focus on glial cell responses, blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and neuroimmune interactions. <i>C57BL/6J</i> mice exposed to cuprizone exhibited weight loss, sensorimotor deficits, and cognitive decline, which were reversed during remyelination. Histological and immunofluorescence analyses revealed reduced myelin protein levels, including myelin basic protein (MBP) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), and decreased oligodendrocyte populations during demyelination, with recovery during repair. The BBB permeability increases during demyelination, is associated with the decreased expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Occludin), and normalizes during remyelination. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed dynamic shifts in glial cell populations and upregulated Psap-Gpr37l1 signaling. Neuroimmune activation and oxidative stress peak during demyelination, characterized by elevated ROS, MDA, and immune cell infiltration, followed by recovery. Transcriptomic profiling revealed key inflammatory pathways (JAK-STAT, NF-κB) and hub genes associated with demyelination and repair.

40563239,"Big Data, Small Bias: Harmonizing Diffusion MRI-Based Structural Connectomes to Mitigate Site-Related Bias in Data Integration.","Diffusion MRI-based structural connectomes are increasingly used to investigate brain connectivity changes associated with various disorders. However, small sample sizes in individual studies, along with highly heterogeneous disorder-related manifestations, underscore the need to pool datasets across multiple studies to be able to identify coherent and generalizable connectivity patterns linked to these disorders. Yet, combining datasets introduces site-related differences due to variations in scanner hardware or acquisition protocols. These differences highlight the necessity for statistical data harmonization to mitigate site-related effects on structural connectomes while preserving the biological information associated with participant demographics and the disorders. While several paradigms exist for harmonizing normally distributed neuroimaging measures, this paper represents the first effort to establish a harmonization framework specifically tailored for the structural connectome. We conduct a thorough investigation of various statistical harmonization methods, adapting them to accommodate the unique distributional characteristics and graph-based properties of structural connectomes. Through rigorous evaluation, we show that our MATCH algorithm, based on the gamma-distributed model, consistently outperforms existing approaches in modeling structural connectomes, enabling the effective removal of site-related biases in both edge-based and downstream graph analyses while preserving biological variability. Two real-world applications further highlight the utility of our harmonization framework in addressing challenges in multi-site structural connectome analysis. Specifically, harmonization with MATCH enhances the generalizability of connectome-based machine learning predictors to new datasets and increases statistical power for detecting group-level differences.

Self-reported scales were used to assess PLEs and depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation was assessed. PLEs at baseline were significantly associated with increased odds of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation at both follow-up intervals after adjusting for covariates (all p < 0.001). Moreover, baseline depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation were significantly associated with increased likelihoods of subsequent PLEs (all p < 0.001).

40563192,Providing Culturally Centered Palliative Care to Latino Older Adults with Dementia and Their Families.,"Palliative care is essential for patients with serious illness, including those with dementia. Latino older adults are 1.5 times more likely to develop dementia than non-Latino White older adults and often do not receive palliative care, which has been shown to improve quality of life. In addition, there is great diversity among the Latino population, which comprises individuals from 20 countries, with different lived experiences and cultural expressions. Culture-centered palliative care (CCPC) is an approach to better serve the needs of this diverse community.

40563187,Improving Hospital Delirium Screening and Documentation.,"Appropriate delirium screening and documentation are important for hospitalized patients to ensure positive patient outcomes and patient safety. A preliminary process review at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, identified low adherence (25.9%) to delirium screening and documentation requirements. The aim of this quality improvement (QI) project was to identify gaps in delirium screening and documentation, determine possible causes of these gaps, and design interventions to help improve the completion of required delirium screening and documentation over one year without adversely affecting other required nursing assessments. The target of the project was an improvement in the rate of screening documentation of at least 50%. After Mayo Clinic's preliminary process review identified low adherence to delirium screening and documentation requirements, a multidisciplinary workgroup was convened, and a QI project following Six Sigma methods was implemented between May 2022 and April 2023 (the study period). Review of electronic health records (EHRs) and an informal survey of nurses and personal care assistants (enhanced by interviews and shadowing) facilitated fishbone analysis and creation of an impact-effort grid showing the relative difficulty and impact of possible interventions. An automated data-monitoring dashboard for the EHR was developed, and the Brief Confusion Assessment Method (bCAM) documentation in the EHR was restructured and introduced (first intervention). Nurse educational modules were amended to be consistent across practice areas, and a best-practice advisory (BPA) was created to bridge communication between nurses (RNs) and clinicians (physicians, NPs, and physician assistants). Delirium screening was added to the reminder list of required shift documentation in February 2023 (second intervention). A counterbalance measure, pressure injury risk, was chosen as a proxy for other required nursing assessments to show any unintentional downturn in other staff performance. After the bCAM redesign was introduced on June 1, 2022, delirium screening documentation decreased to 17.4% by June 30, but increased to 19.4% by July 31. After the RN educational module was implemented on July 1, delirium screening documentation increased further, to 20.7% by August, but dipped again to 13.7% by January 2023. After delirium screening was included in the required shift documentation reminder list in February 2023, delirium screening documentation significantly increased, from the baseline rate of 25.9% in May 2022 to 42.8% in March 2023 (P < 0.001) and to 47.7% in April 2023 (P < 0.001). The BPA was also associated with an increase in clinician capture of delirium diagnoses in the EHR of 47%. The rates of pressure injury risk assessment remained the same throughout the study period with only minor fluctuations. In this QI project, the addition of delirium screening to shift documentation was associated with a greater than 50% increase in screening documentation, suggesting improved nurse-clinician communication. Introduction of the BPA was also associated with increased clinician capture of delirium diagnoses in the EHR.

40563139,The Efficacy and Safety of Brain Radiotherapy Combined With Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) for Small-Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) Patients With Brain Metastases (BMs).,"This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of brain radiotherapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) retrospectively in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients with brain metastases (BMs). A retrospective analysis was conducted on 42 SCLC patients with BMs, who received brain radiotherapy combined with ICIs at our Hospital from 2020 to 2024. They received chemotherapy plus ICIs regimens and brain radiotherapy, and received concurrent/sequential thoracic radiotherapy. This study investigated the forms of WBRT vs. WBRT+ simultaneous integrated boost (SIB, different doses of radiation being delivered simultaneously to different parts of the tumor) combined with ICIs on overall survival (OS), intracranial local control (iLC), and radiotherapy adverse reactions (side effection). The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival rate analysis. The log-rank test was used to compare the survival curves between different groups, and the chi-square (χ<sup>2</sup>) test was used to compare categorical data. In all the patients, the median follow-up time was 19.2 (range: 9.79-36.8) months. The 2-year OS rate and iLC rate were 42.3% and 68.8%, respectively. A total of 26 patients died of disease progression; 2 patients developed radiation-induced brain necrosis. The results showed that there was no significant difference in radiation-induced brain necrosis between the two groups. The WBRT patients suffered high rates of headache, dizziness, nausea, and radiodermatitis. The 2-year OS and iLC were brilliant. When brain radiotherapy combined with ICIs, even WBRT or WBRT + SIB had well OS and iLC with tolerable side reactions. Its indications needed to be considered from multiple perspectives.

However, the pathogenesis of this kind of anxiety remains unclear. In this study, we investigated anxiety-like behaviors in young adult presenilin 1/2 conditional double knockout (PS cDKO) mice, a model of progressive cognitive impairment, using behavioral tests and electrophysiological recordings. Disrupted excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance was observed in pyramidal neurons (PNs) of the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) CA1 (vCA1) region of PS cDKO mice. Meanwhile, PV + interneurons showed hypoexcitability, associated with increased outward K<sup>+</sup> currents due to elevated Kv1.1 potassium channel levels. Importantly, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Kv1.1 restored PV + interneuron activity and reduced anxiety-like behaviors. These findings highlight a role of Kv1.1 in controlling PV + interneuron excitability, suggesting that targeting Kv1.1 in vCA1 PV + interneurons could mitigate anxiety in early-stage cognitive dysfunction.",Cell & bioscience,2025.0,Guang Yang; Yang Zhao; Chenyi Zhao; Jinglan Yan; Yucen Xia; Kun Li; Yongkang Wu; Xingyu Wang; Meng Zhang; Yongjun Chen; Ying Xu,anxiety occur early stage cognitive disorder exacerbate cognitive impairment pathogenesis kind anxiety remain unclear study investigate anxiety like behavior young adult presenilin 1/2 conditional double knockout ps cdko mouse model progressive cognitive impairment behavioral test electrophysiological recording disrupt excitatory inhibitory e balance observe pyramidal neuron pns ventral hippocampus vhpc ca1 vca1 region ps cdko mouse pv + interneuron show hypoexcitability associate increase outward k < sup>+</sup > current elevated kv1.1 potassium channel level importantly genetic pharmacological inhibition kv1.1 restore pv + interneuron activity reduced anxiety like behavior finding highlight role kv1.1 control pv + interneuron excitability suggest target kv1.1 vca1 pv + interneuron mitigate anxiety early stage cognitive dysfunction
40563113,Melatonin as a potential adjuvant to mitigate depakine‑induced testicular damage in rats through its biological features.,"Depakine (valproic acid) is an antiepileptic medication that is commonly used as a first-line treatment for a variety of seizures in both adults and children. However, it can result in testicular toxicity by increasing oxidative stress inflammation. Melatonin (MLT) has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic potential. Therefore, the present study investigated the impact of MLT on depakine-induced testicular damage in rats. Four groups of male Wistar rats were formed, each of 5 animals: Group 1 was the control group; Group 2 was the MLT-treated group, receiving 20 mg MLT/kg BW; Group 3 was the depakine group, receiving 45 mg/kg; and Group 4 was the MLT + depakine treatment group, which received MLT and depakine for 14 days. Drug treatments were by gavage and daily. Coadministration of MLT and depakine significantly (P < 0.001) improved the levels of testosterone and the expression of androgen receptors in the testes, explaining the improvement of sperm count, motility, and abnormalities. Similarly, spermatogenic cell depletion and shrinkage of seminiferous tubules were prevented by MLT + depakine treatment. Moreover, the testicles of rats given MLT + depakine had common histological architecture of seminiferous tubules, perimeter, and diameter, indicating melatonin's anti-reproductive disruption. The combined treatment with MLT and dapakine resulted in the normalization of hematological parameters, including erythrocyte, platelet, and leukocyte counts; hematocrit content; mean cellular volume; mean cellular hemoglobin; and mean cellular hemoglobin concentration to levels comparable to the control group. These effects were associated with the enhancement of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 and glutathione levels. Moreover, reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde formation were decreased in the testis compared to the depakine-treated rats, indicating improvement in the redox status in the testis. The improvement of redox balance caused a remarkable regression of apoptotic regulating proteins (Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3) in the testis and downregulated inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-6, ICAM-1, and MCP-1), indicating protection of spermatogenic cell viability. The combination treatment with MLT and depakine sustained male reproductive status, which can be attributable to the integrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties of MLT. These results may contribute to increase the clinical utility of depakine as a successful choice for neurological disorders.",BMC complementary medicine and therapies,2025.0,Maggie E Amer; Mohamed A Dardoor; Azza I Othman; Mohamed A El-Missiry,depakine valproic acid antiepileptic medication commonly line treatment variety seizure adult child result testicular toxicity increase oxidative stress inflammation melatonin mlt antioxidant anti inflammatory anti apoptotic potential present study investigate impact mlt depakine induce testicular damage rat group male wistar rat form 5 animal group 1 control group group 2 mlt treat group receive 20 mg mlt kg bw group 3 depakine group receive 45 mg kg group 4 mlt + depakine treatment group receive mlt depakine 14 day drug treatment gavage daily coadministration mlt depakine significantly p < 0.001 improve level testosterone expression androgen receptor testis explain improvement sperm count motility abnormality similarly spermatogenic cell depletion shrinkage seminiferous tubule prevent mlt + depakine treatment testicle rat give mlt + depakine common histological architecture seminiferous tubule perimeter diameter indicate melatonin anti reproductive disruption combined treatment mlt dapakine result normalization hematological parameter include erythrocyte platelet leukocyte count hematocrit content mean cellular volume mean cellular hemoglobin mean cellular hemoglobin concentration level comparable control group effect associate enhancement nuclear factor erythroid 2 relate factor-2 glutathione level reactive oxygen species malondialdehyde formation decrease testis compare depakine treat rat indicate improvement redox status testis improvement redox balance cause remarkable regression apoptotic regulating protein bax bcl-2 caspase-3 testis downregulate inflammatory cytokine chemokine nf κb tnf α il-6 icam-1 mcp-1 indicate protection spermatogenic cell viability combination treatment mlt depakine sustained male reproductive status attributable integrated antioxidant anti inflammatory antiapoptotic property mlt result contribute increase clinical utility depakine successful choice neurological disorder
40563111,Copper supplementation mitigates Parkinson-like wild-type SOD1 pathology and nigrostriatal degeneration in a novel mouse model.,"Misfolded wild-type superoxide dismutase 1 (disSOD1) protein is implicated in the death of substantia nigra (SN) dopamine neurons in Parkinson disease. Regionally reduced copper availability, and subsequent reduced copper binding to SOD1, is a key factor driving the development of this pathology, suggesting brain copper supplementation may constitute an effective means of preventing its formation. We evaluated whether the blood-brain-barrier-permeable copper delivery drug, CuATSM, attenuated the misfolding and deposition of wild-type disSOD1 and associated neuron death in a novel mouse model that expresses this pathology. These factors were profiled using proteomic and elemental mass spectrometry, together with biochemical and histological workflows. We demonstrated copper supplementation corrects altered post-translational modifications on soluble SOD1 and improves the enzymatic activity of the protein in the brains of these animals. These changes were associated with a significant reduction in disSOD1 pathology and preservation of dopamine neurons in the SN, which were highly correlated with tissue copper levels.

40563109,Primary care physician characteristics associated with becoming opioid agonist treatment prescribers in British Columbia: a retrospective case-control study.,"Opioid agonist treatment (OAT) is the gold standard of care for patients living with opioid use disorder. Since 2016, efforts to expand OAT access have focused on primary care physicians. This study aimed to understand how OAT-prescribing-naïve primary care physicians who began prescribing OAT differed from their peers who did not. We used administrative health data to identify all patients eligible for OAT initiation between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2019. We matched primary care visits that resulted in an OAT dispensation with visits that did not. We conducted logistic regression with generalized estimating equations to identify physician demographics and practice characteristics associated with becoming an OAT prescriber. Of the 4253 primary care physicians who were OAT-prescribing-naïve before 2016, 2183 (51.3%) began prescribing OAT. Physicians who practiced in rural settings (aOR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.32, 2.40) or saw fewer than 16 patients a day (aOR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.21, 1.75) were more likely to become OAT prescribers. The likelihood of becoming an OAT prescriber declined with the proportion of visits delivered out of office (aOR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.26) and years since graduation (e.g., physicians who graduated between 2000-2009 were 20% less likely to initiate (aOR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.99) compared with peers who graduated since 2010). Physicians who saw fewer patients and worked across fewer settings were more likely to become OAT prescribers. However, physicians in rural settings are stepping in to address unmet demand despite resource and time constraints.

40563086,"IFP35, a novel DAMP, aggravates neuroinflammation following acute ischemic stroke via TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling.","Acute ischemic stroke is a disastrous disease characterized by damaging blood flow in the brain, leading to acute brain injury. Acute brain ischemia elicits severe inflammation, thus in turn, aggravates neural injury. Interferon-Induced Protein 35 (IFP35), is a 35 kDa protein, a novel type of DAMP that trigger inflammatory responses, exacerbating acute and chronic inflammatory disease. This study aimed to investigate the potential neuroinflammation role of IFP35 in acute ischemic stroke in a mouse model of MCAO. C57BL/6 male mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to establish an animal model of acute ischemic stroke. Leveraging serum from stroke patients, serum and brain tissue after MCAO mice, IFP35 was released. Immunofluorescence assay was used to investigated the cell sources of IFP35 expression after MCAO. The impact of IFP35 on neuroinflammation and neural injury was assessed by siRNA-mediated cerebral IFP35 knockdown. Behavioral tests, and brain tissues were harvested for histological analysis and biochemical assays. TUNEL assays were used to evaluate neuronal damage. TTC staining was performed to assess infarction volumes. Additionally, using western blotting and immunofluorescence assays, we further assessed the contribution of TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling in MCAO mice and BV2 cells. IFP35 was accumulated in peripheral blood of cerebral ischaemia patients, ischemia mice serum, as well as peri-infarct regions in focal cerebral ischemia mice. Although endothelial cells, microglia, and astrocytes are capable of expressing IFP35, cerebral neural cells seem to express and release more IFP35 compare to other cell types. Knockdown of IFP35 alleviated the production of neuroinflammatory cytokines, decreased neuronal death, and minimized infarct volumes, ultimately leading to improved neurological outcomes. Importantly, IFP35 triggered the activation of NF-κΒ and NLRP3 signaling, exacerbating neuroinflammation and brain injury by binding its receptor TLR4. This study revealed IFP35 as a novel DAMP released during cerebral ischemia that promotes neuroinflammation and injury, expanding the current understanding of inflammatory networks following stroke.",Journal of neuroinflammation,2025.0,Mengmeng Zhang; Bingnan Guo; Xiaowei Zhang; Dong Han; Lanxin Lv; Xiaoqing Yan; Chenglei Su; Dafei Chai; Ningjun Zhao; Xianliang Yan; Shuqun Hu,acute ischemic stroke disastrous disease characterize damage blood flow brain lead acute brain injury acute brain ischemia elicit severe inflammation turn aggravate neural injury interferon induced protein 35 ifp35 35 kda protein novel type damp trigger inflammatory response exacerbate acute chronic inflammatory disease study aim investigate potential neuroinflammation role ifp35 acute ischemic stroke mouse model mcao c57bl/6 male mouse subject middle cerebral artery occlusion mcao establish animal model acute ischemic stroke leverage serum stroke patient serum brain tissue mcao mouse ifp35 release immunofluorescence assay investigate cell source ifp35 expression mcao impact ifp35 neuroinflammation neural injury assess sirna mediated cerebral ifp35 knockdown behavioral test brain tissue harvest histological analysis biochemical assay tunel assay evaluate neuronal damage ttc staining perform assess infarction volume additionally western blotting immunofluorescence assay assess contribution tlr4 nf κb nlrp3 signal mcao mouse bv2 cell ifp35 accumulate peripheral blood cerebral ischaemia patient ischemia mice serum peri infarct region focal cerebral ischemia mouse endothelial cell microglia astrocyte capable express ifp35 cerebral neural cell express release ifp35 compare cell type knockdown ifp35 alleviate production neuroinflammatory cytokine decrease neuronal death minimized infarct volume ultimately lead improve neurological outcome importantly ifp35 trigger activation nf κβ nlrp3 signal exacerbate neuroinflammation brain injury bind receptor tlr4 study reveal ifp35 novel damp release cerebral ischemia promote neuroinflammation injury expand current understanding inflammatory network follow stroke

40563051,Beyond the Heart: Exploring Extracardiac Manifestations in Cardiac Amyloidosis for Early Diagnosis.,"This review examines extracardiac manifestations of cardiac amyloidosis and their potential role in early diagnosis and management. Multisystem involvement, including musculoskeletal, peripheral nervous system, and other extracardiac findings are highlighted to serve as red flags for earlier detection. Early screening for high-risk individuals over 50 with CTS or spinal stenosis could enable earlier intervention. Peripheral neuropathy and CTS often precede cardiac involvement by 5-10 years, while spinal stenosis can precede it by 5-15 years. Other indicators include biceps tendon rupture, trigger finger, and gastrointestinal issues. MRI shows promise in detecting amyloid-related changes, especially wrist MRI. More studies are needed. Recognizing extracardiac findings may enable earlier diagnosis and intervention before significant cardiac dysfunction.

This study leverages machine learning to integrate standard intensive care unit (ICU) indicators, identifying 7-day high-mortality risk patients with TSCI to optimize treatment. Using critically ill patients with TSCI data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 2.2 database, this study employs the Boruta and LASSO regression algorithms to identify key features, developing a 7-day mortality risk prediction model in critically ill patients with TSCI using ten machine learning algorithms including Adaptive Boosting, Categorical Boosting, Gradient Boosting Machine, k-Nearest Neighbors, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Logistic Regression, Neural Network, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine, and Extreme Gradient Boosting. Model Performance is evaluated via receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curves, decision curve analysis, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1 score, whereas Shapley Additive Explanations ensure model interpretability. External validation with ICU data from the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University further assesses the model's generalizability. This study, collecting data from 261 and 45 critically ill patients with TSCI from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University's ICU, respectively, identified ten key features for model development, in which the RF model consistently outperformed others across raw and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique-balanced synthetic datasets in receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curves, decision curve analysis, and performance metrics.

40563018,Possible Mitigating Effect of Nobiletin on Rotenone-Induced Parkinsonism in Male Albino Rat Model: Targeting Bmal1/Nrf2 Mediated Ferroptosis and Restoring Mitochondrial Mitophagy.,"Ferroptosis and circadian disruption might be implicated in Parkinson disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder due to degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. As such, the ability to preserve mitochondrial and therefore neuronal homeostasis is essential. In PD, Nobiletin (NOB) may have neuroprotective effects. Still, further clarification is needed about the processes behind these impacts. To evaluate the positive effect of NOB against rotenone induced PD in rats via the Bmal1/ NRF2 axis regulation. Four groups of thirty-two male Albino rats were randomly assigned: Control, NOB treated, rotenone treated, and combined Rotenone and NOB treated groups. The validation of the neuroprotective potential of NOB entailed a behavioral examination, RT-PCR and colorimetric evaluation of biochemical markers, as well as immunohistopathological study of brain tissues. The relative gene expression of Bmal1 increased with NOB therapy significantly reducing the circadian rhythm disruption. Furthermore, as shown by the elevated Nrf2-DNA binding activity, increased levels of GPx4, and decreased levels of GSH with comparable low levels of MDA and Fe<sup>+2</sup> in the brain tissue, NOB ameliorated oxidative stress and ferroptosis. NOB stimulated both mitophagy and autophagy through the activation of Bmal1/Nrf2 pathway as characterized by upregulated expression of PINK-1 & Parkin genes and enhanced beclin-1 and LC3-II immunoreaction. This study showed that NOB ameliorated rotenone-induced PD by modulating dysregulated behavioral & cognitive dysfunction, attenuating ferroptosis & redox imbalance, and promoting mitophagy & autophagy through modulation of disrupted circadian rhythm through Bmal1/Nrf2 pathway.",Neurochemical research,2025.0,Sarah Ragab Abd El-Khalik; Norhan Ahmed AbuoHashish; Elham Nasif; Heba M Arakeep; Noha El-Anwar; Doaa Mohammed Yousef; Nada Hashem Ayad,ferroptosis circadian disruption implicate parkinson disease pd neurodegenerative disorder degeneration dopaminergic neuron substantia nigra ability preserve mitochondrial neuronal homeostasis essential pd nobiletin nob neuroprotective effect clarification need process impact evaluate positive effect nob rotenone induce pd rat bmal1/ nrf2 axis regulation group thirty male albino rat randomly assign control nob treat rotenone treat combine rotenone nob treat group validation neuroprotective potential nob entail behavioral examination rt pcr colorimetric evaluation biochemical marker immunohistopathological study brain tissue relative gene expression bmal1 increase nob therapy significantly reduce circadian rhythm disruption furthermore show elevated nrf2 dna binding activity increase level gpx4 decrease level gsh comparable low level mda fe < sup>+2</sup > brain tissue nob ameliorate oxidative stress ferroptosis nob stimulate mitophagy autophagy activation bmal1 nrf2 pathway characterize upregulated expression pink-1 parkin gene enhance beclin-1 lc3 ii immunoreaction study show nob ameliorate rotenone induce pd modulate dysregulate behavioral cognitive dysfunction attenuate ferroptosis redox imbalance promote mitophagy autophagy modulation disrupted circadian rhythm bmal1 nrf2 pathway
40563011,Microglia promote inflammatory cell death upon neuronal mitochondrial impairment during neurodegeneration.,"The failure to clear dysfunctional mitochondria, cell death and inflammation have been linked in neurodegenerative disease, but their relationship and role in these conditions is not fully understood. Loss of Vps13d prevents clearance of mitochondria, and mutations in human VPS13D have been associated with neurological movement disorders. To investigate the relationship between mitochondrial health, inflammation and neurodegeneration, we created a conditional Vps13d-knockout mouse. Loss of Vps13d in excitatory neurons resulted in behavioral changes and neurodegeneration. Vacuolar protein sorting 13D (VPS13D) deficiency also caused mitochondrial ultrastructural defects and dysfunction in neurons followed by gasdermin E processing, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor (STING) signaling, microglial activation and cell death. Gasdermin E localization with mitochondria in Vps13d-mutant neurons was required for elevated extracellular mitochondrial DNA that promoted activation of microglia. Depletion of microglia suppressed cell death and behavioral phenotypes but not mitochondrial changes in the neuron-specific Vps13d-knockout model, indicating that microglia promote cell death in this model of neurodegenerative disease.",Nature structural & molecular biology,2025.0,Guangyan Miao; Tina M Fortier; Haibo Liu; Dorothy P Schafer; Katherine A Fitzgerald; Junhao Mao; Eric H Baehrecke,failure clear dysfunctional mitochondria cell death inflammation link neurodegenerative disease relationship role condition fully understand loss vps13d prevent clearance mitochondria mutation human vps13d associate neurological movement disorder investigate relationship mitochondrial health inflammation neurodegeneration create conditional vps13d knockout mouse loss vps13d excitatory neuron result behavioral change neurodegeneration vacuolar protein sort 13d vps13d deficiency cause mitochondrial ultrastructural defect dysfunction neuron follow gasdermin e processing cyclic gmp amp synthase cgas)-stimulator interferon response cgamp interactor sting signal microglial activation cell death gasdermin e localization mitochondria vps13d mutant neuron require elevated extracellular mitochondrial dna promote activation microglia depletion microglia suppress cell death behavioral phenotype mitochondrial change neuron specific vps13d knockout model indicate microglia promote cell death model neurodegenerative disease

Our Study aimed to evaluate the relationship between breastfeeding mothers' psychological distress and the Mediterranean diet and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet. The data were collected in a cross-sectional survey conducted by the authors in 2021. Psychological parameters were assessed in 350 breastfeeding mothers using the Quality of Life (QL) Questionnaire, Depression Scale, Anxiety Questionnaire, and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). A Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) assessed adherence to the MIND diet. Mothers in the highest tertile of the MIND diet had significantly lower maternal sleep disturbance scores (3.71 ± 3.61 vs. 5.28 ± 3.89; P < 0.001), lower anxiety scores (30.86 ± 7.49 vs. 32.89 ± 7.90; P-value = 0.01) and better maternal mental health (21.58 ± 3.68 vs. 20.76 ± 3.15) compared to those in the lowest tertile. After controlling for potential confounders, adherence to the MIND pattern was associated with less maternal sleep disturbance (β = 0.89; 95%CI: 0.82-0.96). for practice.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of behavioural problems of AS patients on the parental perception of quality of life. The German version of the Abberant Behaviour Checklist (ABC) was used to record the behavioural problems of the children and adolescents. The outcome variable parental impact was measured using the Familiy Impact module of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQl Familiy impact).

40562976,Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Nomlabofusp in Non-clinical Studies of Friedreich's Ataxia.,"Nomlabofusp is a cell penetrant peptide-based recombinant fusion protein designed to enter cells and deliver human frataxin into the mitochondria of adults and children with Friedreich's ataxia. In this article we present non-clinical studies evaluating the pharmacology of nomlabofusp, including in a murine striated muscle tissue frataxin knockout model of Friedreich's ataxia. We demonstrate that subcutaneous administration of nomlabofusp distributes in a dose-dependent manner to several organs including the dorsal root ganglion, heart, and skeletal muscle, which are known to be predominantly affected in Friedreich's ataxia, as well as to other tissues, including skin. Plasma nomlabofusp concentrations correlated with levels of human frataxin delivered by nomlabofusp into tissues, and the increases in frataxin were correlated amongst tissues, especially with skin. In the knockout mice, we show that the pharmacokinetics and processing of nomlabofusp were comparable with wild type animals and that treatment with nomlabofusp halts the progression of cardiac dysfunction and significantly increased survival. Together, the findings from these non-clinical studies demonstrate that nomlabofusp exposure increases human frataxin in Friedreich's ataxia-relevant tissues and provide evidence of pharmacologic effects.",The AAPS journal,2025.0,Flavia De Toni; Vanessa Ragaglia; Devin Schecter; Angela S Miller; Eric Gonzalez; Erik J Wagner; Xin Xu; R Mark Payne; Jean-Nicholas Mess; Matthew G Baile; Adrienne Clements-Egan; Gopi Shankar,nomlabofusp cell penetrant peptide base recombinant fusion protein design enter cell deliver human frataxin mitochondria adult child friedreich ataxia article present non clinical study evaluate pharmacology nomlabofusp include murine striate muscle tissue frataxin knockout model friedreich ataxia demonstrate subcutaneous administration nomlabofusp distribute dose dependent manner organ include dorsal root ganglion heart skeletal muscle know predominantly affect friedreich ataxia tissue include skin plasma nomlabofusp concentration correlate level human frataxin deliver nomlabofusp tissue increase frataxin correlate tissue especially skin knockout mouse pharmacokinetic processing nomlabofusp comparable wild type animal treatment nomlabofusp halt progression cardiac dysfunction significantly increase survival finding non clinical study demonstrate nomlabofusp exposure increase human frataxin friedreich ataxia relevant tissue provide evidence pharmacologic effect

So, The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of high intensity interval training (HIIT) and vitamin E (VE) on the PI3K/NRF2 pathway in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease rats (AD). In this expremantal study, fifty aged AD rats with 10 mg/kg trimethyltin (TMT), were divided into groups 1) TMT, 2) VE solvent (Sham), 3) VE (30 mg/kg), 4) HIIT (90-95% of the maximum running speed) and 5) HIIT+VE. Ten healthy rats were included in the healthy control group to investigate the effect of TMT on research variables. Results Showed that, HIIT, VE and HIIT+VE decreased amyloid beta (P≤0.05), HIIT and HIIT+VE decreased NF-kB (P≤0.05) as well as HIIT, VE and HIIT+VE increased SOD and decreased MDA. HIIT simultaneously with VE increased PI3K, NRF2, and Cat. HIIT, VE and the interaction of HIIT and VE decreased the expression of miR-125b and increased expression of miR-132 (P≤0.05); The combination of HIIT and VE increased capillary density in areas 1 and 3, the percentage of healthy cells in C1 and C3 areas of the hippocampus (P≤0.05). The effects of HIIT and HIIT+VE on improving memory were better than VE (P≤0.05). It seems that HIIT and VE can synergistically increase the expression of antioxidant genes from the PI3K/NRF2 pathway by decreasing miR-125 and increasing miR-132.

40562934,Engrafted nitrergic neurons derived from hPSCs improve gut dysmotility in mice.,"Gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders represent a major medical challenge, with few effective therapies available. These disorders often result from dysfunction of inhibitory nitric oxide (NO)-producing motor neurons in the enteric nervous system, which are essential for regulating gut motility. Loss or dysfunction of NO neurons is linked to severe conditions, including achalasia, gastroparesis, intestinal pseudo-obstruction and chronic constipation<sup>1,2</sup>. Here we introduce a platform based on human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) for therapeutic development targeting GI motility disorders. Using an unbiased screen, we identified drug candidates that modulate NO neuron activity and enhance motility in mouse colonic tissue ex vivo. We established a high-throughput strategy to define developmental programs driving the specification of NO neurons and found that inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) promotes their differentiation from precursors of the enteric nervous system. Transplantation of these neurons into NO-neuron-deficient mice led to robust engraftment and improved GI motility, offering a promising cell-based therapy for neurodegenerative GI disorders.

40562930,Mechanism of cytarabine-induced neurotoxicity.,"Postmitotic neurons have high levels of methylated cytosine and its oxidized intermediates such as 5-hydroxymethylcytosine<sup>1</sup>. However, the functional relevance of these epigenetic modifications of DNA are poorly understood. Here we show that some cytidine analogues, such as cytarabine, cause DNA double-strand breaks during TET-mediated active 5-methylcytosine demethylation by interrupting TDG-dependent base excision repair. These double-strand breaks are frequently converted into deletions and translocations by DNA ligase 4. In vivo, Purkinje and Golgi cells in the cerebellum are the only neuronal populations that exhibit high levels of DNA damage due to cytarabine. In Purkinje cells, TET targets highly expressed gene bodies marked by enhancer-associated histone modifications. Many of these genes control movement coordination, which explains the long-recognized cerebellar neurotoxicity of cytarabine<sup>2</sup>. We show that other cytidine analogues, such as gemcitabine, cause only single-strand breaks in neurons, which are repaired by DNA ligase 3 with minimal toxicity. Our findings uncover a mechanistic link between TET-mediated DNA demethylation, base excision repair and gene expression in neurons.

We mapped these SNPs to genes and investigated their likely functional consequences by integrating variant annotations, brain cell-type epigenomic annotations, brain quantitative trait loci and results from rare variant exome sequencing in bipolar disorder. Convergent lines of evidence supported the roles of genes involved in neurotransmission and neurodevelopment, including SCN2A, TRANK1, DCLK3, INSYN2B, SYNE1, THSD7A, CACNA1B, TUBBP5, FKBP2, RASGRP1, FURIN, FES, MED24 and THRA among others in bipolar disorder.

40562860,Chronic liver injury scores are superior prognostic indicators of outcomes in severe alcohol-related burns.,"Acute and chronic alcohol abuse are common among burn patients and may be associated with chronic liver injury, a potential factor influencing outcomes. This study evaluates the predictive power of the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and non-invasive liver fibrosis scores and their applicability in burn patients. A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients admitted to a high-volume supraregional burn center in Northern Germany between 2007 and 2024. Patients were categorized based on their BAC at admission: low (< 100 mg/dL) vs. high (≥ 100 mg/dL). Data collected included demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes. Non-invasive liver fibrosis markers such as the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score, aspartate transaminase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) fibrosis score were applied to both groups. Among 121 large-surface burn patients (mean total body surface area: 16.4%), no significant differences were observed between BAC groups in demographics, comorbidities, or ICU admission rates. The serum ethanol concentration showed no significant predictive value for mortality (AUC = 0.515). In contrast, the FIB-4 score (AUC = 0.781) and APRI (AUC = 0.736) demonstrated strong prognostic accuracy. In multivariate analysis, the Abbreviated Burn Severity Index (OR = 2.42; p = 0.001), serum albumin (OR = 0.29; p = 0.016), and FIB-4 score (OR = 1.50; p = 0.033) emerged as independent predictors of mortality. Propensity score matching analysis confirmed that BAC was not associated with increased mortality after adjustment for burn depth and extent. Non-invasive liver fibrosis markers, such as FIB-4 score, provide valuable prognostic insights in burn patients, independent of acute alcohol intoxication and should be considered a routine screening tool for large surface burn patients.

40562846,SEL1L-HRD1-mediated ERAD in mammals.,"Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) is a critical quality control mechanism responsible for eliminating misfolded or unassembled proteins. It maintains endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis, ensures a proper folding environment and regulates substrate protein levels. Following its discovery in the late 1980s and early 1990s, research on ERAD in mammals-particularly that mediated by the conserved protein complex comprising suppressor/enhancer of Lin-12-like protein 1-like (SEL1L) and HMG-CoA reductase degradation protein 1 (HRD1)-has advanced substantially over the past decade. SEL1L-HRD1-mediated ERAD is now recognized as a fundamental process in mammals that governs various physiological functions largely in a substrate-specific manner. In humans, mutations in this complex have been causally linked to ERAD-associated neurodevelopmental disorders with onset in infancy (ENDI) and ENDI-agammaglobulinaemia.

40562808,Comprehensive analysis of CNOT3-related neurodevelopmental disorders: phenotypic and genotypic characterization.,"The CCR4-NOT complex, crucial in gene expression regulation, includes CNOT3, a subunit linked to neurodevelopmental disorders when mutated. This study investigates 51 patients from 42 families with heterozygous CNOT3 variants, aiming to expand the understanding of CNOT3-related neurodevelopmental disorders and explore genotype-phenotype correlations. Patients originated from various countries, reflecting the disorder's global significance. All patients exhibited developmental delays, particularly in the language area. Intellectual disability was found in 87% of patients and was typically mild to moderate. Behavioral issues, including autism spectrum disorders and attention deficits, were common, affecting over half of the patients. Dysmorphic features were highlighted and may help establishing the diagnosis. Epilepsy was uncommon (10%). Twenty-eight novel variants were identified, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, intronic variations and a deletion of 12 exons. Missense variants clustered at the N- and C-terminal regions of the protein, indicating critical functional roles. No clear genotype-phenotype correlation was observed, suggesting that all identified variants resulted in a loss-of-function effect. Finally, this work delineates the clinical and molecular spectrum of CNOT3-related disorders thanks to an in-depth characterization of a large cohort. Further research will be necessary to understand the functional consequences of the variants and enhance patient long-term outcomes.",European journal of human genetics : EJHG,2025.0,Camille Engel; Michaela Rendek; Jessica Assoumani; Emanuela Argilli; Francesca Ariani; Anne-Laude Avice-Denizet; Emilia K Bijlsmaa; Pierre Blanc; Lucia Pia Bruno; Bert Callewaert; Valeria Capra; Michele Carullo; Bertrand Chesneau; Sandra Coppens; Cynthia Curry; Breanne Dale; Eric Dahlen; Andrée Delahaye-Duriez; Anne-Sophie Denommé-Pichon; Bénédicte Demeer; Lenka Dvořáková; Jan Fischer; David Geneviève; Thea Giacomini; Mette M Handrup; Delphine Heron; Irina Hüning; Michelle Iacomino; Bertrand Isidor; Boris Keren; Stanislav Kmoch; David A Koolen; Andrea Kübler; Jana Laštůvková; Carolyn Le; Jonathan Levy; Caterina Lo Rizzo; Silvia Maitz; Sandrine Marlin; Cyril Mignot; Ghayda Mirzaa; Inga Nagel; Sebastian Neuens; Lenka Nosková; Emily Pao; Anna Pecková; Julie Plaisancie; Joseph Porrmann; Flavia Privitera; André Reis; Alessandra Renieri; Marlène Rio; Alyssa Rippert; Lukáš Ryba; Marcello Scala; Jolanda H Schieving; Elliott H Sherr; Andrew Shuen; Richard Sidlow; Thomas Smol; Julie Soblet; Pasquale Striano; Mohnish Suri; Hannes Syryn; Frédéric Tran Mau-Them; Andre M Travessa; Julien Van Gils; Georgia Vasileiou; Jolijn J A Verseput; Catheline Vilain; Catherine Vincent-Delorme; Emílie Vyhnálková; Emma L Wakeling; Pia Zacher; Federico Zara; Paul Kuentz; Juliette Piard,ccr4 complex crucial gene expression regulation include cnot3 subunit link neurodevelopmental disorder mutate study investigate 51 patient 42 family heterozygous cnot3 variant aim expand understanding cnot3 relate neurodevelopmental disorder explore genotype phenotype correlation patient originate country reflect disorder global significance patient exhibit developmental delay particularly language area intellectual disability find 87 patient typically mild moderate behavioral issue include autism spectrum disorder attention deficit common affect half patient dysmorphic feature highlight help establish diagnosis epilepsy uncommon 10 novel variant identify include missense nonsense frameshift intronic variation deletion 12 exon missense variant cluster n- c terminal region protein indicate critical functional role clear genotype phenotype correlation observe suggest identify variant result loss function effect finally work delineate clinical molecular spectrum cnot3 relate disorder thank depth characterization large cohort research necessary understand functional consequence variant enhance patient long term outcome
40562807,Identification of novel therapeutic targets for cognitive performance and associations with brain health.,"Cognitive dysfunction poses a significant challenge in clinical practice, but currently available drugs mainly address symptoms and have limited effectiveness in treating cognitive dysfunction associated with various neurological disorders. Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization analyses were conducted to explore the causal associations between 4302 druggable genes with blood and brain cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and cognitive performance. The causal effects of candidate druggable genes on brain structure and neurological diseases were assessed to gain insights into the underlying mechanisms. Among over 4000 druggable genes, our study identified causal associations between 72 druggable genes (41 blood eQTLs and 31 brain eQTLs) and cognitive performance. Thirteen eQTLs (six in blood: ERBB3, SPEG, ATP2A1, GDF11, CYP2D6, GANAB; seven in brain: ERBB3, DPYD, TAB1, WNT4, CLCN2, PPM1B, CAMKV) were identified as candidate druggable genes for cognitive performance. Notably, both blood and brain eQTLs of ERBB3 were negatively associated with cognitive performance (blood: OR = 0.933, 95% CI 0.911-0.956, p-value = 9.69E-09; brain: OR = 0.782, 95% CI 0.718-0.852, p-value = 2.13E-08). Moreover, these candidate druggable genes exhibited causal effects on both brain structure and neurological diseases. Our integrative analysis provides genetic evidence supporting candidate therapeutic targets for improving cognitive performance and treating neurological diseases. Furthermore, it sheds light on the possible mechanisms by which these targets affect brain structures. This finding suggested that these identified druggable genes, particularly ERBB3 and CYP2D6, hold promise as potential drug targets for enhancing cognitive performance.",Translational psychiatry,2025.0,Lu-Yang Zhang; Yu-Xin Liu; Yun-Hui Chu; Yun-Fan You; Luo-Qi Zhou; Sheng Yang; Ming-Hao Dong; Hang Zhang; Xiao-Wei Pang; Lian Chen; Li-Fang Zhu; Jun Xiao; Ke Shang; Wei Wang; Chuan Qin; Dai-Shi Tian,cognitive dysfunction pose significant challenge clinical practice currently available drug mainly address symptom limit effectiveness treat cognitive dysfunction associate neurological disorder mendelian randomization mr colocalization analysis conduct explore causal association 4302 druggable gene blood brain cis expression quantitative trait loci eqtls cognitive performance causal effect candidate druggable gene brain structure neurological disease assess gain insight underlie mechanism 4000 druggable gene study identify causal association 72 druggable gene 41 blood eqtls 31 brain eqtls cognitive performance thirteen eqtls blood erbb3 speg atp2a1 gdf11 cyp2d6 ganab seven brain erbb3 dpyd tab1 wnt4 clcn2 ppm1b camkv identify candidate druggable gene cognitive performance notably blood brain eqtls erbb3 negatively associate cognitive performance blood = 0.933 95 ci 0.911 0.956 p value = 9.69e-09 brain = 0.782 95 ci 0.718 0.852 p value = 2.13e-08 candidate druggable gene exhibit causal effect brain structure neurological disease integrative analysis provide genetic evidence support candidate therapeutic target improve cognitive performance treat neurological disease furthermore shed light possible mechanism target affect brain structure finding suggest identify druggable gene particularly erbb3 cyp2d6 hold promise potential drug target enhance cognitive performance
40562790,Prion-induced ferroptosis is facilitated by RAC3.,"Prions are infectious agents that initiate transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, causing devastating neuronal destruction in Creutzfeldt-Jakob and Kuru disease. Rapid cell death depends on presence of the endogenous prion protein PrP<sup>C</sup>, but its mechanistic contribution to pathogenesis is unclear. Here we investigate the molecular role of PrP<sup>C</sup>, reactive oxygen species and lipid metabolism in ferroptosis susceptibility, a regulated cell death process characterized by lipid peroxidation. We discover that elevated expression of the cellular prion PrP<sup>C</sup> creates a relaxed oxidative milieu that favors accumulation of unsaturated long-chain phospholipids responsible for ferroptotic death. This condition is sustained by the luminal protein glutathione peroxidase 8, which detoxifies reactive species produced by protein misfolding. Consequently, both PrP<sup>C</sup> and infectious Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) prions trigger ferroptotic markers and sensitization. This lethality is further enhanced by RAC3, a small GTPase. Depletion of RAC3 is observed solely in pathologically afflicted cortices in CJD patients, revealing a synergistic modulation of lipids and reactive species that drives ferroptosis susceptibility. Together, the results show that PrP<sup>C</sup> initially suppresses oxidative stress, attenuates cellular defenses, and establishes a systemic vulnerability to the ferroptotic cascade. These results provide insight into the mechanism underlying regulation of ferroptosis in prion diseases and highlight potential therapeutic targets for diseases involving dysregulated cell death processes.",Nature communications,2025.0,Hao Peng; Susanne Pfeiffer; Borys Varynskyi; Marina Qiu; Chanikarn Srinark; Xiang Jin; Xin Zhang; Katie Williams; Bradley R Groveman; Simote T Foliaki; Brent Race; Tina Thomas; Chengxuan Chen; Constanze Müller; Krisztina Kovács; Thomas Arzberger; Stefan Momma; Cathryn L Haigh; Joel A Schick,prion infectious agent initiate transmissible spongiform encephalopathy cause devastating neuronal destruction creutzfeldt jakob kuru disease rapid cell death depend presence endogenous prion protein prp < sup > c</sup > mechanistic contribution pathogenesis unclear investigate molecular role prp < sup > c</sup > reactive oxygen specie lipid metabolism ferroptosis susceptibility regulated cell death process characterize lipid peroxidation discover elevated expression cellular prion prp < sup > c</sup > create relaxed oxidative milieu favor accumulation unsaturated long chain phospholipid responsible ferroptotic death condition sustain luminal protein glutathione peroxidase 8 detoxify reactive specie produce protein misfolding consequently prp < sup > c</sup > infectious creutzfeldt jakob disease cjd prion trigger ferroptotic marker sensitization lethality enhance rac3 small gtpase depletion rac3 observe solely pathologically afflict cortex cjd patient reveal synergistic modulation lipid reactive specie drive ferroptosis susceptibility result prp < sup > c</sup > initially suppress oxidative stress attenuate cellular defense establish systemic vulnerability ferroptotic cascade result provide insight mechanism underlie regulation ferroptosis prion disease highlight potential therapeutic target disease involve dysregulate cell death process
40562771,AAV-based delivery of RNAi targeting ataxin-2 improves survival and pathology in TDP-43 mice.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) involves motor neuron death due to mislocalized TDP-43. Pathologic TDP-43 associates with stress granules (SGs), and lowering the SG-associated protein ataxin-2 (ATXN2) using Atxn2-targeting antisense oligonucleotides prolongs survival in TAR4/4 sporadic ALS mice but failed in clinical trials likely due to poor target engagement. Here we show that an AAV with potent motor neuron transduction delivering Atxn2-targeting miRNAs reduces Atxn2 throughout the central nervous system at doses 40x lower than published work. In TAR4/4 mice, miAtxn2 increased survival (50%) and strength, and reduced motor neuron death, inflammation, and phosphorylated TDP-43. TAR4/4 transcriptomic dysregulation recapitulated ALS gene signatures that were rescued by miAtxn2, identifying potential therapeutic mechanisms and biomarkers. In slow progressing hemizygous mice, miAtxn2 slowed disease progression, and in ALS patient-derived lower motor neurons, our AAV vector transduced >95% of cells and potently reduced ATXN2 at MOI 4 logs lower than previously reported.

40562759,Elevated plasma GDF15 combined with FGF21 suggests mitochondrial dysfunction in a subgroup of anorexia nervosa patients.,"Growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is a significant player in cellular stress and energy homeostasis. GDF15 is elevated in cancer cachexia, chemotherapy-induced anorexia, hyperemesis gravidarum, and mitochondrial disorders. Here we analyze GDF15 in anorexia nervosa (AN), a psychiatric disorder characterized by low weight and persistent restriction of food intake. While no significant difference in plasma GDF15 concentration was seen across the three included groups; active AN, recovered AN, and healthy controls, a subgroup of study participants with high GDF15 plasma was noted to a significantly higher extent in the AN groups. Sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) identified six markers related to inflammatory processes or cellular stress from a set of 74 markers that distinguished AN with high GDF15 from the rest, with fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) being the most important contributor. Moreover, FGF21 plasma concentration was significantly higher in the group with high GDF15, suggesting an involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction. In fact, mitochondrial polygenic risk score (PRS) was significantly associated with AN risk in a large AN case-control cohort. In line with this, we also report elevated liver expression of GDF15 in the anx/anx mouse displaying anorexia associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. We conclude that mitochondrial dysfunction should be further explored in AN.

The aim was to determine whether upper cervical spine sensitivity tested by the UPT is associated with neck-related disability or increased pain sensitization in patients with migraine. Forty-two patients with episodic migraine were examined regarding mechanical and pressure pain thresholds, central sensitization (CSI), allodynia (ASC-12) and neck-related disability (NDI), and sub-grouped according to the UPT. An ANOVA analysis was performed for group differences. Exploratory regression and correlation analyses were performed with NDI and CSI as dependent variables to understand which factors are related and contribute to either subgroup allocation. No significant differences were found in UPT subgroups regarding CSI and NDI. The UPT subgroups could not be determined by any evaluated variable. The NDI was explained in 43.6% by the CSI and neck pain intensity. CSI results were explained to 49.4% by a model including ASC-12 and NDI.

40562749,ETMR stem-like state and chemo-resistance are supported by perivascular cells at single-cell resolution.,"Embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes (ETMR) is a lethal embryonal brain tumor entity. To investigate the intratumoral heterogeneity and cellular communication in the tumor microenvironment (TME), we analyze in this work single-cell RNA sequencing of about 250,000 cells of primary human and murine ETMR, in vitro cultures, and a 3D forebrain organoid model of ETMR, supporting the main findings with immunohistochemistry and spatial transcriptomics of human tumors. We characterize three distinct malignant ETMR subpopulations - RG-like, NProg-like and NB-like - positioned within a putative neurodevelopmental hierarchy. We reveal PDGFRβ<sup>+</sup> pericytes as key communication partners in the TME, contributing to stem cell signaling through extracellular matrix-mediated interactions with tumor cells. PDGF signaling is upregulated in chemoresistant RG-like cells in vivo and plays a role in recruiting pericytes to ETMR TME by finalizing a signaling cascade which promotes the differentiation of non-malignant radial glia cells, derived from our 3D model, into pericyte-like cells.

40562716,Capillaries susceptible to frequent stall dynamics revealed by comparing OCT and bessel-2PM measurements.,"Transient stoppages of red blood cell (RBC) flow through capillaries-termed capillary stalls-occur persistently in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and ischemic stroke and can interrupt oxygen delivery and exacerbate neurological damage. Effective imaging tools and analyses are necessary to understand the nature, role, and prevention of stalls. In this study, we dissect differences in stalls measured by two-photon Bessel beam microscopy (Bessel-2PM) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) to gain insight into the temporal dynamics of stalls. Twenty-minute series of volumetric angiograms were obtained separately with Bessel-2PM and OCT on the same day in awake, head-fixed mice. The temporal dynamics of stalling in both methods revealed a minority population of susceptible capillaries that exhibited frequent stalls and a large majority of capillaries with infrequent stalls. Differences between OCT and Bessel-2PM in the repeatability and dynamics of stalls are explained by differences in their sensitivity to short or infrequent stalls based on scanning speed and detection off-time. Finally, stroke caused a shift toward the frequently stalling capillary subpopulation, lasting 1 week post-stroke. Dynamic stall analysis therefore enables examination of physiological and methodological contributions to the stalls measured in disease models and across studies.",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,2025.0,Rockwell P Tang; Shannon Kelley; Gülce Küreli; Emily A Long; Piergiulio R Bressan; Shashwat Shah; Şefik E Erdener; John Jiang; John T Giblin; Sreekanth Kura; Matthew G Simkulet; Bradley C Rauscher; Chris B Schaffer; Nozomi Nishimura; Martin Thunemann; Anna Devor; David A Boas,transient stoppage red blood cell rbc flow capillary term capillary stall occur persistently neurological disorder alzheimer disease ischemic stroke interrupt oxygen delivery exacerbate neurological damage effective imaging tool analysis necessary understand nature role prevention stall study dissect difference stall measure photon bessel beam microscopy bessel-2pm optical coherence tomography oct gain insight temporal dynamic stall minute series volumetric angiogram obtain separately bessel-2pm oct day awake head fix mouse temporal dynamic stall method reveal minority population susceptible capillary exhibit frequent stall large majority capillary infrequent stall difference oct bessel-2pm repeatability dynamic stall explain difference sensitivity short infrequent stall base scan speed detection time finally stroke cause shift frequently stall capillary subpopulation last 1 week post stroke dynamic stall analysis enable examination physiological methodological contribution stall measure disease model study
40562683,Clinical and genetic determinants of worse sexual experience in male patients with radiographic axial spondyloarthritis: a multimodal study.,"The expression and experience of sexuality is a key part of an individual's self-identity, yet it is often overlooked in clinical settings. This study aims to evaluate the impact of radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (r-axSpA) on sexual experience in male patients, identify contributing factors and explore the potential causal relationship between r-axSpA and erectile dysfunction (ED). We assessed the sexual experience of 113 male patients with r-axSpA and 73 healthy people using the Sexual Experience Questionnaire in the cross-sectional study. Linear regression analysis was used to explore the contributions of clinical factors to worse sexual experience. A two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) design was conducted to examine the potential causal association of r-axSpA with the risk of ED. There was a significant difference in the total sexual experience score between patients with r-axSpA and healthy controls (41.81±8.71 vs 50.23±8.82, p<0.001). Patients with r-axSpA had a worse score in all dimensions of sexual experience, including erectile function, individual satisfaction and couple satisfaction, compared with healthy individuals. In the regression model adjusted for age, disease duration and body mass index, disease activity (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index), physical function (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index), mobility (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index, chest expansion and finger-floor distance), health index (Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society Health Index), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and psychological status (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), HADS-Anxiety and HADS-Depression) were significant determinants of sexual experience. The two-sample MR analysis demonstrated no causal effect of r-axSpA on the risk of ED (OR: 0.973; 95% CI: 0.824 to 1.149; p=0.749) based on the inverse variance weighted method. Sensitivity analyses supported the result, with no evidence of directional pleiotropy. Worse sexual experience was associated with increased disease activity, reduced mobility, lower health index, poor sleep quality and psychological status. Genetic-level evidence indicated no direct causal relationship between r-axSpA and ED. Therefore, actively assessing disease-related suffering and developing new management strategies are essential for improving sexual experience in patients with r-axSpA.",RMD open,2025.0,Lidong Hu; Dai Gao; Xiaojian Ji; Yiwen Wang; Xingkang Liu; Jianglin Zhang; Jian Zhu; Feng Huang,expression experience sexuality key individual self identity overlook clinical setting study aim evaluate impact radiographic axial spondyloarthritis r axspa sexual experience male patient identify contribute factor explore potential causal relationship r axspa erectile dysfunction ed assess sexual experience 113 male patient r axspa 73 healthy people sexual experience questionnaire cross sectional study linear regression analysis explore contribution clinical factor bad sexual experience sample mendelian randomisation mr design conduct examine potential causal association r axspa risk ed significant difference total sexual experience score patient r axspa healthy control 41.81±8.71 vs 50.23±8.82 p<0.001 patient r axspa bad score dimension sexual experience include erectile function individual satisfaction couple satisfaction compare healthy individual regression model adjust age disease duration body mass index disease activity bath ankylose spondylitis disease activity index physical function bath ankylosing spondylitis functional index mobility bath ankylose spondylitis metrology index chest expansion finger floor distance health index assessment spondyloarthritis international society health index sleep quality pittsburgh sleep quality index psychological status hospital anxiety depression scale hads hads anxiety hads depression significant determinant sexual experience sample mr analysis demonstrate causal effect r axspa risk ed 0.973 95 ci 0.824 1.149 p=0.749 base inverse variance weight method sensitivity analysis support result evidence directional pleiotropy bad sexual experience associate increase disease activity reduce mobility low health index poor sleep quality psychological status genetic level evidence indicate direct causal relationship r axspa ed actively assess disease relate suffering develop new management strategy essential improve sexual experience patient r axspa.

We aimed to develop predictive models using MRI-derived brain neuroanatomical features and clinical data to forecast responses to CEIs and SSRIs in ADRD patients. This was a retrospective observational analysis of electronic health records (EHRs) and MRI data conducted within Johns Hopkins Medical Systems. Cohort 1 comprised 179 patients prescribed CEIs or SSRIs for the first time with over a year of follow-up. Cohort 2 included 1244 patients with similar criteria to explore clinical characteristics linked to MRI features affecting treatment benefits. Medication efficacy was assessed via a Likert scale based on EMR descriptions. We quantified brain volumes across 280 anatomical areas on T1-weighted MRIs and applied an elastic net model after harmonizing volumes with the ComBat model. Predictive model efficacy was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Preserved volume in the nucleus basalis of Meynert correlated with better responses to both CEIs and SSRIs. Specific white matter volumes related to CEI benefits, while SSRI efficacy was linked to gray matter in the Nucleus Accumbens and frontal cortex.

Clinical trial methodologies for the treatment of these syndromes are evolving and the first agents to reduce NPS severity has been approved. Biomarkers are rapidly becoming available to guide clinical trial decision-making. Biomarkers can confirm the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and are playing a larger role in non-Alzheimer trials. The Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) specify the elements of clinical trials that must be reported when clinical trials are published. These criteria provide conventions for uniform reporting of all key aspects of a clinical trial and facilitate comparisons across trials. We describe best practices for clinical trials of NPS including research definitions of the NDD, use of biomarkers to support clinical diagnosis, research criteria for NPS, use of rating scales to define the severity of NPS at baseline and as endpoints for the clinical trial, and approaches to data analysis of specific interest in NPS trials.

40562629,Neuroprotective properties of ciliary neurotrophic factor in the retina for the treatment of macular telangiectasia type 2.,"Neurotrophic factors are a family of proteins that promote the growth and survival of both developing and mature neurons. Extensive preclinical studies have demonstrated neuroprotective properties conferred by ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) in a variety of neuron types across several species. Neuroprotection that CNTF confers slows or prevents neuron loss and appears to be agnostic to the nature of the neurodegenerative mutation or injury. However, translation of these studies to the clinic remains a challenge due in part to delivery barriers inherent to the central nervous system and the short half-life of CNTF. The molecular effect of CNTF delivered by a variety of strategies in model systems has been extensively studied in the neural retina. Long-term retinal neuroprotection has been documented using encapsulated cells that have been genetically modified to produce a stable source of CNTF.

CSF culture has variable diagnostic accuracy, requiring up to 48 hours to confirm bacterial growth and sensitivities. Point-of-care multiplex CSF PCR assays can provide a rapid diagnosis, confirming the presence of pathogenic genetic material from a panel within 1 hour. In this report, we describe a case of an adult teenage male with suspected bacterial meningitis, early disseminated intravascular coagulation and septicaemia. After 5 hours, a point-of-care CSF PCR test confirmed meningitis due to <i>N. meningitidis</i> infection.

We present the case of a tween girl, the firstborn child of a non-consanguineous married couple, who developed neurological symptoms following a category three dog bite. The child had received four doses of the rabies vaccine but did not receive Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG). She initially presented with progressive lower limb weakness followed by urinary retention, which eventually progressed to encephalopathy and dystonia. Initial diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome, later as transverse myelitis, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis was considered. Investigations, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, MRI, and Rabies virus neutralising antibody (RVNA) titers, led to a diagnosis of rabies encephalitis.

40562512,The Impact of Cognitive Impairment on Cardiovascular Disease.,"The older adult population is the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population. Cardiovascular disease is common among older patients, which leads to excess morbidity, mortality, and health care utilization. Cognitive impairment is also common in older adults with cardiovascular disease and is expected to increase in parallel with cardiovascular disease because both conditions share the same underlying risk factors. Cardiovascular disease also exacerbates cognitive impairment through hypertension, cerebral hypoperfusion, inflammation, arrhythmia, emboli, and medication adverse events. Moreover, cognitive impairment can undermine the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease because of changes in health literacy, adherence, and even the likelihood that guideline-directed medical and/or interventional management are under-prescribed. Patients with cognitive impairment are also more likely to endure delays in care and reduced participation in formative cardiovascular trials. In this State-of-the-Art review, we aim to: 1) examine the distinct types of cognitive impairment prevalent among cardiac patients; 2) explore the fundamental pathophysiology and mechanisms of cognitive impairment in adults with cardiovascular disease; 3) delineate the bidirectional impact of cognitive impairment and cardiovascular disease; and 4) discuss evidence-based management strategies to mitigate cognitive impairment in patients with cardiovascular diseases.",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,2025.0,Yasser Jamil; Ashok Krishnaswami; Ariela R Orkaby; Marnina Stimmel; Charles H Brown Iv; Adam P Mecca; Daniel E Forman; Michael W Rich; Michael G Nanna; Abdulla A Damluji,old adult population fast grow segment u.s. population cardiovascular disease common old patient lead excess morbidity mortality health care utilization cognitive impairment common old adult cardiovascular disease expect increase parallel cardiovascular disease condition share underlying risk factor cardiovascular disease exacerbate cognitive impairment hypertension cerebral hypoperfusion inflammation arrhythmia emboli medication adverse event cognitive impairment undermine treatment patient cardiovascular disease change health literacy adherence likelihood guideline direct medical and/or interventional management prescribe patient cognitive impairment likely endure delay care reduce participation formative cardiovascular trial state art review aim 1 examine distinct type cognitive impairment prevalent cardiac patient 2 explore fundamental pathophysiology mechanism cognitive impairment adult cardiovascular disease 3 delineate bidirectional impact cognitive impairment cardiovascular disease 4 discuss evidence base management strategy mitigate cognitive impairment patient cardiovascular disease
40562469,Aortic Valve Replacement in Women: A Pooled Analysis of the RHEIA and PARTNER 3 Trials.,"In women with severe aortic stenosis, there are limited data regarding outcome differences following transcatheter (TAVR) vs surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). The authors sought to examine outcomes of TAVR vs SAVR in a patient-level pooled analysis of women in the RHEIA and PARTNER 3 trials. Patients in both trials were randomly allocated to a balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3/Ultra valve or to surgical bioprostheses. Individual patient data of female participants in the 2 trials were pooled. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, all stroke, or rehospitalization at 1 year. A total of 376 women were randomized to TAVR and 336 to SAVR. The mean age was ∼73 years, and the mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score was 2.1%. Kaplan-Meier estimates of event rates at 1 year with TAVR vs SAVR were 8.5% vs 16.8% for the composite of all-cause mortality, all stroke, or rehospitalization (absolute difference -8.2%; 95% CI: -13.1% to -3.3%; P < 0.001), 1.1% vs 2.1% (P = 0.27) for all-cause mortality, 2.7% vs 3.9% (P = 0.35) for all stroke, and 5.4% vs 11.9% (P = 0.002) for rehospitalization. The composite endpoint of all-cause death or stroke was similar between the 2 treatment groups: 3.5% vs 5.4% (absolute difference -1.9%; 95% CI: -5.0% to 1.1%; P = 0.21). Among women with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, TAVR led to a reduction in the rate of the combined endpoint of all-cause mortality, stroke, or rehospitalization at 1-year follow-up, largely due to a significant reduction in the rate of rehospitalization.",JACC.

40562467,15-Year Outcomes of PFO Closure in Patients With Cryptogenic Embolism: Insights From the PROLONG Registry.,"Transcatheter patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure has become the gold-standard treatment for patients with cryptogenic embolism and PFO, but long-term outcomes data are limited. The aim of this study was to report the extended clinical outcomes of patients who underwent transcatheter PFO closure for cryptogenic embolism. PROLONG (PFO Transcatheter Occlusion Long-Term Outcomes National Group) is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, retrospective registry that enrolled patients who underwent transcatheter PFO closure between 1999 and 2013 at 12 centers in Italy. This analysis included only patients who underwent PFO closure for cryptogenic embolism, defined as cryptogenic ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, systemic embolism, or silent ischemic lesions on magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical, imaging, procedural, and follow-up data were collected from electronic health records and telephone interviews. The study included 1,245 patients (mean age 47 ± 12 years, 56% women), with a mean follow-up duration of 14.5 ± 2.4 years. During follow-up, 34 patients (2.7%) experienced recurrent ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism (0.19 per 100 patient-years). Predictors of recurrent events were Risk of Paradoxical Embolism (RoPE) score ≤ 7 (HR: 3.44; 95% CI: 1.06-11.3; P = 0.041), nonprobable PFO-Associated Stroke Causal Likelihood (PASCAL) classification (HR: 2.72; 95% CI: 1.17-6.34; P = 0.020), and new-onset atrial fibrillation (HR: 7.01; 95% CI: 2.45-20.1; P < 0.001). Serious complications were rare (0.4% in hospital, 0.4% during follow-up) and nonfatal. This study confirms the long-term efficacy and safety of transcatheter PFO closure for patients with cryptogenic embolism and PFO in a real-world setting.

Multicentre, assessor blinded, randomised controlled trial. Four centres in mainland China. 50 adults aged 40-65 years with aphasia for more than one year after a single left hemispheric stroke. Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive either C7 neurotomy plus three weeks of intensive SLT or three weeks of intensive SLT only, stratified by treatment centre. The primary outcome was change in score on the 60 item Boston naming test (BNT, scores 0-60, with higher scores indicating better naming function) from baseline to one week after C7 neurotomy plus intensive SLT for three weeks or intensive SLT for three weeks after deferral for one week (control group). Secondary outcomes included change in severity of aphasia using the aphasia quotient, calculated using the western aphasia battery, and patient reported outcomes on quality of life and depression after stroke. From 25 July 2022 to 31 July 2023, 322 out of 1086 patients received a diagnosis of post-stroke aphasia and were screened for eligibility. 50 eligible participants were randomly assigned to treatment groups (25 in each). Mean increase in BNT score was 11.16 points in the neurotomy plus SLT group and 2.72 points in the control group at one month (difference 8.51 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.31 to 11.71, P<0.001). The between group difference in BNT score remained stable at six months (difference 8.26 points, 4.16 to 12.35, P<0.001). In addition, the aphasia quotient improved significantly in the neurotomy plus SLT group versus control group (difference at one month 7.06 points, 4.41 to 9.72, P<0.001), as did patient reported activities of daily living and post-stroke depression. No treatment related severe adverse events were reported. C7 neurotomy plus three weeks of intensive SLT was associated with a greater improvement in language function compared with three weeks of intensive SLT alone over a period of six months.

40562419,"Brexanolone, zuranolone and related neurosteroid GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor positive allosteric modulators for postnatal depression.","Postnatal depression - depression that occurs up to one year after a woman has given birth - is an important and common disorder that can have short- and long-term adverse impacts on the mother, her child and the family as a whole. Recommended treatment for postnatal depression is psychological therapy, and for more severe depression, antidepressants. However, many antidepressants are associated with limited response. Neurosteroid gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptor positive allosteric modulators have been developed for the treatment of depression, including postnatal depression, and have a different mechanism of action than traditional antidepressants. To assess the benefits and harms of brexanolone, zuranolone and related neurosteroid GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor positive allosteric modulators compared to another active treatment (pharmacological, psychological or psychosocial), placebo or treatment as usual for postnatal depression. We searched Cochrane Common Mental Disorders' Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO in January 2024. We also searched two international trials registries and contacted experts in the field to identify the studies that are included in the review. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of women with depression during the first 12 months following childbirth that compared neurosteroid GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor positive allosteric modulators with any other treatment (pharmacological, psychological or psychosocial), placebo or treatment as usual. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. The primary outcomes were depression response, depression remission and adverse events experienced by the mother, nursing baby, or both. The secondary outcomes were depression severity, treatment acceptability, quality of life and parenting- and child-related outcomes. We grouped analyses according to whether the neurosteroid GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor positive allosteric modulator was intravenous or oral. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE criteria. We identified six RCTs (674 women); all were placebo-controlled trials. Three studies tested intravenous brexanolone; one, intravenous ganaxolone; and two studies, oral zuranolone. Sample sizes ranged from 21 to 196. All were conducted in the USA. We judged the risks of selection, performance, detection, attrition and reporting biases to mostly be low, although the risk of selection and attrition bias was unclear in two studies. The biopharmaceutical companies which made the drugs sponsored all six included studies. They appear to have had a considerable role in the design and conduct of the studies. Intravenous neurosteroid GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor positive allosteric modulators versus placebo Low-certainty evidence suggests there may be little or no difference in depression response (risk ratio (RR) 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 2.06; I<sup>2</sup> = 78%; 3 studies, 267 women) or remission (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.38; I<sup>2</sup> = 73%; 3 studies, 267 women) at 30 days (classified in this review as the 'early phase' of treatment: between 0 and 5 weeks from commencement of treatment). There is also probably little or no difference in the number of adverse events affecting the mother (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.48; I<sup>2</sup> = 46%; 4 studies, 325 women; moderate-certainty evidence). There is low-certainty evidence that there may be little or no difference in depression severity (mean difference (MD) -4.22, 95% CI -8.46 to 0.02; I<sup>2</sup> = 78%; 3 studies, 267 women) in the early phase (at 30 days following commencement of treatment); Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) score range 0 to 52. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests lower acceptability than placebo, leading to study dropout (RR 2.77, 95% CI 1.22 to 6.26; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 3 studies, 267 women). No studies measured quality of life or parenting- and child-related outcomes. Oral zuranolone versus placebo Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that zuranolone is probably associated with an improvement in depression response (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.55; I<sup>2</sup> = 13%; 2 studies, 349 women) and remission (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.22; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 2 studies, 349 women) at 45 days from commencement of treatment. Moderate-certainty evidence also suggests that zuranolone probably increases the rate of maternal adverse events (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.48; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 2 studies, 349 women), when all adverse events are considered; the most frequent adverse event was somnolence. Zuranolone is also probably effective in reducing depression severity at day 45 (MD -3.79, 95% CI -5.60 to -1.97; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 2 studies, 349 women; moderate-certainty evidence); HAMD-17 score range 0 to 52. Low-certainty evidence suggests little or no difference in terms of treatment acceptability between zuranolone and placebo (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.81; I<sup>2</sup> = 5%; 2 studies, 349 women). No studies measured quality of life. One study reported the Barkin Index of Maternal Functioning (a validated measure of patient-reported maternal functioning within the first year of childbirth), and found that zuranolone improved maternal functioning at day 45 (MD 7.20, 95% CI 1.42 to 12.98; 153 women), but the certainty of this evidence was low. This review provides moderate-certainty evidence that zuranolone probably improves depression response and remission but also increases maternal adverse events compared to placebo. There may be little or no difference in depression response and remission and probably little or no difference in maternal adverse events with intravenous neurosteroid GABA<sub>A</sub> positive allosteric modulators such as brexanolone, compared to placebo. Evidence from this review, alongside current clinical guidelines and reference to evidence from the general adult population, could be used to inform an individualised risk-benefit discussion with women seeking treatment for postnatal depression. However, it is difficult to make recommendations about the use of neurosteroid GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor positive allosteric modulators for the treatment of postnatal depression as no studies have compared them to active treatment.",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2025.0,Claire A Wilson;

This study examined the impact of youth-level factors (i.e., age, verbal and cognitive ability, adaptive skills) on anxiety self-report completion and parent-youth agreement among 72 autistic adolescents with ID. We also examined if parent accommodation behaviors, such as reassurance or routine modification, served as predictors of parent-youth agreement of anxiety. Results showed that 83% of adolescents completed the self-report measure, with verbal, cognitive, and adaptive ability predicting completion. Parental accommodation predicted parent-youth agreement on physical anxiety symptoms, but not global anxiety symptoms. Youth-level factors did not significantly predict agreement.

Classifying neurocutaneous syndromes based on genetic mechanisms often proves impractical in routine clinical settings. This review proposes a practical classification of neurocutaneous syndromes based on their neurological manifestations, including neoplastic lesions, epilepsy, vascular abnormalities, and ataxia. In this narrative review, we examined original articles and reviews that explore neurocutaneous syndromes, published between January 2000 and July 2024. The figures are part of a personal collection of the authors. Early recognition of dermatological and neurological hallmarks can guide diagnosis and prompt timely evaluation and treatment.

40562372,Delayed cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a narrative review.,"Aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is a condition with elevated mortality and morbidity, which usually affects a working-age population, leading to a high socioeconomic burden. Among those who survive the initial bleeding, approximately 30% will experience delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), which is a significant factor in poor outcomes. However, it is potentially reversible if appropriate treatment is promptly initiated. The amount of blood present on the initial computed tomography (CT) scan, assessed through the modified Fisher scale (mFisher), and the patient's neurological status upon admission, are the strongest predictors of DCI. Early prevention is essential and typically involves administration of enteral nimodipine and the maintenance of euvolemia, while other treatment options have limited supporting evidence. Diagnosing remains a challenge, primarily due to its reliance on clinical examinations. This is more pronounced in high-grade aSAH patients who are unconscious or sedated. In such cases, additional methods may be necessary, such as transcranial Doppler (TCD), continuous electroencephalography (cEEG), or CT with perfusion (CTP). Treatment aims to prevent cerebral infarction and poor clinical outcomes, and it is based on hemodynamic optimization, hypertension induction, cardiac output augmentation, and endovascular therapy. Nevertheless, randomized data on DCI management remains scarce, highlighting the urgent need for more studies and a better understanding of this SAH complication.

40562370,The impact of changing diagnostic criteria on disability in a Brazilian multiple sclerosis cohort.,"Updating multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnostic criteria over recent decades may have impacted disability progression.To assess the effects of the passage of time and changes in diagnostic criteria on disability.A retrospective study of Brazilian people with relapsing-remitting MS from 1994 to 2019. Descriptive analysis compared three periods based on admission: Epoch 1 (1994-2001), 2 (2002-2010), and 3 (2011-2019). Cox regressions were performed for the outcomes of the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) 6.0 and conversion to secondary progressive MS (SPMS). We compared the three Epochs in sequence, the Poser with all McDonald criteria combined, and Poser versus each McDonald criteria (2001, 2005, 2010, and 2017). A multivariate logistic regression assessed the impact of diagnostic criteria on patients reaching EDSS 6.0.Time to diagnosis and treatment decreased across Epochs. For reaching EDSS 6.0, the Cox regression indicated a hazard ratio (HR) 63% lower for Epoch 3 compared with 1, an HR 50% lower for the McDonald criteria combined, and an HR 65% lower for McDonald 2010 compared with Poser. Regarding the conversion to SPMS, the HR was 53% lower for Epoch 3, 48% lower for the McDonald criteria combined, and 64% lower for McDonald 2010. The multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that incomplete recovery of initial symptoms was the main prognostic factor for reaching EDSS 6.0.

40562349,Tobacco smoking is associated with attenuated error monitoring.,"Addiction is associated with neurophysiological deficits in error monitoring (EM), i.e., the continuous assessment of ongoing actions and comparing the outcomes of these actions with internal goals and standards, measured by, e.g., event-related potentials (ERPs). For tobacco smoking, the largest global substance addiction, there is no firm conclusion on the relation with EM due to a paucity of studies. A relatively large gender-balanced sample (N=92, of which 44 smoking participants) performed the Eriksen-flanker task while the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. The error-related negativity (ERN) and the error positivity (Pe) were measured, as well as event-related oscillations (EROs) in the theta and delta frequency bands. The results show a blunted ERN and Pe in smoking participants compared to non-smoking participants, providing evidence for attenuated error detection and salience. Reduced power in transient event-related theta and delta oscillations for smoking participants appeared to underlie the weaker ERN and Pe, respectively. There was no group difference in behavioral performance. Group differences in Pe/Pc, theta, and delta band power remained after robustness testing (i.e., 80% reliability criterium with 18 trials in each condition). Attenuated error monitoring was found for people who smoke tobacco, manifested as a blunted ERN and Pe, which appear to be driven by reduced bursts of theta and delta power, respectively. This shows that tobacco smoking is associated with a robust deficit in EM that has been found in other substance use disorders, and it appears to increase with dependence severity.",Biological psychology,2025.0,C Henrico Stam; Frederik M van der Veen; Vaughn R Steele; Ingmar H A Franken,addiction associate neurophysiological deficit error monitoring em i.e. continuous assessment ongoing action compare outcome action internal goal standard measure e.g. event relate potential erp tobacco smoking large global substance addiction firm conclusion relation em paucity study relatively large gender balanced sample n=92 44 smoking participant perform eriksen flanker task electroencephalogram eeg record error relate negativity ern error positivity pe measure event relate oscillation ero theta delta frequency band result blunt ern pe smoking participant compare non smoking participant provide evidence attenuate error detection salience reduced power transient event relate theta delta oscillation smoking participant appear underlie weak ern pe respectively group difference behavioral performance group difference pe pc theta delta band power remain robustness testing i.e. 80 reliability criterium 18 trial condition attenuate error monitoring find people smoke tobacco manifest blunted ern pe appear drive reduced burst theta delta power respectively show tobacco smoking associate robust deficit em find substance use disorder appear increase dependence severity
40562281,Interplay between Exercise and Neuregulin in providing neuroprotection.,"Exercise has been shown to have a positive impact on brain health including neuroprotective function. It has been demonstrated to increase the synthesis of neurotrophic factors, support neuronal survival, and improve neuroplasticity. Concurrently, neuregulin plays a vital role in the development, maintenance, and repair of both the central and peripheral nervous system. The link between exercise and neuregulin in mediating neuroprotection has been the subject of increased research to better understand the possible applications for the deterrence of neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding this link is of great interest because it has the potential to lead to new strategies for preventing or slowing the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. With an emphasis on exercise-induced neuregulin-mediated neuroprotection, this article reviews the literature on the neuroprotective effects of exercise and neuregulin. The synergistic effects of exercise and neuregulin on neuroprotection will be clarified and valuable insights will be gained from this review, with potential implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Huntington's disease (HD).",Behavioural brain research,2025.0,Jyotsna Sharma; Abhimanyu Thakur; Manjari Rain; Radhika Khosla; Kalyan Maity; Gaurav Raj Mathur; Akshay Anand,exercise show positive impact brain health include neuroprotective function demonstrate increase synthesis neurotrophic factor support neuronal survival improve neuroplasticity concurrently neuregulin play vital role development maintenance repair central peripheral nervous system link exercise neuregulin mediating neuroprotection subject increase research well understand possible application deterrence neurodegenerative disorder understand link great interest potential lead new strategy prevent slow progression neurodegenerative disease emphasis exercise induce neuregulin mediate neuroprotection article review literature neuroprotective effect exercise neuregulin synergistic effect exercise neuregulin neuroprotection clarify valuable insight gain review potential implication development novel therapeutic strategy neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als parkinson disease pd alzheimer disease ad huntington disease hd
40562227,Multi-ingredient energy dietary supplement with a small amount of caffeine modulates central and autonomic nervous system after a single use.,"Most research on the impact of neurostimulatory substances on brain function and human behavior focuses on the adverse effects of their high doses or long-term use. However, little is known about the impact of single doses that contain psychostimulants only in a small amount. Therefore, we investigated the acute effect of an energy dietary multi-ingredient supplement with a low amount of caffeine (55 mg) on the ANS in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (47 participants, 27 women). Previously, we reported its impact on the activity of the CNS through changes in the resting state EEG (rsEEG) pattern and event-related brain potentials by reversing the fatigue-related brain activity. Here, we show that supplementation also influences the ANS through changes in heart electrophysiology. The supplement changed the PRQ and QTc intervals in the ECG signal. In addition, LF power changes were correlated with the changes in rsEEG, which we reported earlier. These findings show that a single dose of dietary supplementation with a much smaller dose of caffeine than in typical caffeinated products may still impact both the CNS and ANS. The results indicate that using such products before electrophysiological examinations in research, diagnostics, and treatment should be considered to control confounding factors. Finally, since the effects were elicited by an energy boost supplement in the mentally fatigued participants, it may be of special importance and enable translation into treatments related to attention, anxiety, mood, and memory disorders.",Neuroscience,2025.0,Karina Maciejewska; Klaudia Duch; Maciej Giza; Aleksandra Nas,research impact neurostimulatory substance brain function human behavior focus adverse effect high dose long term use little know impact single dose contain psychostimulant small investigate acute effect energy dietary multi ingredient supplement low caffeine 55 mg ans double blind placebo control study 47 participant 27 woman previously report impact activity cns change resting state eeg rseeg pattern event relate brain potential reverse fatigue relate brain activity supplementation influence ans change heart electrophysiology supplement change prq qtc interval ecg signal addition lf power change correlate change rseeg report early finding single dose dietary supplementation small dose caffeine typical caffeinate product impact cns ans result indicate product electrophysiological examination research diagnostic treatment consider control confound factor finally effect elicit energy boost supplement mentally fatigue participant special importance enable translation treatment relate attention anxiety mood memory disorder

This systematic review identifies the causes, consequences, and coping strategies associated with emotional fatigue in healthcare workers. A comprehensive search of peer-reviewed articles was conducted across multiple databases. The selection criteria focused on studies that explicitly addressed emotional fatigue, its determinants, impacts, and coping mechanisms. The review identified common causes of emotional fatigue, such as prolonged exposure to high-stress environments, lack of social support, and insufficient recovery time. Consequences include decreased job performance, increased absenteeism, and a higher risk of mental health disorders. Coping strategies include mindfulness practices, organizational support, and the implementation of work-life balance interventions.

40562121,Impact of 7-ketocholesterol on the function and stability of the LAT1 transporter.,"The L-type amino acid transporter (LAT1, SLC7A5) is involved in supplying essential amino acids for brain and fetal development. The regulation of LAT1 function and stability by cholesterol was previously described in ex vivo and in vitro experimental models. The complexity of the relationship between LAT1 and cholesterol has been further studied by investigating the impact of selected oxidized forms of cholesterol, focusing on the most abundant auto-oxidized form of cholesterol, namely 7-ketocholesterol, which increases with age and pathologies characterized by high reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The partial substitution of cholesterol with 7-ketocholesterol in HEK293 cells transiently overexpressing the human LAT1 (HEK293-LAT1), decreases the Vmax of LAT1 mediated transport and the thermal stability of the protein. The impairing effect on transport was directly tested in LAT1 reconstituted proteoliposomes supplemented with 7-ketocholesterol. In this experimental model, it was found that the presence of 7-ketocholesterol altered the transport stimulation by adenosine triphosphate (ATP), as previously described. This was likely due to the higher rigidity of 7-ketocholesterol compared to cholesterol, which alters the membrane/protein interaction, weakening the ATP binding to LAT1. LAT1 transport function was also inhibited when proteoliposomes were supplemented with 7α-hydroxycholesterol or 25-hydroxycholesterol. These deleterious effects may be relevant in chronic pathological conditions characterized by altered cholesterol/oxysterol ratios, ranging from metabolic syndrome to kidney disease and neurological disorders.",Biochemical pharmacology,2025.0,Raffaella Scanga; Mariafrancesca Scalise; Fangrui Xiu; Michele Galluccio; Lara Console; Michele Visentin; Cesare Indiveri,l type amino acid transporter lat1 slc7a5 involve supply essential amino acid brain fetal development regulation lat1 function stability cholesterol previously describe ex vivo vitro experimental model complexity relationship lat1 cholesterol study investigate impact select oxidize form cholesterol focus abundant auto oxidize form cholesterol 7 ketocholesterol increase age pathology characterize high reactive oxygen species ros level partial substitution cholesterol 7 ketocholesterol hek293 cell transiently overexpresse human lat1 hek293 lat1 decrease vmax lat1 mediate transport thermal stability protein impairing effect transport directly test lat1 reconstitute proteoliposome supplement 7 ketocholesterol experimental model find presence 7 ketocholesterol alter transport stimulation adenosine triphosphate atp previously describe likely high rigidity 7 ketocholesterol compare cholesterol alter membrane protein interaction weaken atp bind lat1 lat1 transport function inhibit proteoliposome supplement 7α hydroxycholesterol 25 hydroxycholesterol deleterious effect relevant chronic pathological condition characterize altered cholesterol oxysterol ratio range metabolic syndrome kidney disease neurological disorder
40562107,"Network analysis of intergenerational associations: Parental childhood trauma, depression, anxiety, and adolescent maladaptive traits in depressed youth.","Adolescent depression, comorbid with maladaptive traits, increases the risks of suicide and psychosocial dysfunction, yet intergenerational pathways linking parental childhood trauma, depression, anxiety, and adolescent maladaptive traits remain complex and unclear. This study aimed to use network analysis to investigate these transmission mechanisms in clinically depressed adolescents. This study recruited 138 parent-adolescent pairs (M<sub>age</sub> = 15.92, SD = 1.84 for adolescents; M<sub>age</sub> = 43.65, SD = 5.37 for parents) to complete the assessment. Network analysis was applied to explore the associations between parental trauma, psychopathology, and adolescent maladaptive traits. The results showed that: (1) parental childhood trauma subtypes were linked to adolescent maladaptive traits through parental depression/anxiety; (2) physical abuse and emotional neglect exhibited the highest strength centrality among parental traumas, while impulsive-need for stimulation was the most central maladaptive trait in adolescents; (3) parental depression and anxiety emerged as bridge symptoms, connecting the transmission from parental trauma to adolescent maladaptation.

40562062,Mental state and health-related quality of life in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome under metformin therapy - a prospective study.,"PCOS is one of the most prevalent endocrine disorders among women of reproductive age, often involving obesity, insulin resistance, and mental health challenges that reduce health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Although metformin has been shown to improve HRQOL in PCOS patients, it is unclear whether this effect is due to the drug itself or its metabolic benefits. This study included 66 PCOS patients from the University Medical Center Mainz, in two groups: 31 received metformin (M-group) and 35 received alternative or no treatment (C-group). HRQOL and distress were assessed at baseline and after 6 months using the Modified PCOS-Questionnaire (MPCOSQ) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). At baseline, the M-group had significantly worse metabolic markers, including HOMA-IR, waist circumference, Visceral Adiposity Index, and Fatty Liver Index. By follow-up, this group showed greater improvements in these markers. However, both groups improved similarly in HRQOL and distress. Regression analysis revealed that improvements in HOMA-IR and BMI were associated with better HRQOL scores. Group assignment was not a significant predictor. These findings may indicate that improvements in HRQOL and reduced distress are linked to metabolic changes associated with metformin use, underscoring the potential relevance of addressing metabolic health in treatment approaches.",Journal of psychosomatic obstetrics and gynaecology,2025.0,Konstantin Hofmann; Susanne Singer; Susanne Theis; Anna Dionysopoulou; Lina Schiestl; Yaman Degirmenci; Annette Hasenburg; Roxana Schwab; Christine Skala,pcos prevalent endocrine disorder woman reproductive age involve obesity insulin resistance mental health challenge reduce health relate quality life hrqol metformin show improve hrqol pcos patient unclear effect drug metabolic benefit study include 66 pcos patient university medical center mainz group 31 receive metformin m group 35 receive alternative treatment c group hrqol distress assess baseline 6 month modified pcos questionnaire mpcosq hospital anxiety depression scale hads baseline m group significantly bad metabolic marker include homa ir waist circumference visceral adiposity index fatty liver index follow group show great improvement marker group improve similarly hrqol distress regression analysis reveal improvement homa ir bmi associate well hrqol score group assignment significant predictor finding indicate improvement hrqol reduce distress link metabolic change associate metformin use underscore potential relevance address metabolic health treatment approach
40562057,[Basic knowledge of drug pain therapy in the palliative situation].,"This review provides an overview of the basic knowledge of drug pain therapy in the palliative situation. Pain is one of the main symptoms in 60 to 90% of cancer patients. Pain also develops with neurological and other diseases that occur in end-of-life situations. To address this symptom, a holistic strategy is required that encompasses all physical, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects of the multi-dimensional pain experience (""total pain"" concept).Drug treatment for cancer pain has been based on a stepwise approach for many years, starting with non-opioid analgesics, followed by moderate and strong opioids. In contrast, today's pain management is determined more by the actual intensity of this aversive event.The pain assessment should be tailored to identify a nociceptive vs. a neuropathic pain component that needs to be challenged by the most appropriate drug therapies. Non-opioid analgesics are ideal substances for relieving nociceptive pain. Antidepressants and anticonvulsants reduce the intensity of new neuropathic pain. Opioids are suitable for all types of pain, but are restricted to a second-line choice. Among all opioids are Tilidine and Tramadol prodrugs, which only relieve pain after activation in the liver. Drug-drug interactions may also block this activation. Rapid release opioids should be used for break-through cancer pain. Transdermal opioid applications are recommended in case of swallowing disorders, but usually not to initiate pain control. An opioid change can be performed if side effects such as hallucinations for the selected opioid are more pronounced than the pain reduction.",Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),2025.0,Sascha Weber; Angelika Lampert; Julia C Stingl; Vera Peuckmann-Post; Sonja Hiddemann; Frank Elsner; Irene Neuner; Roman Rolke,review provide overview basic knowledge drug pain therapy palliative situation pain main symptom 60 90 cancer patient pain develop neurological disease occur end life situation address symptom holistic strategy require encompass physical psychological social spiritual aspect multi dimensional pain experience total pain concept).drug treatment cancer pain base stepwise approach year start non opioid analgesic follow moderate strong opioid contrast today pain management determine actual intensity aversive event pain assessment tailor identify nociceptive vs. neuropathic pain component need challenge appropriate drug therapy non opioid analgesic ideal substance relieve nociceptive pain antidepressant anticonvulsant reduce intensity new neuropathic pain opioid suitable type pain restrict second line choice opioid tilidine tramadol prodrug relieve pain activation liver drug drug interaction block activation rapid release opioid break cancer pain transdermal opioid application recommend case swallow disorder usually initiate pain control opioid change perform effect hallucination select opioid pronounced pain reduction
40562008,"Diagnostic Delays Are Common, and Classic Presentations Are Rare in Spinal Epidural Abscess.","Spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is a rare surgical emergency of the spine that can result in permanent neurological injury if not diagnosed and treated in a timely manner. Because early presentation can appear similar to benign back or neck pain, delays in diagnosis may be relatively common. We sought an improved understanding of the characteristics associated with SEA and frequency of delays in SEA diagnosis. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients with new magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed SEA from January 1, 2016-December 31, 2019 in an integrated healthcare system. We applied electronic data abstraction and focused manual chart review to describe potentially SEA-related ambulatory and emergency visits in the 30 days prior to SEA diagnosis, and patient characteristics including comorbidities, potential risk factors, and presenting signs and symptoms. We described the frequency of potential delays in diagnosis and of previously described clinical characteristics and risk factors for SEA. Spinal epidural abscess was diagnosed in 457 patients during the study period, 178 (39%) of whom were female, with median age 63 years (interquartile range 45-81 years). More than two-thirds of patients had at least one visit prior to diagnosis (323, 71%), and SEA location was most commonly the lumbar spine (235, 51%). Although over 90% of patients presented with back or neck pain or tenderness, the classic triad of back pain, fever, and neurologic symptoms was present in only 10% of patients. Diabetes mellitus and infection in the prior 90 days were common, while injection drug use, chronic steroid use, HIV infection, and solid organ transplant were rare. In an integrated healthcare system, 71% of patients with spinal epidural abscess had potentially related ambulatory care or emergency visits in the 30 days prior to diagnosis.

40562002,Effects of Emergency Department Training on Buprenorphine Prescribing and Opioid Use Disorder-Associated ED Revisits: Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Prescribing patients buprenorphine from the emergency department (ED) is recommended by multiple organizations. However, it is unclear how best to encourage physicians to prescribe buprenorphine from the ED. Our objectives in this study were to examine the effects of a departmental-wide training initiative for emergency physicians to prescribe buprenorphine, increase buprenorphine prescribing, and decrease ED re-utilization for opioid use disorder (OUD) complications. We performed this retrospective cohort study at an academic medical center. Beginning May 1, 2018, the ED started a buprenorphine-education initiative and tracked the proportion of clinicians who obtained buprenorphine-prescribing certification over the following 16 months. We identified adult patients referred to an addiction clinic from the ED during this period. Our primary outcome was the proportion of patients who received a buprenorphine prescription from the ED. Secondary outcomes included ED re-utilization for OUD complications and buprenorphine refills, as well as follow-up in the bridge clinic within 30 days. The proportion of physicians eligible to prescribe buprenorphine increased from 37% to 88% over the study period, and 430 patients were referred to an addiction clinic. The proportion of patients referred to a bridge program who received a buprenorphine prescription increased from 50% during the first month compared to 92% during month 16 (odds ratio 1.14, 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.21 per month).

40562000,Dispatch Decisions and Emergency Medical Services Response in the Prehospital Care of Status Epilepticus.,"Emergency medical dispatch is intended to ensure that emergency medical services (EMS) allocate appropriate resources for the treatment of patients with status epilepticus (SE). However, it is unclear whether dispatch algorithms accurately identify those patients having a seizure-related medical emergency and how dispatch algorithms influence what prehospital resources are allocated for the encounter. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of prehospital encounters for SE using data from the 2019 ESO Data Collaborative. We included patients who were ≥18 years of age, had an EMS diagnostic impression of SE, and did not have a cardiac arrest. We examined the dispatch-determined complaint designated by the emergency medical dispatch (EMD) code, dispatch-determined level of acuity (A, B, C, D), ambulance response, and training level of the responding prehospital professional. Of the 18,515 patient encounters for SE with an EMD code, 8,279 (44.9%) were women, and the mean age was 40.0 years (SD 19.7). There were 13,829 (75%) encounters that received a dispatch code for seizures/convulsions and 4,686 (25%) with a dispatch code for a non-seizure-related condition. Among encounters for SE identified by dispatch as seizures/convulsions, 6,412 (46.4%) were designated high acuity, 6,626 (63.6%) were designated low acuity, and the majority received emergent ambulance responses (98.1% among those designated high acuity and 81.8% among those designated low acuity) and an Advanced Life Support-trained responder (93.7% among those designated high acuity and 92.7% among those designated low acuity). Median response times were similar for all acuity levels (9.1, 8.8, 9.1, and 8.3 minutes for A-D, respectively). Approximately one-fourth of SE cases were categorized as a non-seizure related condition at dispatch, and fewer than half received the highest acuity determinant code. Despite this, dispatch-assigned acuity did not have a strong relationship with the ambulance response or training level of the EMS responder or response time, suggesting that use of dispatch algorithms might be further optimized and highlighting a potential area to improve quality of EMS care.",The western journal of emergency medicine,2025.0,Robert P McInnis; Andrew J Wood; Courtney L Shay; Anna A Haggart; Remle P Crowe; Elan L Guterman,"emergency medical dispatch intend ensure emergency medical service ems allocate appropriate resource treatment patient status epilepticus se unclear dispatch algorithm accurately identify patient have seizure relate medical emergency dispatch algorithm influence prehospital resource allocate encounter perform cross sectional analysis prehospital encounter se datum 2019 eso data collaborative include patient ≥18 year age ems diagnostic impression se cardiac arrest examine dispatch determine complaint designate emergency medical dispatch emd code dispatch determine level acuity b c d ambulance response training level respond prehospital professional 18,515 patient encounter se emd code 8,279 44.9 woman mean age 40.0 year sd 19.7 13,829 75 encounter receive dispatch code seizure convulsion 4,686 25 dispatch code non seizure relate condition encounter se identify dispatch seizure convulsion 6,412 46.4 designate high acuity 6,626 63.6 designate low acuity majority receive emergent ambulance response 98.1 designate high acuity 81.8 designate low acuity advanced life support train responder 93.7 designate high acuity 92.7 designate low acuity median response time similar acuity level 9.1 8.8 9.1 8.3 minute d respectively approximately fourth se case categorize non seizure relate condition dispatch few half receive high acuity determinant code despite dispatch assign acuity strong relationship ambulance response training level ems responder response time suggest use dispatch algorithm optimize highlight potential area improve quality ems care"
40561989,"""Oh, Another Overdose, for the Love of Pete"": First Responder Perspectives on Overdose Response Technology.","Overdose response applications and hotlines are novel overdose response technologies (ORT)/virtual harm reduction strategies that have recently emerged as a strategy to reduce the harms associated with the ongoing opioid epidemic. First responders are often the first point of contact for people who have overdosed and play a significant role in responses enacted by these services. In this study our aim was to explore the attitudes and perceptions of first responders on these novel technologies. We recruited 17 participants using purposive sampling through the province of Alberta between February-April 2023 including 11 paramedics, two firefighters, and five emergency communications operators. To be included in the study, participants were required to be older than 18 years of age, have the ability to communicate effectively in English, provide verbal informed consent, and work in an emergency responder role. Semi-structured interviews were conducted by two evaluators. When reviewing interview transcripts we used thematic analysis to identify key themes and subthemes. Participants discussed their current operating procedures, their current perspectives on overdose response hotlines and apps, how they would best integrate them into their current workloads, and how to raise awareness of these services within first-responder communities. Participants were apprehensive about the integration of these services into their current workloads, including their potential benefits, and raised concerns about their efficacy within communities of people who use drugs. Key strategies were raised for the successful integration of these services into emergency responses including providing information to clients and the feasibility of overdose responses by the general public. This study's results add to the existing literature on the toll of the overdose epidemic seen within first-response communities.

40561986,Practical Status and Social Background of Current Mobile Stroke Units Worldwide: A Survey and Investigation.,"We aimed to clarify the current challenges involved in introducing and operating mobile stroke units (MSU) in new regions, considering the social background of regions with MSUs. We conducted a questionnaire survey on the operational and financial status of all active MSU programs worldwide as of March 2023, and investigated the demographic, economic, and healthcare backgrounds of areas with and without active MSUs. We compared the data for the two groups at the country, state, or city level. We then correlated data gathered from the survey and the investigation. Of the 33 MSU programs contacted, 19 (59%) responded. The responding programs treated a range of 52-1,663 (median 781) patients at an MSU per year. The most commonly reported hours of operation were eight hours every weekday (5, 26%). The majority had four staff on board (11, 58%). No physicians were on board in six MSUs (32%). The catchment area radius ranged from 5-250 (median 22) kilometers. The start-up costs and subsequent annual operation costs of an MSU ranged from $0.7-1.8 million (median 1.0) and $0.7-1.7 (median 1.0) million US dollars, respectively. Reimbursement was obtained by eight (47%), with full reimbursement by two (12%). A negative gross financial balance was reported in eight MSUs (53%, of 15), and a financial challenge was reported in 17 (94%, of 18). Compared to the non-MSU group at the country level, active MSU groups had a significantly higher population, nominal gross domestic product, healthcare access and quality index, and physician density. They also had significantly lower age-standardized stroke incidence rates and age-standardized stroke disability-adjusted life year rate. The MSU operation time was significantly positively correlated with age-standardized stroke incidence rate and negatively with physician density. Despite facing serious financial problems, mobile stroke units currently operate around the world. However, the social context of MSUs appears relatively advanced.

40561983,Exposure to Community Violence and Adverse Childhood Experiences in the Emergency Department.,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and exposure to community violence are public health issues linked to negative mental and physical health outcomes. The emergency department (ED) can play a critical role in the care of patients with a history of trauma exposure. Unfortunately, patients' experiences often go unidentified, leading to missed opportunities to address and prevent further harm. We administered a 22-question survey of trauma exposure in ED patients to 1) identify the prevalence of exposure to community violence and ACEs and resulting post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and 2) determine perceived social service needs. This self-administered survey study was conducted on a convenience sample of 267 adult patients at one academic hospital in Chicago, IL, between July 2018-December 2019. This ED sees approximately 70,000 patients annually. These were fluent English-speaking patients who were non-critically ill or altered and chosen randomly after being assigned to an ED room, typically during regular business hours based on research associate availability. They were not offered compensation for study participation. The survey included demographic information and questions modified from the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study questionnaire, the 54-item Survey of Exposure to Community Violence, and the Primary Care PTSD screen. Participants were also asked to identify resources to address their exposure to trauma. Of 268 surveys, 267 were completed; 88% of participants endorsed exposure to ACEs or community violence (95% confidence interval [CI] 84.1-91.9%, p < 0.001 compared to general US population rate of 61%). A total of 53.6% of respondents endorsed exposure to at least one ACE (95% CI, 47.6-59.6%), and 15.7% were exposed to ≥4 ACE (95% CI, 11.3-20.1%). The most commonly endorsed categories of ACE were ""emotional neglect"" (30.3%, 95% CI 24.8%-35.8%); ""emotional abuse"" (25.8%, 95% CI 20.6%-31.1%); and ""exposure to family substance use"" (21%, 95% CI 16.1%-25.9%). When asked about personal experience with violence in the community, 47.9% said they had been shoved, kicked or punched (95% CI 41.9%-53.9%), 8% had been stabbed (95% CI 4.8%-11.3%), and 6.7% had been shot (95% CI 3.7%-9.7%). Among the survey participants, 26.2% said they had seen someone die from violence either in their home or in their neighborhood (95% CI 20.9%-31.5%). ZIP Code analysis indicates that most patients resided in neighborhoods near our ED and were likely to utilize it for medical care. Of respondents with exposure to trauma 38% asked for resources through their primary care clinic (95% CI 32.2%-43.8%), while 77.4% asked for resources through faith-based organizations (95% CI 72.4%-82.4%). These findings suggest that most respondents in the ED have experienced trauma, and many are interested in community and clinical resources.

40561979,Post-Concussion Syndrome Following Blast Injury: A Cross-Sectional Study of Beirut Blast Casualties.,"The massive 2020 blast in Beirut, Lebanon, caused by improperly stored ammonium nitrate, was one of the most powerful non-nuclear explosions in history, Following the blast, head injuries emerged as a predominant presentation to the emergency department (ED). Blast-induced head injuries can lead to mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) mediated via primary blast overpressure without direct head trauma. The recovery process from mTBIs can be prolonged and affected by several factors. If symptoms persist for more than three months, patients should be evaluated for post-concussion syndrome (PCS). While clinical blast-injury studies have focused on repetitive blast exposure, this study evaluates a cohort exposed to a single blast. We hypothesized that a single blast exposure is sufficient to induce PCS symptoms similar to those exposed to repetitive blasts. This cross-sectional study explores PCS in patients presenting to the ED of a tertiary-care center following the Beirut blast. Patients were identified through medical charts, contacted by phone, and consented to participate at least three months post-blast (beginning in November 2020). We used the Rivermead Post-Concussion Questionnaire (RPQ) to assess for PCS. We analyzed the association of PCS with patients and injury characteristics. Of 370 patients presenting to the ED, 145 (58.5%) completed the study questionnaire. Mean age was 39.8 ± 15.4 years, and 40% were females. Head trauma (46.9%) was the most common presentation. A total of 112 patients (77.2%) met the criteria for PCS, with a median RPQ score of 25 (interquartile range 18.75). After adjusting for injury types and distance from the blast, younger patients (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.972, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.947-0.998) and females (aOR 2.836, 95% CI 1.114-7.220) were more likely to suffer from PCS. Our study revealed a remarkably high prevalence of PCS among survivors of the Beirut blast, with younger individuals and females disproportionately affected. This highlights the need for age- and sex-specific rehabilitation and support programs. However, the study was limited by incomplete patients records and contact information, leading to the exclusion of a significant number of patients who initially presented to the ED. Ultimately, this study underscores the crucial role of robust public health preparedness and specialized care pathways against future large-scale catastrophes. Further assessment, including neurobiomarker evaluation, will be conducted on these survivors.",The western journal of emergency medicine,2025.0,Hind Anan; Moustafa Al Hariri; Eveline Hitti; Firas Kobeissy; Afif Mufarrij,massive 2020 blast beirut lebanon cause improperly store ammonium nitrate powerful non nuclear explosion history follow blast head injury emerge predominant presentation emergency department ed blast induce head injury lead mild traumatic brain injury mtbi mediate primary blast overpressure direct head trauma recovery process mtbis prolong affect factor symptom persist month patient evaluate post concussion syndrome pcs clinical blast injury study focus repetitive blast exposure study evaluate cohort expose single blast hypothesize single blast exposure sufficient induce pcs symptom similar expose repetitive blast cross sectional study explore pcs patient present ed tertiary care center follow beirut blast patient identify medical chart contact phone consent participate month post blast begin november 2020 rivermead post concussion questionnaire rpq assess pcs analyze association pcs patient injury characteristic 370 patient present ed 145 58.5 complete study questionnaire mean age 39.8 ± 15.4 year 40 female head trauma 46.9 common presentation total 112 patient 77.2 meet criterion pcs median rpq score 25 interquartile range 18.75 adjust injury type distance blast young patient adjust odd ratio aor 0.972 95 confidence interval ci 0.947 0.998 female aor 2.836 95 ci 1.114 7.220 likely suffer pcs study reveal remarkably high prevalence pcs survivor beirut blast young individual female disproportionately affect highlight need age- sex specific rehabilitation support program study limit incomplete patient record contact information lead exclusion significant number patient initially present ed ultimately study underscore crucial role robust public health preparedness specialized care pathway future large scale catastrophe assessment include neurobiomarker evaluation conduct survivor
40561962,"Epidemiology of 911 Calls for Opioid Overdose in Nogales, Arizona.","Drug overdose is the leading cause of unintentional death in the United States, and individuals identifying as BIPOC (Black, indigenous and people of color) and those of low socioeconomic status are over-represented in this statistic. The US-Mexico border faces several unique challenges when it comes to healthcare and the drug overdose crisis, due in large part to health inequities. Although the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that overdose prevention programs address health inequities, little is known about opioid overdoses in this rural, primarily Spanish-speaking region. As emergency medical services (EMS) records collect countywide data, they represent a high-quality source for epidemiologic surveillance. We conducted a retrospective chart review based on a local quality assurance program in which two years of EMS records were reviewed with the primary objective of characterizing patients receiving prehospital care for opioid overdoses in a rural, borderland community, and the secondary objective of characterizing EMS's fidelity to a naloxone distribution protocol. We included electronic patient care records for analysis if they included the EMS clinician's impression of overdose, opiate abuse, or opiate-related disorder from November 1, 2020-October 31,2022. The following data points were abstracted: date; patient initials/gender/age; police presence; response location; bystanders on scene; naloxone administration prior to EMS arrival; distribution of naloxone kit (yes/no); substance reported; and disposition. We analyzed descriptive statistics. A total of 74 cases met inclusion criteria over two years with the majority of cases involving men (82%) with a median age of 28. Almost half of overdoses occurred at private residences (46%), and slightly more than half (57%) reported fentanyl use prior to overdose.

Sleep architecture changes significantly with age. Odds Ratio Product (ORP) is a novel continuous index of sleep depth, which provides insights into age-related changes in sleep depth. This study investigates the interaction of sex, body mass index (BMI) and mental on age-related changes in sleep architecture, measured with ORP in community-dwelling adults using at-home polysomnography (PSG). We measured sleep architecture using ORP in 195 middle-aged to older (>50 years) sedentary but healthy adults and a younger cohort (<35 years, n = 34). All sleep nights utilized MY scoring (Cerebra Medical, Winnipeg Manitoba) to calculate traditional sleep architecture values, average ORP in different sleep stages and percent of time in different ORP deciles. Differences between groups were assessed using ANOVA models. Mental health was assessed using standardized questionnaires linear regression models were used to report the relationship between age and sleep architecture, ORP, and interactions between sex, BMI, anxiety and depression. Significant interactions were present for body mass index, deep sleep deciles, and the awake stage. Confirming previous findings, we report reduced deep sleep, increased light sleep and more full wakefulness in middle-aged to older adults, consistent with decreased sleep pressure with aging.

To evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of SSRDs in patients referred to a tertiary neuroimmunology clinic. We retrospectively evaluated the presence of SSRDs in patients referred to a tertiary neuroimmunology clinic from 2016 to 2023. 898 patients were referred; 204 (22.7 %) did not have a neuroimmunological disorder. Fifty-four patients (6.0 % of total; 26.5 % of non-neuroimmunological) were diagnosed with SSRDs (74 % females, average age 42.5, SD 10.9). Per the DSM5-TR criteria, the following categories were identified: functional neurological disorder (25 patients, 46.3 %), somatic symptom disorder (22 patients, 40.7 %), SSRD unspecified (4 patients, 7.4 %), and illness anxiety disorder (3 patients, 5.5 %). Forty-three patients (79.6 %) were referred for MS, and 10 (18.5 %) for autoimmune encephalitis.

40561790,"Cannabis use, risk of cannabis use disorder, and anxiety and depression among bisexual patients: A comparative study of sex and sexual identity differences in a large health system.","This study used electronic health record (EHR) data from 9869 sexual minority patients aged 18 and older who had a primary care visit within a Los Angeles university health system (June 2020-May 2023). Sexual minority patients, defined as lesbian, gay, or bisexual, were screened for cannabis use and risk of cannabis use disorder (CUD) during annual wellness visits. Mental health diagnoses were extracted from patients' EHR. Multivariable regression models were used to assess associations between sexual identity, sex, and cannabis-related outcomes, including cannabis use, risk of CUD, mental health diagnoses among individuals reporting cannabis use, and cannabis use for symptom management among those with a corresponding diagnosis. All models controlled for age and race/ethnicity. Bisexual patients had higher adjusted odds of cannabis use compared to gay/lesbian patients (AOR females: 1.67; males: 1.47). Bisexual males had greater odds of risk of CUD (AOR: 1.48) and depression diagnosis (AOR:1.86) compared to gay males. Bisexual males with a diagnosis for depression had higher odds of cannabis use for managing depression or sadness symptoms (AOR: 2.44) compared to gay males. Bisexual females had higher odds of a severe stress diagnosis compared to gay/lesbian females (AOR: 2.44). These findings emphasize the importance of developing targeted primary care approaches that address both cannabis use and mental health concerns among bisexual patients. While the prevalence of cannabis use is higher among sexual minorities as compared to their heterosexual counterparts, few studies have examined the differences in cannabis use across sex and sexual identity among sexual minority individuals, especially in the context of health care. This study examines the association of sexual identity and sex with cannabis use, risk of cannabis use disorder (CUD), symptoms managed with cannabis use, and mental health diagnoses among sexual minority primary care patients. We conducted a cross-sectional study using electronic health record (EHR) data from 9869 patients ≥ 18 years of age who identified as sexual minority, defined as lesbian, gay, or bisexual, and had a primary care visit between June 2020 and May 2023 within a university-based health system in Los Angeles, CA. Routine screening for past 3-month cannabis use and risk of CUD was based on the Alcohol Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) and was conducted as part of all annual wellness visits. Patients were asked to report symptoms for which they used cannabis, and mental health diagnoses were extracted from patients' EHR. Diagnoses meeting clinical threshold criteria were identified based on the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes and included anxiety disorders (ICD-10 F41), depressive disorders (ICD-10 F33), and severe stress (ICD-10 F43). Differences in the prevalence of cannabis use by sociodemographic characteristics were stratified by sex and compared across sexual identity using chi-squared tests for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for continuous variables. Multivariable regression models were used to assess associations between sexual identity, sex, and cannabis-related outcomes, including cannabis use in the past 3 months, risk of CUD, mental health diagnoses among individuals reporting cannabis use, and cannabis use for symptom management among those with a corresponding diagnosis. All models controlled for age and race/ethnicity. Among the 9869 patients included in this study, 30.7 % reported cannabis use in the past 3 months. Bisexual patients had higher adjusted odds of cannabis use in comparison to gay/lesbian patients in both females and males (female adjusted odds ratio (AOR):1.67; 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) 1.46, 1.92; male AOR: 1.47; 95 % CI 1.24, 1.73). Among males reporting cannabis use, bisexual individuals had greater odds of risk of CUD (AOR: 1.48; 95 % CI: 1.14, 1.93) and depression diagnosis (AOR: 1.86; 95 % CI: 1.34, 2.56) compared to gay males. Bisexual males with a diagnosis for depression had higher odds of cannabis use for managing depression or sadness symptoms (AOR: 2.44; 95 % CI: 1.34, 4.52) compared to gay males. Among females reporting cannabis use, bisexual patients had higher odds of a severe stress diagnosis compared to gay/lesbian females (AOR: 2.44; 95 % CI: 1.45, 4.35). These findings highlight the need for primary care providers to consider the unique experiences of bisexual patients, particularly regarding mental health and cannabis use.

40561726,"Perspectives on psychotherapy in Southeast Asia: Insights from psychiatrists and trainees (Part I: Attitudes, current practices and training preferences).","Psychotherapy is an evidence-based treatment for mental disorders. Despite its global development, neuroscientific advances, and measurable efficacy, attitudes toward psychotherapy in Southeast Asia (SEA) remain underexplored, particularly among psychiatrists and psychiatric trainees. This study aimed to assess attitudes toward psychotherapy, its current use in clinical practice, and stated preferences for future training among psychiatrists and trainees in SEA. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted across Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. The questionnaire explored perspectives on psychotherapy and its integration into practice. Data were analyzed descriptively and comparatively. Of 253 respondents, 149 (58.9 %) were psychiatrists and 104 (41.1 %) were psychiatric trainees. Both groups exhibited positive attitudes toward psychotherapy, recognizing its professional value, clinical efficacy, and integration with pharmacotherapy. Combination therapy was frequently used; pharmacotherapy dominated for severe disorders, psychotherapy for adjustment and personality disorders, and ECT primarily for schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder. Commonly used therapies include cognitive behavioral therapy, supportive psychotherapy, and mindfulness-based approaches. Psychiatrists favored expanding the number of psychotherapists, while trainees expressed stronger interest in advanced psychodynamic techniques and psychoanalysis. Both groups advocated for additional training in evidence-based psychotherapies and foundational clinical skills. Psychiatrists and trainees in SEA value psychotherapy and its relevance to both clinical practice and everyday life.

40561721,Frontal alpha asymmetry in major depression and comorbid anxiety disorder: a five-year follow-up study.,"Major depression (MD) and anxiety disorders are both associated with higher left compared to right frontal alpha activity (rLFα). The aim of the study was to examine whether young adults with lifetime MD and anxiety disorder differ from healthy controls and whether this pattern remains stable over five years from adolescence into adulthood. Resting frontal EEG asymmetry of n = 25 young adults with lifetime MD and anxiety (MDAnx) and n = 26 healthy controls (HC) was compared. Moreover, in a subsample of participants, the stability of frontal alpha asymmetry was analyzed from adolescence to young adulthood via intra-class-correlations. Participants with MDAnx displayed significantly more rLFα than HCs. Asymmetry showed fair stability over 5 years in the MDAnx group and poor stability in the HC group, the latter driven by increased relative right frontal alpha activity. Increased rLFα could be a trait marker for comorbid MDAnx. Low stability in the HC group could derive from maturation of cognitive and affective processes, which might be impeded by the presence of lifetime MDAnx. Results highlight that EEG asymmetry changes from adolescence to adulthood and could be impacted by lifetime MD and anxiety, irrespective of current symptomatology.",Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,2025.0,Carolin Zsigo; Ellen Greimel; Jürgen Bartling; Gerd Schulte-Körne; Lisa Feldmann,major depression md anxiety disorder associate high left compare right frontal alpha activity rlfα aim study examine young adult lifetime md anxiety disorder differ healthy control pattern remain stable year adolescence adulthood rest frontal eeg asymmetry n = 25 young adult lifetime md anxiety mdanx n = 26 healthy control hc compare subsample participant stability frontal alpha asymmetry analyze adolescence young adulthood intra class correlation participant mdanx display significantly rlfα hcs asymmetry show fair stability 5 year mdanx group poor stability hc group drive increase relative right frontal alpha activity increase rlfα trait marker comorbid mdanx low stability hc group derive maturation cognitive affective process impede presence lifetime mdanx result highlight eeg asymmetry change adolescence adulthood impact lifetime md anxiety irrespective current symptomatology
40561715,Trial-by-trial ERP-behavior relationships in psychosis: Between- and within-person variability in performance monitoring adjustments.,"Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, characterized by deficits in performance monitoring, predicts clinical and functional outcomes. The error-related negativity (ERN), a neurophysiological index of error detection, is reduced in psychosis, but it is unclear why this impaired error detection is not closely linked to behavioral adjustments. A possibility is that research has overrelied on examining between-person relationships of average ERN and behavior, rather than focusing on within-person, trial-by-trial changes. This study aimed to determine whether neurophysiological indices of error detection (ERN, error positivity [Pe]) predict within-person post-error behavioral adjustments in psychotic disorders and whether these relationships are weaker in people with psychosis than in controls. ERN and Pe were assessed during a flanker task in 72 participants with psychosis (PwP) and 82 healthy comparison participants. Multilevel location-scale models examined trial-by-trial changes in the relationships between event-related potentials (ERPs) and behavior (response [RTs], accuracy). Results showed that ERP-RT relationships were similar across PwP and controls. In both groups, greater within-person increases in ERN predicted longer and more variable RTs following correct trials. Larger within-person increases in Pe predicted shorter and more variable RTs following correct trials, but less variable RTs following error trials. Exploratory analyses in a subset of participants with schizophrenia showed similar effects. ERP-accuracy relationships were neither observed nor moderated by diagnostic group. Within-person ERP-behavior relationships were preserved in psychosis, indicating intact performance monitoring at the individual level. This supports performance monitoring as a transdiagnostic construct and underscores the importance of examining intraindividual variability to understand performance monitoring in psychotic disorders.",Schizophrenia research,2025.0,Bohyun Park; Amanda Holbrook; Philippe Rast; Gregory A Light; Dan Foti; Roman Kotov; Peter E Clayson,cognitive impairment schizophrenia characterize deficit performance monitoring predict clinical functional outcome error relate negativity ern neurophysiological index error detection reduce psychosis unclear impair error detection closely link behavioral adjustment possibility research overrelie examine person relationship average ern behavior focus person trial trial change study aim determine neurophysiological index error detection ern error positivity pe predict person post error behavioral adjustment psychotic disorder relationship weak people psychosis control ern pe assess flanker task 72 participant psychosis pwp 82 healthy comparison participant multilevel location scale model examine trial trial change relationship event relate potential erps behavior response rt accuracy result show erp rt relationship similar pwp control group great person increase ern predict long variable rt follow correct trial large person increase pe predict short variable rt follow correct trial variable rt follow error trial exploratory analyse subset participant schizophrenia show similar effect erp accuracy relationship observe moderate diagnostic group person erp behavior relationship preserve psychosis indicate intact performance monitoring individual level support performance monitoring transdiagnostic construct underscore importance examine intraindividual variability understand performance monitoring psychotic disorder
40561713,Sharing drug checking results in a Canadian setting: a multi-site analysis.,"Drug checking services (DCS) have been implemented as a harm reduction measure to address high rates of illicit drug morbidity and mortality. In addition to reducing individual-level risk, there is also potential for DCS users to increase community level awareness of drug market conditions through sharing of drug checking results. However, little is known about the patterns of information sharing among people who use DCS. Data were derived from a cross-sectional study conducted at 22 community harm reduction sites offering DCS across British Columbia (BC) between March 2021 and July 2024. Two variable selection methods - backwards stepwise selection and elastic net regularization - were used to fit models which explored the relationships between select socio-demographic characteristics, drug use patterns and experiences with drug checking with the main outcome measure: sharing drug checking results. 516 participants were included in the study (34 % women, median age 42); 274 (53 %) reported that they shared their drug checking results. Factors significantly and positively associated with sharing results in multivariable logistic regression analysis using both selection methods included: drug dealing, using DCS more than once, stable employment and white ethnicity. Among participants who reported they shared their drug checking results, 66 % reported sharing results with friends and family and 28 % reported sharing results with their drug dealer. This study revealed that over half the study sample shared their drug checking results with others, with results sharing being positively associated with recent drug dealing, frequent DCS utilisation, employment and ethnicity. Drug checking results were most often shared with friends, family and drug dealers. These findings extend the evidence base of DCS as a harm reduction tool by demonstrating how engagement with DCS facilitates information dissemination amongst drug market actors.",The International journal on drug policy,2025.0,Joshua Bird; Samuel Tobias; Cameron Grant; Mark Lysyshyn; Kenneth Tupper; Evan Wood; Thomas Kerr; Lianping Ti,drug checking service dcs implement harm reduction measure address high rate illicit drug morbidity mortality addition reduce individual level risk potential dcs user increase community level awareness drug market condition sharing drug checking result little know pattern information sharing people use dcs datum derive cross sectional study conduct 22 community harm reduction site offer dcs british columbia bc march 2021 july 2024 variable selection method backwards stepwise selection elastic net regularization fit model explore relationship select socio demographic characteristic drug use pattern experience drug check main outcome measure share drug checking result 516 participant include study 34 woman median age 42 274 53 report share drug checking result factor significantly positively associate share result multivariable logistic regression analysis selection method include drug dealing dcs stable employment white ethnicity participant report share drug checking result 66 report sharing result friend family 28 report sharing result drug dealer study reveal half study sample share drug check result result share positively associate recent drug dealing frequent dcs utilisation employment ethnicity drug checking result share friend family drug dealer finding extend evidence base dcs harm reduction tool demonstrate engagement dcs facilitate information dissemination drug market actor
40561651,Factors impacting military emergency medicine residents' sleep and barriers to seeking help: A sequential exploratory mixed-methods study.,"Emergency medicine (EM) resident physicians face unique challenges in adhering to the principles of sleep hygiene due to the nature of EM shift work. They are at higher risk for sleep disorders, sleep-related errors and accidents, and impaired performance due to constantly changing schedules. Military residents also perceive a stigma against seeking mental health care and taking sleeping medications. This mixed-methods study investigated sleep quality and barriers to seeking care among EM residents at a single center, three-year, Active-Duty military EM residency program. A survey was made available to all 36 EM residents assessing daytime sleepiness using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) with a target response rate of 66.7 %. The purpose of using the ESS was to identify at least 9 EM residents with excessive daytime sleepiness to participate in semi-structured interviews about their sleeping experiences. Excessive daytime sleepiness is defined as ≥11 on the ESS. These interviews were coded using a phenomenological approach to data analysis. Of the 36 EM residents in the program, 24 (66.7 %) completed the survey. Of these, 11 scored ≥11 on the ESS. Of these, nine EM residents participated in semi-structured interviews. Thematic saturation was achieved, and four themes emerged from interviews: 1) challenges with sleep hygiene; 2) less satisfied with sleep since starting residency; 3) normalization of poor sleep; and 4) taking medication for sleep is stigmatized. Results revealed significant difficulties adhering to the principles of sleep hygiene due to inconsistent sleep-wake times. Participants identified difficulty avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and large meals before bed, and felt their sleep had worsened since starting residency. Though residents often discussed sleep difficulties with colleagues, these conversations normalized sleeping problems and reduced help-seeking behavior. Participants perceived a stigma against using prescription medication for sleep. This study highlights significant sleep disturbances experienced by EM residents in this study and an inability to adhere to the principles of sleep hygiene. Normalization of sleep disturbances in residency seems to impede residents from seeking professional help. Further research should focus on targeted interventions to improve resident sleep hygiene, promote help-seeking behavior, and reduce the stigma associated with prescription drug use, when necessary. Additional studies are needed to examine the generalizability of these results to other training programs.",The American journal of emergency medicine,2025.0,Joshua J Oliver; David S Ediger; Jillian F Phelps; Ariel L Hoffman; Alexander W Martin; Sadie A Martin; Rachel E Bridwell; Simon D Aebersold; Rebekah Cole; Jeffrey C Ransom,emergency medicine em resident physician face unique challenge adhere principle sleep hygiene nature em shift work high risk sleep disorder sleep relate error accident impair performance constantly change schedule military resident perceive stigma seek mental health care take sleeping medication mixed method study investigate sleep quality barrier seek care em resident single center year active duty military em residency program survey available 36 em resident assess daytime sleepiness epworth sleepiness scale ess target response rate 66.7 purpose ess identify 9 em resident excessive daytime sleepiness participate semi structured interview sleeping experience excessive daytime sleepiness define ≥11 ess interview code phenomenological approach data analysis 36 em resident program 24 66.7 complete survey 11 score ≥11 ess em resident participate semi structured interview thematic saturation achieve theme emerge interview 1 challenge sleep hygiene 2 satisfied sleep start residency 3 normalization poor sleep 4 take medication sleep stigmatize result reveal significant difficulty adhere principle sleep hygiene inconsistent sleep wake time participant identify difficulty avoid caffeine alcohol large meal bed feel sleep worsen start residency resident discuss sleep difficulty colleague conversation normalize sleeping problem reduce help seek behavior participant perceive stigma prescription medication sleep study highlight significant sleep disturbance experience em resident study inability adhere principle sleep hygiene normalization sleep disturbance residency impede resident seek professional help research focus target intervention improve resident sleep hygiene promote help seek behavior reduce stigma associate prescription drug use necessary additional study need examine generalizability result training program

40561556,The impact of depression on functioning: Relation to medication response and other predictors.,"Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide, profoundly impairing occupational, social, and family functioning. We aimed to identify socio-demographic and clinical variables associated with functional impairment across these domains in patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD), with a particular focus on treatment-resistant depression (TRD). 755 patients with MDD and treated with antidepressants for at least four weeks were included from the multicentric study of ""Group for the Study of Resistant Depression"". Depression severity was assessed using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (retrospective and current), while functional impairment was measured with the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Univariate and multivariate models adjusted for age, sex, and depression severity were used. Across all domains, higher depression severity, particularly marked by suicide risk, anhedonia, and inpatient status, was strongly linked to higher disability. In non-TRD patients, somatic comorbidities, including diabetes, were significant predictors of social and family functioning impairment, whereas in TRD patients, family-related factors such as a higher number of children and living alone were associated with impaired functioning.

40561552,The Perspective of Psychiatry and Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Residents About Psychotherapy Training in Portugal.,"Psychotherapy is an effective treatment for various mental disorders. Most recommendations advocate training in psychotherapy for psychiatry and child and adolescent psychiatry residents. However, incorporating psychotherapy training into the curricula of psychiatric residency programs has proven difficult. In Portugal, competence in psychotherapy is not mandatory to become a psychiatrist or a child and adolescent psychiatrist. Our study aims to describe the perspectives of psychiatry and child and adolescent psychiatry residents on psychotherapy training in Portugal. The authors developed a voluntary, anonymous, online self-reported questionnaire to be applied to psychiatry and child and adolescent psychiatry residents. Data was collected during 2023. The response rate was 29.9%. The main results were that most Portuguese psychiatry and child and adolescent psychiatry trainees stated that their institution did not provide psychotherapy training (95.2%) and were dissatisfied with the psychotherapy training provided by their residency centers (96.8%). All residents agreed that psychotherapy training involves a significant financial investment, and almost all (96.8%) believed it involved a substantial investment in terms of time in the long term. Likewise, most trainees (94.4%) considered psychotherapy training should be included within the residency work schedule. Crucially, psychiatry and child and adolescent psychiatry residents were interested in psychotherapy training (93.6%), and most regarded psychotherapy as a mandatory competence of the residency training program (85.7%). More than two-thirds (70.6%) of residents considered initiating or continuing psychotherapy training after residency. Regarding the modalities that should be included in the residency program, residents pointed out cognitive-behavioral therapy, family therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and support psychotherapy. About 40% of respondents mentioned they were in personal psychotherapy during the residency. Modifications in residency curricula should seriously be considered so that future psychiatrists can be qualified to provide effective psychotherapy treatment. The authors believe they provided relevant data pooled from future psychiatrists and child and adolescent psychiatrists which can be useful to help define training in a perceived essential competence.",Acta medica portuguesa,2025.0,Rui M Salgado; Orlando Von Doellinger,psychotherapy effective treatment mental disorder recommendation advocate training psychotherapy psychiatry child adolescent psychiatry resident incorporate psychotherapy training curricula psychiatric residency program prove difficult portugal competence psychotherapy mandatory psychiatrist child adolescent psychiatrist study aim describe perspective psychiatry child adolescent psychiatry resident psychotherapy training portugal author develop voluntary anonymous online self report questionnaire apply psychiatry child adolescent psychiatry resident datum collect 2023 response rate 29.9 main result portuguese psychiatry child adolescent psychiatry trainee state institution provide psychotherapy training 95.2 dissatisfied psychotherapy training provide residency center 96.8 resident agree psychotherapy training involve significant financial investment 96.8 believe involve substantial investment term time long term likewise trainee 94.4 consider psychotherapy training include residency work schedule crucially psychiatry child adolescent psychiatry resident interested psychotherapy training 93.6 regarded psychotherapy mandatory competence residency training program 85.7 third 70.6 resident consider initiate continue psychotherapy training residency modality include residency program resident point cognitive behavioral therapy family therapy interpersonal psychotherapy psychodynamic psychotherapy support psychotherapy 40 respondent mention personal psychotherapy residency modification residency curriculum seriously consider future psychiatrist qualified provide effective psychotherapy treatment author believe provide relevant datum pool future psychiatrist child adolescent psychiatrist useful help define training perceive essential competence

The CaMKIIα hub domain was recently identified as a high-affinity binding site for γ-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), representing a new target for neurological research and therapy. In this study, we synthesized and evaluated two novel radiofluorinated GHB analogs, [<sup>18</sup>F]<b>6</b> and [<sup>18</sup>F]<b>9</b>, to visualize CaMKIIα via this domain in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET).

40561477,Exploring the neural mechanisms of ADHD in children: a multifeature cross-task fNIRS analysis.,"Children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder exhibit multidimensional abnormalities of brain function, and the identification of key brain regions is often inconsistent across studies due to the influence of specific cognitive demands and feature selection. We conducted multifeature cross-task analysis and correlation analysis of functional near-infrared spectroscopy-based functional activity and connectivity under both resting state and verbal fluency task. Results reveal that more pronounced brain activation differences were observed in the right hemisphere of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder group compared with healthy controls, particularly in channels 7 and 13, with cross-task consistent activation patterns. The strongest connectivity appeared between the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the right frontopolar cortex in both resting state and verbal fluency task. Meanwhile, the task-related significant differences were mainly found in the left hemisphere, with fewer connectivity differences between tasks than between groups. Furthermore, a complex nonlinear relationship was identified between brain activation intensity and functional connectivity in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, a negative correlation in resting state, and a positive correlation in half of the brain regions (including bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) during verbal fluency task. These findings support the existing attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder mechanisms and supplement the complexity of cross-task brain functional reorganization and fixed functional abnormalities, thereby advancing research on the neurobiological basis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.","Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",2025.0,Mengxiang Chu; Jiaojiao Ren; Lijuan Yang; Yunxiang Ma; Zhengyu Zhong; Xiaowei He; Hongbo Guo; Xiao Li; Jingjing Yu; Zhaohui Wang,child attention deficit hyperactivity disorder exhibit multidimensional abnormality brain function identification key brain region inconsistent study influence specific cognitive demand feature selection conduct multifeature cross task analysis correlation analysis functional near infrared spectroscopy base functional activity connectivity rest state verbal fluency task result reveal pronounce brain activation difference observe right hemisphere attention deficit hyperactivity disorder group compare healthy control particularly channel 7 13 cross task consistent activation pattern strong connectivity appear right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex right frontopolar cortex rest state verbal fluency task task relate significant difference mainly find left hemisphere few connectivity difference task group furthermore complex nonlinear relationship identify brain activation intensity functional connectivity attention deficit hyperactivity disorder negative correlation rest state positive correlation half brain region include bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex verbal fluency task finding support exist attention deficit hyperactivity disorder mechanism supplement complexity cross task brain functional reorganization fix functional abnormality advance research neurobiological basis attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
40561474,Foxg1 gene mutation impairs auditory cortex response and reduces sound tolerance.,"FOXG1 syndrome (FS) is a rare and devastating neurodevelopmental disorder affected by FOXG1 gene mutations and reduced sound tolerance has been reported in children with FS. Effects of single missense mutation of Foxg1 gene on auditory function and behavior were studied using the G216S mouse model. G216S mice showed significantly reduced gap-induced prepulse inhibition, suggesting poor temporal processing without hearing loss. Increased running and freezing behaviors under loud sounds were also found in G216 mice, suggesting aversive sound behaviors. Electrophysiological assessment of the auditory cortex of G216 mice revealed a slightly reduced amplitude and enlarged poststimulus responses to the sound stimulus. The layer function analysis using current source density revealed reduced layer-specific response in the G216S mice. Immunocytochemistry found Foxg1 gene mutation affects cortical layer differentiations and reduced cortical neurons, which are consistent with the physiological results. Our study suggests that the Foxg1 mutation impaired cortical development. The results are consistent with other models of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), suggesting that the G216S mouse model may represent a hyperacusis model of ASD. Our results provide direct evidence that a single-nucleotide mutation of the Foxg1 gene can affect cortical layer development and auditory processing and reduce sound tolerance.","Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",2025.0,Fei Xu; Guangdi Chen; Shin Jeon; Lynne Ling; Senthilvelan Manohar; Dalian Ding; Benjamin D Auerbach; Jae Lee; Soo-Kyung Lee; Wei Sun,foxg1 syndrome fs rare devastating neurodevelopmental disorder affect foxg1 gene mutation reduce sound tolerance report child fs effect single missense mutation foxg1 gene auditory function behavior study g216s mouse model g216s mouse show significantly reduce gap induce prepulse inhibition suggest poor temporal processing hear loss increase run freeze behavior loud sound find g216 mouse suggest aversive sound behavior electrophysiological assessment auditory cortex g216 mouse reveal slightly reduce amplitude enlarge poststimulus response sound stimulus layer function analysis current source density reveal reduce layer specific response g216s mouse immunocytochemistry find foxg1 gene mutation affect cortical layer differentiation reduce cortical neuron consistent physiological result study suggest foxg1 mutation impair cortical development result consistent model autism spectrum disorder asds suggest g216s mouse model represent hyperacusis model asd result provide direct evidence single nucleotide mutation foxg1 gene affect cortical layer development auditory processing reduce sound tolerance
40561473,Effectiveness of Information and Communication Technology-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Using the Smart Sleep App on Insomnia in Older Adults: Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Insomnia is a common sleep disorder, especially among older adults, with a significant impact on the quality of life (QoL) and is associated with various comorbidities. Traditional pharmacotherapy for insomnia is often unsuitable for older adults because of potential drug interactions and side effects, making nonpharmacological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) more appropriate. However, delivering CBT-I in a traditional face-to-face setting poses challenges including accessibility and adherence, particularly for older adults. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an information and communication technology (ICT)-based CBT-I program, ""Smart Sleep,"" specifically designed to improve insomnia among community-dwelling older persons. A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted with 59 older participants from Incheon, South Korea. Participants were divided into an intervention group, which used the Smart Sleep mobile app, and a control group. The intervention group received 8 weeks of non-face-to-face CBT-I through the app, which included sleep diaries, relaxation exercises, and real-time consultations. Outcomes were measured at baseline, week 4, and week 8, with a focus on insomnia severity, sleep quality, sleep efficiency, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, depression, and QoL. The intervention group showed significant improvements in insomnia severity, sleep quality, sleep efficiency, and dysfunctional beliefs about sleep compared to the control group. However, there was no significant difference in the QoL between the 2 groups (F<sub>2,114</sub>=0.998, P=.37). Participation rates in the Smart Sleep program were high, with a 94% completion rate for sleep diary tasks and 100% participation in real-time consultations. In addition, subgroup analysis based on sleep medication use showed significant improvements in insomnia severity for both medicated and nonmedicated participants. The ICT-based CBT-I program ""Smart Sleep"" effectively improved sleep-related outcomes among older participants, demonstrating the potential of non-face-to-face interventions in managing insomnia in this population. The program is user-friendly, and ICT-based coaching contributed to high engagement. To ensure broader access for older adults, distribution through community welfare or public health centers is recommended.

40561441,Novel Top Surgery in Small-Breasted Individuals with Gender Dysphoria: Periareolar Interlocking Suture and Waterjet-Assisted Liposuction.,"In small-breasted individuals with gender dysphoria (GD), the concentric periareolar approach is typically the preferred method for mastectomy. However, this method carries a notable risk of hypertrophic scars and changes in areolar dimensions. In this article, the authors introduce the periareolar interlocking suture (PIS) as a new scar-minimizing procedure with a low complication rate and high level of patient satisfaction. The corresponding author (A.W.) performed a concentric periareolar mastectomy combined with PIS and waterjet-assisted liposuction in patients with small breasts (A to B cup) and good skin quality and elasticity. Outcome measures included complication rates, patient satisfaction (based on the BODY-Q Chest and Nipples scales and scar appearance), nipple sensitivity, and rate of surgical corrections. Between April of 2017 and December of 2023, the corresponding author (A.W.) conducted 2312 mastectomies in 1156 individuals with GD, with 410 breasts treated using concentric periareolar mastectomy combined with PIS and waterjet-assisted liposuction. The mean patient age was 23 years; the mean hospital stay was 4 days; and the mean operative time was 96.1 minutes. The overall complication rate was 7.8%, with acute hematomas occurring in 4.6% of cases. Secondary revisions were necessary in 2.2% of cases. Patient satisfaction, measured using the BODY-Q scale, was statistically significant and very high. Individuals with GD are well informed and increasingly demand aesthetically pleasing outcomes. Whenever feasible, procedures with minimal scarring are preferred. The technique presented here resulted in a high level of patient satisfaction, preserved nipple sensitivity, and a low rate of complications and secondary aesthetic corrections in a carefully selected cohort of patients with small breasts.

40561419,Serum Autoantibody Titers and Neurofilament Light Chain Levels in CASPR2/LGI1 Encephalitis: A Longitudinal Study.,"Autoantibodies against contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2-IgG) and leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 protein (LGI1-IgG) identify a subgroup of autoimmune encephalitis (AE). Up to 65% of patients with LGI1/CASPR2 AE show cognitive sequelae that are unpredictable at onset. We aimed to assess the clinical relevance of serum autoantibody titers and neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels as biomarkers in CASPR2/LGI1 AE. We selected consecutive CASPR2/LGI1-IgG-positive patients with at least 2 longitudinal serum samples obtained more than 60 days apart. Samples were defined as acute (first diagnostic evaluation after onset or relapse and before immunotherapy) and remission (>2 months from attack). CASPR2/LGI1-IgG was titered with a live cell-based assay. Functional outcome was measured using modified Rankin Scale and Clinical Assessment Scale in AE and cognitive impairment using Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). We included 23 patients (LGI1 = 15, CASPR2 = 7, CASPR2/LGI1 = 1) with 130 serum samples (acute = 32; remission = 98). Serum titers in the acute phase were higher than in remission and decreased over time and after immunosuppressive treatment. In 9 of 10 patients, relapses occurred with seropositive samples, and in 4 of 5 patients, these occurred with increased titers. Onset titers did not correlate with functional/cognitive outcome at follow-up.Serum NfL median levels in both patients with LGI1 AE (35.3 pg/mL, range: 5.4-164) and CASPR2 AE (31.4 pg/mL, range: 9.11-120) were higher than in age/sex-matched controls (14.55, range: 5.4-56.8, <i>p</i> = 0.004 and <i>p</i> < 0.001, respectively). Acute-phase samples had higher NfL median levels (47.2, range: 9.11-120) compared with remission (31.2 pg/mL; range, 5.4-114, <i>p</i> = 0.02). NfL levels at onset predicted lower MoCA scores at follow-up in univariate linear regression analysis (B = -3.881, <i>p</i> = 0.0256). NfL levels decreased over time, but at the last follow-up remained higher than those in controls (<i>p</i> = 0.02).

40561381,Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Associations of Neighborhood Disadvantage With Fluid Biomarkers of Neuroinflammation and Neurodegeneration.,"Living in a socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhood has an adverse impact on health outcomes, including increased risk of Alzheimer disease (AD). The biological mechanisms underlying this risk are poorly understood. We sought to examine how neighborhood disadvantage relates to core AD pathology, neurodegeneration, and inflammatory biomarkers in community-dwelling older adults cross-sectionally and over time. Participants included older adults from the Vanderbilt Memory and Aging Project who underwent fasting blood and CSF acquisition serially over a 9-year follow-up period (mean follow-up = 6.4 years [blood] and 4.0 years [CSF]). Area Deprivation Index (ADI), representing neighborhood disadvantage, was quantified at baseline using 17 components (e.g., housing, income, education, and household characteristics), with higher values indicating greater disadvantage. Ordinary least-squares regressions cross-sectionally related ADI to plasma and CSF inflammatory biomarkers adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, modified Framingham Stroke Risk Profile score, <i>APOE</i> ε4 status, and cognitive status. Linear mixed-effects regression models related ADI to longitudinal biomarkers with identical covariates plus follow-up time. Outcomes included CSF chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), CSF soluble-triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2, CSF amyloid-β<sub>42</sub> (Aβ<sub>42</sub>), CSF Aβ<sub>40</sub>/Aβ<sub>42</sub> ratio, CSF tau, CSF phosphorylated tau (ptau), plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), and plasma and CSF neurofilament light chain. Participants (n = 334; 73 ± 8 years old, 59% male, 86% White, non-Hispanic) on average were from relatively less disadvantaged neighborhoods (ADI national decile = 33 ± 25, range = 1-98). Greater neighborhood disadvantage at study entry was cross-sectionally associated with elevated CSF YKL-40 (β = 0.7, <i>p</i> = 0.003) and tau (β = 1.8, <i>p</i> = 0.04) after excluding outliers.

40561371,Neuropathic Pain and Distinct CASPR2 Autoantibody IgG Subclasses Drive Neuronal Hyperexcitability.,"Patients with autoantibodies (aAbs) against the contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2) suffer from a variety of clinical syndromes including neuropathic pain. CASPR2 is an adhesion protein of the neurexin family and part of the voltage-gated potassium channel complex (VGKC complex) in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. The pathologic mechanisms following the binding of CASPR2 aAbs and their association with pain are only partially understood. CASPR2 aAbs are mainly of the IgG4 subclass; however, previous studies have neglected subclass-dependent effects. We investigated 49 subclassified patient serum samples positive for CASPR2 aAbs combining superresolution lattice structural illumination microscopy (SIM<sup>2</sup>) and functional readouts by calcium imaging and electrophysiologic recordings on cultured DRG neurons. CASPR2-positive patient sera subclassified in IgG4 together with at least 1 other IgG subclass (IgGX) and patients with only IgG4 were further subdivided into the pain and no pain groups. A decrease of CASPR2 expression along the axons after exposure to CASPR2 aAbs was observed for all patient groups except the group without pain and IgG4. Moreover, binding of CASPR2 aAbs from patients with pain increased the distance between CASPR2 and associated potassium channels along DRG axons determined by SIM<sup>2</sup> microscopy. CASPR2 aAbs of patients with pain significantly increased overall neuronal excitability of cultured DRG neurons as measured by calcium imaging. Patch-clamp recordings revealed significantly decreased current amplitudes of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels after incubation with all 4 CASPR2 aAb subclassifications with the most prominent effect of serum samples harboring IgG4 aAbs only. Replacement of patient aAbs by healthy control serum rescued Kv channel function to normal levels suggesting that the affected potassium channel function is due to structural blockage and disrupted interactions within the VGKC complex. The last might also be rescued on novel protein synthesis and membrane trafficking of CASPR2. IgG4 aAbs seem to be the major modifier of potassium channel function. The DRG hyperexcitability is primarily due to impaired Kv channel conductance as a consequence of CASPR2 aAb binding. However, additional unidentified signal pathways contribute to this process in patients with neuropathic pain.",Neurology(R) neuroimmunology & neuroinflammation,2025.0,Margarita Habib; Anna-Lena Wiessler; Patrik Fischer; Michele Niesner; Mareike Selcho; Ligia Abrante; Christian Werner; Annemarie Sodmann; Maximilian Koch; Abdolhossein Zare; Harald Prüss; Justina Dargvainiene; Jan Lewerenz; Robert Handreka; Peter Körtvelyessy; Dirk Reinhold; Franziska S Thaler; Kalliopi Pitarokoili; Robert J Kittel; Michael Briese; Michael Sendtner; Heike Rittner; Frank Leypoldt; Claudia Sommer; Robert Blum; Kathrin Doppler; Carmen Villmann,patient autoantibody aabs contactin associate protein like 2 caspr2 suffer variety clinical syndrome include neuropathic pain caspr2 adhesion protein neurexin family voltage gate potassium channel complex vgkc complex dorsal root ganglia drg neuron pathologic mechanism follow binding caspr2 aabs association pain partially understand caspr2 aabs mainly igg4 subclass previous study neglect subclass dependent effect investigate 49 subclassifie patient serum sample positive caspr2 aabs combine superresolution lattice structural illumination microscopy sim < sup>2</sup > functional readout calcium imaging electrophysiologic recording cultured drg neuron caspr2 positive patient sera subclassifie igg4 1 igg subclass iggx patient igg4 subdivide pain pain group decrease caspr2 expression axon exposure caspr2 aabs observe patient group group pain igg4 bind caspr2 aabs patient pain increase distance caspr2 associate potassium channel drg axon determine sim < sup>2</sup > microscopy caspr2 aabs patient pain significantly increase overall neuronal excitability cultured drg neuron measure calcium imaging patch clamp recording reveal significantly decrease current amplitude voltage gate potassium kv channel incubation 4 caspr2 aab subclassification prominent effect serum sample harbor igg4 aabs replacement patient aabs healthy control serum rescue kv channel function normal level suggest affect potassium channel function structural blockage disrupt interaction vgkc complex rescue novel protein synthesis membrane trafficking caspr2 igg4 aabs major modifier potassium channel function drg hyperexcitability primarily impaired kv channel conductance consequence caspr2 aab bind additional unidentified signal pathway contribute process patient neuropathic pain

This retrospective study aimed to develop a combined logistic regression and QUEST decision tree model to predict early myocardial dysfunction in OSA patients. Echocardiography left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) and right ventricular free wall longitudinal strain (RVFWLS) were used to assess myocardial function in OSA patients. Predictive models were constructed using clinical parameters. External validation involved 100 OSA patients from a respiratory sleep clinic. LVGLS and RVFWLS were significantly impaired in OSA patients, particularly in moderate-to-severe cases. BMI, percentage of sleep time with oxygen saturation <90% (CT90%), and arterial bicarbonate were identified as key predictors. The combined model achieved superior predictive accuracy, with an area under the curve of 0.91 for LVGLS and RVFWLS reductions, outperforming individual models. External validation confirmed the stability and generalizability of the model.

40561212,"Economic Burden of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Panic Anxiety, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).","Considering the importance of depression and anxiety disorders in the new century and one of the important causes of disability and lost years worldwide and imposing a huge cost on the global economy, economic burden studies to determine the location of costs and the consumption of medical resources in recent years have contributed a lot to health policymaking. During the studies, it was found that the prevalence of these disorders increased significantly in Iran. This reason, along with the difference in the results of studies on the economic burden of depression and anxiety published in Iran in recent years, was one of the reasons for conducting a study of the economic burden related to these disorders in the East Azarbaijan province of Iran.  A retrospective, non-interventional, cross-sectional, social perspective study was conducted using a bottom-up approach for direct costs and a human capital approach for indirect costs. The data was collected from outpatients over the first four months of 2022 and from inpatients over the first nine months of the same year. Patients without age limits and suffering from at least one major depressive disorder (F32.0-F33.9), panic anxiety (F41.0), and generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1) and natives of East Azerbaijan province were included in the study. In the study for direct costs, the cost of measures that are paid directly in the process of diagnosis and treatment (medical and non-medical) were examined separately for outpatients and inpatients. For indirect costs, lost productivity due to absenteeism and premature death was calculated. For outpatients, a researcher's fee checklist form was made, and for the data of inpatients, the financial statement available in the medical file of the hospital's accounting system was used. Razi Tabriz and Imam Khomeini Benab hospitals and mental health centers of Tabriz were used as public centers, and specialist psychiatrists' offices of Tabriz were used as private centers. Patients with more than one comorbidity were excluded from the study. Total costs are reported at purchasing power parity rates.  The data of 145 outpatients and 198 inpatients were analyzed to calculate the economic burden of MDD, Panic Anxiety, and GAD. The total economic burden for these disorders was obtained by 142.2 million purchasing power parity (ppp) dollars in 2022 for the East Azarbaijan province of Iran, with a population of more than 3.5 million people. The economic burden was divided into direct costs of 35.4 million dollars ppp and indirect costs of 106.79 million dollars ppp, representing 24.9% and 75.1%, respectively. The share of direct expenses of the outpatient group is 23.1% of this percentage, and the remaining 1.8% is for the inpatient group. In the case of indirect cost, from the percentage related to this sector, the share of lost productivity due to lost working days is 65.84%, and 9.26% is lost productivity due to premature death. For the outpatient group, the cost of medicine with 58.64% of the cost per person, and in the inpatient group, the cost of patient hoteling with 55.63%, and the visit of a psychiatrist with 20.34% of the direct cost per hospitalized person, the largest share of the direct costs of these people they assigned themselves. According to the method adopted in the study, the total cost showed the highest sensitivity to the GDP Per Capita (ppp) and the prevalence rate of anxiety and the prevalence rate of depression, respectively.   Based on the results of the study, it is clear that indirect costs account for a significant share of the economic burden. Also, although the direct costs per inpatient are higher than the direct costs per outpatient, due to the difference in the number of outpatients and inpatients, the direct costs of the outpatient group have a larger share of the total cost of the disease. Considering the average age of patients and the large age gap to retirement age, health policymakers should take necessary measures to deal with and prevent the ever-increasing costs.",The journal of mental health policy and economics,2025.0,Ali Abdollahi Najand Asl; Ali Imani; Mostafa Farahbakhsh; Parvin Sarbakhsh,consider importance depression anxiety disorder new century important cause disability lose year worldwide impose huge cost global economy economic burden study determine location cost consumption medical resource recent year contribute lot health policymaking study find prevalence disorder increase significantly iran reason difference result study economic burden depression anxiety publish iran recent year reason conduct study economic burden relate disorder east azarbaijan province iran retrospective non interventional cross sectional social perspective study conduct approach direct cost human capital approach indirect cost datum collect outpatient month 2022 inpatient month year patient age limit suffering major depressive disorder f32.0 f33.9 panic anxiety f41.0 generalize anxiety disorder f41.1 native east azerbaijan province include study study direct cost cost measure pay directly process diagnosis treatment medical non medical examine separately outpatient inpatient indirect cost lose productivity absenteeism premature death calculate outpatient researcher fee checklist form datum inpatient financial statement available medical file hospital accounting system razi tabriz imam khomeini benab hospital mental health center tabriz public center specialist psychiatrist office tabriz private center patient comorbidity exclude study total cost report purchase power parity rate datum 145 outpatient 198 inpatient analyze calculate economic burden mdd panic anxiety gad total economic burden disorder obtain 142.2 million purchasing power parity ppp dollar 2022 east azarbaijan province iran population 3.5 million people economic burden divide direct cost 35.4 million dollar ppp indirect cost 106.79 million dollar ppp represent 24.9 75.1 respectively share direct expense outpatient group 23.1 percentage remain 1.8 inpatient group case indirect cost percentage relate sector share lose productivity lose working day 65.84 9.26 lose productivity premature death outpatient group cost medicine 58.64 cost person inpatient group cost patient hoteling 55.63 visit psychiatrist 20.34 direct cost hospitalize person large share direct cost people assign accord method adopt study total cost show high sensitivity gdp capita ppp prevalence rate anxiety prevalence rate depression respectively base result study clear indirect cost account significant share economic burden direct cost inpatient high direct cost outpatient difference number outpatient inpatient direct cost outpatient group large share total cost disease consider average age patient large age gap retirement age health policymaker necessary measure deal prevent increase cost
40561176,Construction of a Prognostic Model Using RNA Processing Factor Genes and the Key Role of NSUN6 in Glioma Outcomes.,"Glioma is the most common malignant brain tumor and remains associated with a poor prognosis and limited predictive tools. The dysregulation of RNA processing factor genes has been implicated in glioma development, yet their prognostic relevance remains unclear. This study aimed to construct a robust prognostic model based on RNA processing factor genes and explore their functional roles and therapeutic potential. Transcriptomic and clinical data from glioma patients in the TCGA, CGGA, GEO and Rembrandt cohorts were analysed. Univariate, multivariate and LASSO-Cox regression analyses were performed to establish a prognostic signature. Model performance was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, time-dependent ROC analysis and C-index evaluation. Key genes were identified via random forest analysis and validated through single-cell datasets and immunohistochemistry. Functional assays were conducted to examine the biological roles of the key gene. Seventy-eight RNA processing factor genes were associated with glioma prognosis, and a 19-gene risk signature was constructed. The model effectively stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups with significantly different survival outcomes (log-rank p < 0.001). The AUCs for 1-, 3- and 5-year survival were 0.812, 0.774 and 0.769 in TCGA and 0.796, 0.758 and 0.741 in CGGA.

40561143,Seeding amplification assay with Universal Control Fluid: Standardized detection of α-synucleinopathies.,"Seeding amplification assays, specifically the Real-Time Quaking-Induced Conversion method (RT-QuIC), have shown great diagnostic potential for α-synucleinopathies. Numerous research groups have demonstrated the method's high sensitivity and specificity using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and various RT-QuIC workflows. However, establishing a uniform and stably performing RT-QuIC protocol remains challenging. To address this, we established an RT-QuIC protocol with a Universal Control Fluid (UCF), which is simple to adopt, performs stably, and allows uniform preparation of both sample and control reactions. Firstly, we adapted and established a published 48-hour RT-QuIC protocol, including the in-house production of recombinant α-synuclein (rec α-syn), and evaluated its sensitivity and specificity through a blinded screening of an 81 CSF sample cohort consisting of Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Alzheimer's disease, motor neuron disease, multiple system atrophy, unidentified neurodegenerative diseases, and healthy controls. Additionally, we tested all CSF samples in three volumes to determine which volume provides the best diagnostic accuracy. The established RT-QuIC performs nearly equally well with 7 µL and 15 µL added CSF, resulting in 94% and 94.5% diagnostic accuracy, respectively. Secondly, we developed a UCF solution and tested its performance with the established RT-QuIC protocol. Results indicate that UCF, used in defined volume and concentration, standardizes the preparation of both sample and control reactions without compromising the assay's diagnostic accuracy and provides a stabilizing environment for the reactions, ensuring higher reproducibility. The established RT-QuIC protocol for pathologic α-synuclein detection in PD and DLB CSF samples is highly sensitive (92-96%) and specific (93-96%). Therefore, it is important that its adoption in clinical laboratories is uncomplicated and uniform. RT-QuIC with UCF simplifies, standardizes, and stabilizes the assay's performance and, thus, could be recommended as a standard protocol for accurate detection of α-synucleinopathies.",PloS one,2025.0,Remarh Bsoul; Anja H Simonsen; Kristian S Frederiksen; Kirsten Svenstrup; Sara Bech; Lisette Salvesen; Anne-Mette Hejl; Marcello Rossi; Piero Parchi; Eva L Lund; Aušrinė Areškevičiūtė,seed amplification assay specifically real time quaking induced conversion method rt quic show great diagnostic potential α synucleinopathie numerous research group demonstrate method high sensitivity specificity cerebrospinal fluid csf sample rt quic workflow establish uniform stably perform rt quic protocol remain challenge address establish rt quic protocol universal control fluid ucf simple adopt perform stably allow uniform preparation sample control reaction firstly adapt establish publish 48 hour rt quic protocol include house production recombinant α synuclein rec α syn evaluate sensitivity specificity blinded screening 81 csf sample cohort consist parkinson disease pd dementia lewy body dlb alzheimer disease motor neuron disease multiple system atrophy unidentified neurodegenerative disease healthy control additionally test csf sample volume determine volume provide good diagnostic accuracy established rt quic perform nearly equally 7 µl 15 µl add csf result 94 94.5 diagnostic accuracy respectively secondly develop ucf solution test performance established rt quic protocol result indicate ucf define volume concentration standardize preparation sample control reaction compromise assay diagnostic accuracy provide stabilize environment reaction ensure high reproducibility established rt quic protocol pathologic α synuclein detection pd dlb csf sample highly sensitive 92 96 specific 93 96 important adoption clinical laboratory uncomplicated uniform rt quic ucf simplifie standardize stabilize assay performance recommend standard protocol accurate detection α synucleinopathie
40561124,Associations between dietary microbe intake and mortality risk in individuals with sleep disorders: Evidence from NHANES.,"To investigate the association between dietary microbial intake, sleep patterns, and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality among U.S. adults. This study is conducted using data from the 2005-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Kaplan-Meier curves are used to preliminarily explore the relationship between dietary microbial intake, sleep disorders, and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in the population. The Cox proportional hazards model is applied for both individual and combined analyses to examine the relationship between dietary microbial intake, sleep disorders, and mortality risk, with subgroup and sensitivity analyses performed to assess model stability. This study included 21,233 participants, among whom 2,814 all-cause deaths and 877 cardiovascular deaths were documented. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a significant association between low dietary microbial intake or sleep disorders and elevated mortality. Cox proportional hazards modeling showed that, among individuals with sleep disorders, those with moderate dietary microbe intake had a lower mortality hazard ratio compared to those with low intake. Conversely, the combination of low dietary microbe intake and sleep disorders was associated with the highest all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

40561108,"Mental health disorders among children with special health needs: A population-based cohort study using linked administrative data from Manitoba, Canada.","An estimated 15-22% of Canadian kindergarten-age children have a special health need (SHN), defined as a clinical diagnosis, a functional need requiring special accommodation at school, or a health condition leading to increased needs. Children with SHN may be more likely to experience mental health disorders than their peers without SHN, placing them at risk for further health and academic challenges. Our objective was to determine the odds of children with SHN identified in kindergarten being diagnosed with a mental health disorder by age 16. In this retrospective cohort study using population-based, linked administrative data, we identified children with SHN born 1995-2020 in Manitoba, Canada, and enrolled in kindergarten from 2006-2011. The SHN designation is derived from the Early Development Instrument. We measured prevalence of common childhood mental health disorders (ADHD, mood/anxiety disorders, conduct disorders) in children with SHN to age 16. Using binary logistic regressions, we calculated crude odds ratios (OR) for children with vs. without SHN being diagnosed with a mental health disorder, then adjusted for age, sex, and neighbourhood-level income. Among 42,766 children, 13.8% had a SHN designation in kindergarten. Among these, 41.0% were diagnosed with a mental health disorder by age 16. The odds of a mental health diagnosis by SHN category were: special needs designation in kindergarten (OR 1.75, 95%CI 1.53-2.01); learning impairment (OR 1.61, 95%CI 1.39-1.86); behavioural impairment (OR 3.27, 95%CI 2.87-3.72); and emotional impairment (OR 2.01, 95%CI 1.75-2.32). Children with SHN (vs. none) had higher odds of a mental health disorder if they had 1 + impairment (OR 1.67, 95%CI 1.50-1.85).

Since cognitive decline typically precedes ADRD, it is crucial to identify interventions that may help slow cognitive decline and reduce ADRD risk. We used a quasi-experimental design, exploiting exogenous expansions of South Africa's Older Persons Grant for men, to estimate its impact on memory decline and ADRD risk in the rural Mpumalanga province of South Africa. We found that expanded pension eligibility was associated with slower memory decline for men who were eligible to receive the pension 5 years earlier [β = 0.027 SD, 95% CI = 0.023, 0.031], as well as for men who were eligible to receive the pension 1-4 years earlier [β = 0.009 SD, 95% CI = 0.004, 0.013].

While some cranial nerves allow for CSF efflux, the immune environment around CSF-interfacing cranial nerves during neuroinflammation is still poorly understood. Using a mouse model of multiple sclerosis [experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)] and CNS <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> infection (CNS-Mtb), we examined immune responses around olfactory nerve bundles near the cribriform plate, a key CSF efflux route. During neuroinflammation, we found increased perineural immune cells that had access to intracranial injected beads, dye, and bacteria. Additionally, we identified osseous channels connecting the environment surrounding olfactory nerves to bone marrow in the cribriform plate (cpBM). Notably, the cpBM undergoes myelopoiesis during EAE, has access to components of intracranial drainage, and is vulnerable to Mtb bacteria invasion during CNS-Mtb infection.

Using a longitudinal design, 412 students were assessed at three intervals (fall, mid-year, and year-end) to examine how these foundational literacy skills contribute to predicting WRF and identifying at-risk readers. Results from multiple regression analyses indicate that both LNF and LSF are significant predictors of end-of-year WRF across both fall and mid-year assessments, with mid-year measures demonstrating enhanced predictive accuracy. In contrast, PSF showed limited predictive value in comparison to LNF and LSF. Accuracy analyses revealed that mid-year assessments, particularly LNF and LSF, were more reliable in identifying at-risk students compared to fall assessments. Mid-year assessments correctly identified 64-73% of at-risk readers, emphasizing their value in early detection and intervention. These findings underline the importance of dynamic, multi-point assessments in improving educational practices and outcomes, particularly for students at risk of reading difficulties.

40560963,Analysis of retinal markers and incident amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: An optical coherence tomography-based cohort study.,"Biomarkers are widely recognized as crucial breakthroughs in tackling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Among them, retina markers may hold promise due to the close retina-brain connection and non-invasive, portable detection methods. Thus, using optical coherence tomography (OCT), we investigated the link between baseline cell-level retinal features and future ALS risk. Participants from the UK Biobank underwent OCT scans to assess retinal layers, macula, and optic disc parameters. Follow-up commenced two years after the baseline period (2006-2010), during which ALS cases were identified using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes from medical and assessment records. Cox proportional hazards models were applied to examine the relationship between retinal markers and incident ALS. Over a median follow-up of 14.11 years, 70 ALS cases occurred among 53,824 participants (incidence 10.58 per 100,000 person-years). Most participants were White (94.6%), 44.8% male, with a median age of 58 years. After adjusting for demographics and comorbidities affecting the retina, a standard deviation (SD) decrease of 15.19 µm in photoreceptor layer (PRL) thickness was associated with a 19% (95% confidence interval [7, 29]; p = 0.002) increased risk of ALS, while a SD increase of 26.11 µm in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) thickness corresponded to a 20% (95% CI [7, 34]; p = 0.002) higher risk. Sensitivity analyses excluding follow-ups of less than 4 and 6 years yielded consistent results. Subgroup analyses showed these findings were more pronounced in smokers. The main limitation of this study is its single time point observational design.

40560959,Computer-aided discovery of dual-target compounds for Alzheimer's from ayurvedic medicinal plants.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, driven by the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. It involves the dysfunction of key enzymes such as Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and β-secretase (BACE1), making them critical targets for therapeutic intervention. In this study we investigated an in-house library of 820 secondary metabolites obtained from Ayurvedic plants against AChE and BACE1 with the aim to discover novel leads for AD. Virtual screening resulted in 15 ligands, mostly belonging to the ursane-type or dammarene-type triterpene saponins of Centella asiatica, reestablishing the potency of this plant in drug discovery against AD. The binding affinities were further verified by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, including root mean square fluctuations (RMSF), root mean square deviation (RMSD), hydrogen bonding analysis, Coulomb interaction calculation, Lennard-Jones interactions, and the total interaction energy. Moreover, extensive Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Gibbs free energy landscape were performed. Our results demonstrated three compounds, namely (S)-eriodictyol 7-O-(6-β-O-trans-p-coumaroyl)-β-d-glucopyranoside, sitoindoside-X and 1,5-di-o-caffeoyl quinic acid as more effective in treating AD due to their comparable drug-like properties.

40560940,The influence of hydrogel stiffness on axonal regeneration after spinal cord injury.,"The core challenge in spinal cord injury(SCI) treatment is promoting axonal regeneration and forming new neural connections in damaged areas. However, mature CNS neurons have limited regenerative capacity, causing long-term dysfunction. Axonal regeneration involves elongating axons guided by growth cones, which sense and respond to external mechanical signals, integrating them into cytoskeleton reconstruction. After injury, growth cones experience altered mechanical forces due to changes in ECM stiffness. However, systematic studies on matrix stiffness's impact on axonal regeneration post-SCI remain insufficient. This study investigates the influence of hydrogel stiffness on axonal regeneration following SCI. Using gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels with varying stiffness levels, we cultured dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons in vitro and applied the hydrogels to a complete transection SCI mouse model. Results demonstrated that higher stiffness GelMA (15% w/v) significantly enhanced axonal extension and sensory functional recovery compared to lower stiffness (7.5% w/v). The study highlights the critical role of ECM stiffness in regulating axonal regeneration and suggests that optimizing hydrogel stiffness can promote neural regeneration and functional recovery after SCI. These findings provide valuable insights for developing therapeutic strategies in SCI treatment.",PloS one,2025.0,Haiyang Deng; Jiaqing Zhou; Cong Long; Ping Luo; Zhong Xiang; Hao Zeng,core challenge spinal cord injury(sci treatment promote axonal regeneration form new neural connection damage area mature cns neuron limit regenerative capacity cause long term dysfunction axonal regeneration involve elongate axon guide growth cone sense respond external mechanical signal integrate cytoskeleton reconstruction injury growth cone experience alter mechanical force change ecm stiffness systematic study matrix stiffness impact axonal regeneration post sci remain insufficient study investigate influence hydrogel stiffness axonal regeneration follow sci gelatin methacryloyl gelma hydrogel vary stiffness level culture dorsal root ganglia drg neuron vitro apply hydrogel complete transection sci mouse model result demonstrate high stiffness gelma 15 w v significantly enhance axonal extension sensory functional recovery compare low stiffness 7.5 w v study highlight critical role ecm stiffness regulate axonal regeneration suggest optimize hydrogel stiffness promote neural regeneration functional recovery sci finding provide valuable insight develop therapeutic strategy sci treatment
40560908,The opportunity to save a life: A qualitative study of a point-of-care overdose education and naloxone distribution intervention.,"Canada's opioid crisis continues to escalate. Naloxone can effectively reverse the effects of opioid overdose. We planned a randomized trial on the effectiveness of a point-of-care overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) intervention on participants' performance in a simulated opioid overdose scenario. In preparation for the trial, we conducted a feasibility study which included a qualitative process evaluation aimed at eliciting participants' perspectives of the study's OEND tool and procedures, and how their lived experiences of the opioid crisis intersected with their experiences of the study. Twenty-three participants were interviewed, including people with lived experiences of opioid use or overdose, and people living in neighbourhoods or working in services where they were likely to encounter overdose. Thematic analysis of interview transcripts was informed by stigma theory. Participants' accounts depicted challenges faced by people who take opioids in their everyday lives, deep losses experienced, negative attitudes encountered, and systemic barriers to care. Participation in the study itself was portrayed as meaningful. We explored participants' experiences through three key themes: (1) who were the participants - describing their experiences related to opioid overdose, opioid use and attendant stigma; (2) why did they participate - recounting their motivations to join the study; and (3) what they thought about study processes - reflecting on the OEND materials and study procedures. Accounts revealed a sense of agency as participants confronted the opioid crisis. Our results demonstrate that people experiencing opioid use and overdose and people who care about them are eager and willing to be approached about research at point of care; participants were eager to learn overdose prevention skills and to return for follow-up study sessions. They recounted a range of motivations for participating, the most important of which is the opportunity to actively intervene, save lives and raise awareness.

40560906,Evaluation of nerve function after Bell's palsy based on different facial nerve assessment scales HBGS/SFGS/MPS: A comparative study.,"Studies have shown that approximately 30% of patients with Bell's palsy may experience permanent disfigurement due to muscle weakness affecting facial expressions. The prognosis for Bell's palsy is often correlated with the degree of impairment in facial nerve function observed in the early stages of the condition. Selecting appropriate assessment tools is essential for the effective treatment and prognosis of patients with Bell's palsy. Examine and compare three scales used to measure Bell's palsy: the House-Brackmann Grading Scale (HBGS), the Sunnybrook Facial Grading System (SFGS), and the Modified Portmann Scale (MPS). A retrospective study involved 97 patients with Bell's palsy treated at the authors' institution from 2021 to 2022. The authors accessed these data for research purposes in February 2025. The patient cohort underwent HBGS, SFGS, and MPS to assess facial nerve function before and after treatment. We compared the results of these three evaluation methods. Additionally, we performed correlation analyses and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses of the post-treatment data to examine the relationships between HBGS and SFGS and between HBGS and MPS, using the internationally recognized and most widely utilized HBGS as the standard. The HBGS demonstrated moderate consistency with both the FSGS and MPS, revealing significant negative correlations (r = -0.876, P < 0.01; r = -0.860, P < 0.01). All three scales exhibited high reactivity and showed no ceiling/floor effect. The optimal cut-off values for the FSGS and MPS were determined to be ≤ 68 and ≤ 16 points, respectively, with AUC of 0.948 (95% CI: 0.910-0.984) and 0.931 (95% CI: 0.883-0.968). HBGS, SFGS, and MPS are all appropriate tools for assessing Bell's palsy. The severity of facial nerve palsy can be clinically classified using a transect score of 68 on the SFGS and 16 on the MPS.

40560886,Novel insights from comprehensive analysis: The role of cuproptosis and peripheral immune infiltration in Alzheimer's disease.,"Cuproptosis is increasingly recognized as an essential factor in the pathological process of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the specific role of cuproptosis-related genes in AD remains poorly understood. Our first step was to obtain gene expression data from the GEO database and identify differentially expressed cuproptosis-associated genes (DECAGs) in AD. GO, KEGG, and GSEA analyses were then conducted on these genes. Subsequently, we attempted to classify AD patients by unsupervised clustering. Then, four machine-learning models were used to screen hub-genes from the DECAGs. We also explored the immune features of these genes and predicted target drugs. Molecular docking analysis was then performed on the predicted drugs and their corresponding hub-gene related proteins. Candidate markers were then validated by single-cell analysis and intracellular communication was investigated in a GEO scRNA-seq dataset. Lastly, we examined the expression levels of the hub-genes in peripheral blood cells using real-time quantitative PCR. 19 DECAGs were found in AD and the key biological processes and molecular functions associated with AD were further determined. Two subtypes of peripheral blood cells showed significant alternations in AD: Cluster1 and Cluster2. Five hub-genes including FDX1, GLS, PDK1, MAP2K1, and SOD1 were then screened out from the machine-learning study. All of the five hub-genes were significantly correlated with various immunocytes. We discovered compounds targeting hub-gene related proteins and forecasted multiple strong hydrogen bonding interactions between the picked predicted drugs and the target proteins by molecular docking analysis. Subsequently, in the single-cell analysis of AD peripheral blood, all hub-genes except SOD1 were found to be up-regulated in B cells, NK cells, and CD4+ T cells, possibly acting on the MIF pathway. Finally, we discovered that the levels of PDK1 expression in AD patients were remarkably upregulated, while FDX1 and GLS were significantly decreased using qPCR. This study examined changes in intercellular communication between immune cells in the peripheral blood and identified five novel feature genes associated with cuproptosis in AD patients. These results facilitated a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of AD and suggested novel therapeutic targets.",PloS one,2025.0,Jing Wang; Zi-Wen Yu; Qi Liu; Jing-Xun Wu; Yi-Dan Zhang; Hui-Juan Wan; Min Bi; Nai-An Xiao; Kun-Mu Zheng; Bin Jiang,cuproptosis increasingly recognize essential factor pathological process alzheimer disease ad specific role cuproptosis relate gene ad remains poorly understand step obtain gene expression datum geo database identify differentially express cuproptosis associate gene decag ad kegg gsea analysis conduct gene subsequently attempt classify ad patient unsupervised clustering machine learn model screen hub gene decag explore immune feature gene predict target drug molecular dock analysis perform predict drug correspond hub gene relate protein candidate marker validate single cell analysis intracellular communication investigate geo scrna seq dataset lastly examine expression level hub gene peripheral blood cell real time quantitative pcr 19 decag find ad key biological process molecular function associate ad determine subtype peripheral blood cell show significant alternation ad cluster1 cluster2 hub gene include fdx1 gls pdk1 map2k1 sod1 screen machine learn study hub gene significantly correlate immunocyte discover compound target hub gene relate protein forecast multiple strong hydrogen bonding interaction pick predict drug target protein molecular docking analysis subsequently single cell analysis ad peripheral blood hub gene sod1 find regulate b cell nk cell cd4 + t cell possibly act mif pathway finally discover level pdk1 expression ad patient remarkably upregulate fdx1 gls significantly decrease qpcr study examine change intercellular communication immune cell peripheral blood identify novel feature gene associate cuproptosis ad patient result facilitate deep understanding molecular mechanism ad suggest novel therapeutic target
40560842,Comparative mRNA profile analysis from NAc of adolescent male mice after binge-like alcohol exposure eliciting deficits in context fear extinction learning.,"Stressor-related disorders frequently co-occur with alcohol use disorder (AUD). This necessitates an understanding of the physiological and genetic factors contributing to this relationship. Binge drinking is the most common method of alcohol consumption among adolescent males and significantly increases the risk of developing comorbid stressor-related disorders and AUD. In experiments modeling the effects of a single binge-like alcohol exposure in male adolescent mice, we observed a clear deficit in context extinction learning. This exposure led to a significant initial increase in subsequent voluntary drinking on day one, as measured by the every-other-day (EOD) two-bottle choice drinking assay, which normalized thereafter. For this study we performed an mRNASeq analysis of mice nucleus accumbens (NAc), a region intricately involved in regulating both aversive contextual fear responses and reward, after EOD to profile the differential expression of mRNAs within this region. We also used immunohistochemistry of coronal brain slices to characterize expression of proteins associated with stress-related disorders and molecular alcohol tolerance, such as FKBP5, GSK3ß, and ß-catenin, within the striatum, nucleus accumbens (NAc), hippocampus, and basolateral amygdala (BLA). Comparative mRNA profile analysis reveals significant long-term changes in gene expression induced by binge-like alcohol exposure, even 30 days after the initial exposure. Immunohistochemistry showed a full recovery of previously observed altered levels of target proteins prior to EOD.

40560839,"Behavioral and Metabolomics Analyses of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> with Chronobiotic Melatonin Treatment: Effects on Locomotor Activity, Circadian Integrity, and Metabolic Pathways.","Circadian rhythm and the sleep/wake cycle can influence metabolic regulation, eating habits, hormone release, and common chronic health conditions such as obesity, depression, diabetes, and sleep disorders. <i>Drosophila melanogaster,</i> the fruit fly, with its conserved molecular clocks and accessible assays, has been used as an ideal model system to study biological processes, for example, circadian rhythms, sleep, neurodevelopment, genetics, and behavior. Using an integrated approach combining high-throughput locomotor activity monitoring and untargeted metabolomics, we analyzed the behavioral and metabolic effects of a chronobiotic melatonin. The behavioral activity of fruit flies was recorded using an infrared-based monitoring device, followed by data analysis with open-source data packages ShinyR-DAM and VANESSA. We found that 1 mM and 4 mM melatonin doses significantly increased <i>Drosophila</i> locomotor activity. Melatonin at a high concentration (4 mM) exhibited a protective effect to reduce mortality in <i>Drosophila</i>. Despite these changes, melatonin preserved the flies' endogenous bimodal activity pattern, maintaining circadian alignment. Metabolomics analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry identified differentially abundant metabolites after melatonin administration compared with the vehicle treatment. We discovered 20 biologically relevant metabolites altered by melatonin, including key perturbations in arginine biosynthesis, alanine/aspartate/glutamate metabolism, and pyrimidine pathways. Notably, melatonin upregulated glutamine, a potential indicator of enhanced neurotransmitter synthesis and broadly modulated amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, suggesting dual roles in neuroprotection and energy homeostasis. This high-throughput omics study uncovers melatonin-induced behavioral and metabolic perturbations in <i>Drosophila</i> as a model organism, revealing how melatonin modulates locomotor activity and circadian integrity through specific alterations in metabolism.",Omics : a journal of integrative biology,2025.0,Apoorva Bhatnagar; Srishti Banerjee; Sandip Das; Saibal Saha; Greg Murray; Sandipan Ray,"circadian rhythm sleep wake cycle influence metabolic regulation eat habit hormone release common chronic health condition obesity depression diabetes sleep disorder < > drosophila melanogaster,</i > fruit fly conserve molecular clock accessible assay ideal model system study biological process example circadian rhythm sleep neurodevelopment genetic behavior integrated approach combine high throughput locomotor activity monitoring untargeted metabolomic analyze behavioral metabolic effect chronobiotic melatonin behavioral activity fruit fly record infrare base monitor device follow datum analysis open source datum package shinyr dam vanessa find 1 mm 4 mm melatonin dose significantly increase < > drosophila</i > locomotor activity melatonin high concentration 4 mm exhibit protective effect reduce mortality < > drosophila</i > despite change melatonin preserve fly endogenous bimodal activity pattern maintain circadian alignment metabolomic analysis high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry identify differentially abundant metabolite melatonin administration compare vehicle treatment discover 20 biologically relevant metabolite alter melatonin include key perturbation arginine biosynthesis alanine aspartate glutamate metabolism pyrimidine pathway notably melatonin upregulated glutamine potential indicator enhanced neurotransmitter synthesis broadly modulate amino acid nucleotide metabolism suggest dual role neuroprotection energy homeostasis high throughput omic study uncovers melatonin induce behavioral metabolic perturbation < > drosophila</i > model organism reveal melatonin modulate locomotor activity circadian integrity specific alteration metabolism"
40560805,Differentiating Between Methylphenidate Use and Misuse: Clinical Insights From University Students and Academic Staff in Türkiye.,"BACKGROUND Methylphenidate (MPH) is widely prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but non-medical use is increasing, particularly in academic settings, for cognitive enhancement. This study aims to distinguish individuals using MPH for ADHD treatment from those misusing it by analyzing clinical and behavioral characteristics. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective study was conducted at a university-affiliated psychiatric outpatient clinic in Türkiye. Data were collected from structured psychiatric evaluations by a single psychiatrist between January and December 2024. A total of 135 individuals who requested MPH were included. Misuse was defined as use without an ADHD diagnosis, exceeding the prescribed dose, or use through non-oral routes. Participants were categorized into 4 groups based on diagnosis and misuse patterns. Data on demographics, psychiatric history, MPH use, and follow-up attendance were analyzed using descriptive and comparative methods. RESULTS Of the 135 participants, 3% were ADHD-diagnosed misusers, 33.3% were ADHD-diagnosed non-misusers, 11.9% were non-ADHD misusers, and 51.8% were non-ADHD non-misusers. Non-ADHD misusers were older (mean age 25 vs 22 years, P<0.001), had later MPH initiation (23 vs 15 years, P<0.001), more often held a PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) or an equivalent higher degree (23.3% vs 2.0%, P<0.001), had lower follow-up attendance (32.6% vs 93.9%, P<0.001), and preferred short-acting MPH (73.3% vs 20.4%, P<0.001). ADHD-diagnosed individuals were more likely to have a family psychiatric history (69.4% vs 21.0%, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Misuse patterns differ significantly from medically indicated use.

40560747,Early Onset Memory Deficit of WMI Rats Compared to Their Nearly Isogenic WLIs Is Reversed by Enriched Environment in Females.,"The underlying mechanisms of early onset memory deficit remain poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that environmental enrichment (EE) can attenuate early-onset cognitive decline in a novel genetic model, the Wistar Kyoto More Immobile (WMI) inbred rat strain, which manifests the risk factors of enhanced stress reactivity and depression-like behavior compared to its nearly isogenic control, the Wistar Kyoto Less Immobile strain (WLI). Middle-aged (12 months) WMI females exhibited dramatically diminished fear and spatial memory in the contextual fear conditioning and Morris Water Maze paradigms, respectively, compared to young females of both strains and to middle-aged WLI females. Middle-aged WMI males showed a lesser, but significant, age-induced deficit. EE from 6 to 12 months of age completely reversed the memory deficits in middle-aged WMI females and reversed age-induced decreases in plasma levels of estradiol. RNA sequencing from female hippocampi revealed significant strain, age, and enrichment-induced differentially expressed genes. Among these, solute carrier family 35, member A4 (Slc35a4) and potassium inwardly rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 2 (Kcnj2) were confirmed to show hippocampal expression changes parallel to that of memory in the WMI. These genes have critical roles in the integrated stress response, cellular metabolism, and the effects of stress on neurovascular coupling, respectively. Pathway analyses revealed the involvement of oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction in the hippocampal processes of aging and EE-induced reversal. These findings underscore the critical involvement of molecular stress responses in early-onset memory decline and suggest potential therapeutic targets for age-related cognitive impairment.","Genes, brain, and behavior",2025.0,Michelle T Ji; Katherine J Przybyl; Aspen M Harter; Mariya Nemesh; Sophia T Jenz; Anna Yamazaki; Chris Kim; Megan K Mulligan; Hao Chen; Eva E Redei,underlie mechanism early onset memory deficit remain poorly understand test hypothesis environmental enrichment ee attenuate early onset cognitive decline novel genetic model wistar kyoto immobile wmi inbreed rat strain manifest risk factor enhanced stress reactivity depression like behavior compare nearly isogenic control wistar kyoto immobile strain wli middle aged 12 month wmi female exhibit dramatically diminish fear spatial memory contextual fear conditioning morris water maze paradigm respectively compare young female strain middle aged wli female middle aged wmi male show less significant age induce deficit ee 6 12 month age completely reverse memory deficit middle aged wmi female reverse age induce decrease plasma level estradiol rna sequence female hippocampi reveal significant strain age enrichment induce differentially express gene solute carrier family 35 member a4 slc35a4 potassium inwardly rectify channel subfamily j member 2 kcnj2 confirm hippocampal expression change parallel memory wmi gene critical role integrated stress response cellular metabolism effect stress neurovascular coupling respectively pathway analysis reveal involvement oxidative phosphorylation mitochondrial dysfunction hippocampal process aging ee induce reversal finding underscore critical involvement molecular stress response early onset memory decline suggest potential therapeutic target age relate cognitive impairment
40560656,Effects of Health Shocks on Adult Children's Labor Market Outcomes and Well-Being.,"Using Norwegian administrative register data, we assess the impact of unexpected health shocks hitting lone parents on offspring's labor market outcomes and well-being. We use first-time hip fractures or strokes as indicators of parental health shocks and estimate both the overall effects and the heterogeneous impacts by the survival time of the affected parent. We identify small, but significant, immediate responses in terms of an increase in physician-certified sickness absences and a higher risk of diagnosed mental disorders. The short-term effects are larger for offspring whose parents die shortly after the shock. Most of the effects fade out quickly, and the negative impacts on subsequent employment and earnings are small and only borderline statistically significant.

40560615,Fluid dynamics model of the cerebral ventricular system.,"Hydrocephalus, a neurological condition characterized by an excessive buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain, affects millions worldwide and leads to severe consequences. Current treatments, such as ventriculoperitoneal shunts, divert excess CSF from the brain but often face complications, mainly due to shunt obstructions caused by biological matter accumulation. While previous shunt designs aimed to improve fluid flow and reduce occlusion, they often lacked the precision needed for real-world applications due to simplified simulation models that did not fully capture the dynamics of the cerebral ventricular system. Here, we introduce BrainFlow, a computational model that integrates detailed anatomical and physiological features to simulate CSF dynamics in the presence of shunt implants. BrainFlow incorporates patient-specific medical imaging data, pulsatile flow to mimic cardiac cycles, adjustable parameters for various hydrocephalus conditions, and a biomolecule tracking feature to evaluate the long-term risk of shunt occlusion due to flow-mediated biomolecular transport. This model provides a more nuanced understanding of the factors contributing to shunt obstruction, offering insights into optimal shunt placement, design, and materials choice. Through validation against four-dimensional MRI flow data, BrainFlow demonstrates robust accuracy across multiple flow metrics.

40560586,Neurodevelopment Among Infants With Late-Onset Fetal Growth Restriction.,"Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, the delineation of neurodevelopmental sequela in late-onset FGR has been hampered by challenges in diagnosing late-onset FGR and the confounding influence of prematurity. To characterize neurodevelopmental outcomes in full-term infants exposed to late-onset FGR and to examine the association of FGR with fetal hemodynamics, perinatal brain development, and somatic growth. In this single-center cohort study, pregnant persons with fetuses small for gestational age were enrolled between April 1, 2010, and August 31, 2016, and followed up until the infant was 36 months of age. Follow-up was completed November 2019. Data analysis was performed from June to August 2024. Late-onset FGR diagnosed based on a composite scoring system. The primary outcomes were neurodevelopmental outcomes at 4, 8, and 12 months of age assessed by the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) and at 18 and 36 months of age assessed by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition. Secondary outcomes included fetal hemodynamics and perinatal brain development assessed by magnetic resonance imaging findings and serial somatic growth. Among 97 singleton pregnancies (mean [SD] maternal age, 33.5 [3.8] years; 50 [52%] male neonates), 41 neonates (42%) were exposed to late-onset FGR. At 12-month follow-up, motor development was significantly delayed among full-term infants exposed to late-onset FGR compared with neonates appropriate for gestational age (AIMS mean difference, -4.5; 95% CI, -8.6 to -0.3). At all other time points, neurodevelopmental outcomes were similar between the groups. In models adjusted for covariates, gestational age at birth was associated with 18-month cognitive outcomes (coefficient, 4.13 [95% CI, 0.54-7.72]), while the diagnosis of late-onset FGR was not. Preterm infants exposed to FGR exhibited higher fetal combined ventricular output, higher ratio of cerebral to pulmonary blood flow, and lower oxygen saturation compared with full-term infants exposed to FGR and infants with no FGR exposure. In general, neonatal brain maturation and somatic growth by 12 months of age were similar between full-term infants exposed to FGR and those with no exposure. However, head circumference was smaller from birth until the 36-month follow-up in infants exposed to FGR. In this cohort study, full-term infants exposed to late-onset FGR exhibited normal neurodevelopmental outcomes by 18 and 36 months of age, and longer gestation was associated with improved outcomes. These findings suggest that early delivery is unlikely to offer neurodevelopmental benefit, and any adverse impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes of late-onset FGR among full-term infants is likely to be modest.",JAMA network open,2025.0,Liqun Sun; Fu-Tsuen Lee; Natasha Milligan; Mengyuan Zhu; Joshua F P van Amerom; Brahmdeep S Saini; Jessie Mei Lim; Christopher K Macgowan; Edmond Kelly; John C Kingdom; Mike Seed,fetal growth restriction fgr associate adverse neurodevelopmental outcome delineation neurodevelopmental sequela late onset fgr hamper challenge diagnose late onset fgr confound influence prematurity characterize neurodevelopmental outcome term infant expose late onset fgr examine association fgr fetal hemodynamic perinatal brain development somatic growth single center cohort study pregnant person fetus small gestational age enrol april 1 2010 august 31 2016 follow infant 36 month age follow complete november 2019 datum analysis perform june august 2024 late onset fgr diagnose base composite scoring system primary outcome neurodevelopmental outcome 4 8 12 month age assess alberta infant motor scale aims 18 36 month age assess bayley scales infant toddler development edition secondary outcome include fetal hemodynamic perinatal brain development assess magnetic resonance imaging finding serial somatic growth 97 singleton pregnancy mean sd maternal age 33.5 3.8 year 50 52 male neonates 41 neonate 42 expose late onset fgr 12 month follow motor development significantly delay term infant expose late onset fgr compare neonate appropriate gestational age aims mean difference -4.5 95 ci -8.6 -0.3 time point neurodevelopmental outcome similar group model adjust covariate gestational age birth associate 18 month cognitive outcome coefficient 4.13 95 ci 0.54 7.72 diagnosis late onset fgr preterm infant expose fgr exhibit high fetal combine ventricular output high ratio cerebral pulmonary blood flow low oxygen saturation compare term infant expose fgr infant fgr exposure general neonatal brain maturation somatic growth 12 month age similar term infant expose fgr exposure head circumference small birth 36 month follow infant expose fgr cohort study term infant expose late onset fgr exhibit normal neurodevelopmental outcome 18 36 month age long gestation associate improved outcome finding suggest early delivery unlikely offer neurodevelopmental benefit adverse impact neurodevelopmental outcome late onset fgr term infant likely modest
40560571,Serotonin neurons are necessary for tonic sodium intake inhibition.,"Sodium appetite is a motivated behavior that occurs in response to sodium deprivation. Various neurotransmitters, including serotonin, are thought to regulate sodium intake. In the present study, we used genetic deletion to test whether serotonergic neurons are necessary for regulating sodium appetite. First, we confirmed that <i>Pet1</i>-Cre; <i>Lmx1b</i><sup>flox/flox</sup> (<i>Lmx1b</i><sup>f/f/p</sup>) mice have nearly complete deletion of serotonergic neurons, with only sporadic cells remaining. Next, we measured baseline intake of water and 3% NaCl and found that <i>Lmx1b</i><sup>f/f/p</sup> mice consume more salt than Cre-negative littermate-control mice (<i>Lmx1b</i><sup>f/f</sup>). Finally, we tested the necessity of serotonergic neurons for thirst and sodium appetite inhibition. After 24-hour water deprivation, mice lacking serotonergic neurons exhibited an intact thirst response by increasing water intake just like Cre-negative littermates. After furosemide diuresis followed by 24-hour sodium deprivation mice lacking serotonergic neurons exhibited an intact sodium appetite response by increasing salt and water intake like Cre-negative littermates. Interestingly, the baseline, daily salt intake of <i>Lmx1b</i><sup>f/f/p</sup> mice increased between tests relative to their initial baseline. Together, these findings indicate that while serotonergic neurons are not the primary mechanism controlling sodium appetite, they act as a 'brake' limiting sodium consumption. This tonic inhibitory role may protect against excess sodium intake and suggests the possibility that serotonergic medications may influence dietary sodium consumption.","American journal of physiology.

40560555,"Polygenic Risk, Psychopathology, and Personalized Functional Brain Network Topography in Adolescence.","Functional brain networks are associated with both behavior and genetic factors. To uncover biological mechanisms of psychopathology, it is critical to define how the spatial organization of these networks relates to genetic risk during development. To determine the associations among transdiagnostic polygenic risk scores (PRSs), personalized functional brain networks (PFNs), and overall psychopathology (p-factor) during early adolescence. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study is an ongoing longitudinal cohort study of 21 collection sites across the US. This cross-sectional analysis includes ABCD baseline data collected between September 2016 and October 2018. The ABCD Study is a multisite community-based study. The sample is largely recruited through school systems. ABCD exclusion criteria included severe sensory, intellectual, medical, or neurological issues that interfere with protocol and scanner contraindications. Split-half subsets were used for cross-validation, matched on age, ethnicity, family structure, handedness, parental education, site, sex, and anesthesia exposure. Data were analyzed from January 2023 to July 2024. Polygenic risk scores of transdiagnostic genetic factors F1 (PRS-F1) and F2 (PRS-F2) derived from adults in Psychiatric Genomic Consortium and UK Biobanks datasets. PRS-F1 indexes liability for common psychiatric symptoms and disorders related to mood disturbance; PRS-F2 indexes liability for rarer forms of mental illness characterized by mania and psychosis.

Membrane fouling, often caused by protein adherence, reduces toxin clearance and may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Recent studies have focused on modifying membrane chemistry to improve biocompatibility and reduce fouling. Although advancements have been made in understanding the biochemical and inflammatory responses during HD, the underlying molecular mechanisms, especially those involving epigenetic regulation remain incompletely understood. This review explores recent progress in HD treatment, with a specific emphasis on inflammation, gene expression, and epigenetic alterations. We examine how pro-inflammatory cytokines activate transcription factors that regulate gene expression and how genetic variability within inflammatory genes adds complexity to these pathways. In parallel, we assess emerging biocompatible membrane technologies designed to reduce adverse interactions with blood components, thereby enhancing patient safety and treatment efficiency. In addition, we discuss how genetic and epigenetic changes such as DNA mutations, methylation patterns, and histone modifications may influence patient responses to HD and contribute to complications, including mental health disorders such as depression. These insights support the development of personalized HD strategies tailored to the molecular and genetic profiles of individual patients. By integrating current findings from genetics, epigenetics, and gene expression studies, this review provides a comprehensive perspective on HD-related inflammation and molecular dysregulation.

40560490,Ivermectin's neuroprotective effects decrease with prolonged use after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.,"Ivermectin (IVM), the recipient of the 2015 Nobel Prize, is an FDA-approved drug for a variety of parasitic diseases in animals and humans. However, the implications of this compound on neurological disorders remain inadequately elucidated. Recently, our research team has elucidated the neuroprotective properties of ivermectin administered in three doses following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (IR). The objective of the current investigation is to ascertain whether ivermectin sustains its neuroprotective properties through prolonged administration in models of cerebral IR in rats, as well as to evaluate its impact on the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). A rat model of transient global cerebral IR was induced by occluding both carotid arteries for 20 min. Ivermectin (2 mg/kg/day) was administered intraperitoneally one hour after the induction of cerebral ischemia for 7 consecutive days at 24-hour intervals. Then, the effects of ivermectin on brain infarct size, blood cell profile, bleeding time, memory and learning, balance and motor coordination, myeloperoxidase enzyme activity, and H3cit protein levels were investigated. The finding showed that the administration of ivermectin for 7 days did not improve memory and learning, blood parameters, or cerebral infarct size. However, it caused a 25.4% reduction in citrullinated histone protein level, decreased myeloperoxidase activity (P = 0.017), and improved balance and motor coordination (P = 0.017 and P = 0.024).

40560479,The Pathogenesis of Papilledema: Review of the Literature and a New Hypothesis.,"Since the first description of swelling of the optic nerve head in patients with increased intracranial pressure, our understanding of its pathogenesis has undergone significant changes. Early theories postulated that the swelling was caused by excessive extracellular fluid, but these views were disproved when electron microscopy showed that the swelling arose from dilated optic nerve axons, and autoradiography demonstrated blocked axonal transport at the posterior lamina cribrosa. This led to the currently prevailing view that the axonal swelling is caused by the damming back of axoplasm. However, this theory cannot account for the extent of swelling, its rate of development, and the variety of morphological changes in papilledema. It also cannot explain the differing patterns of swelling in papilledema and acute glaucoma despite identically located blockages of axonal transport. We conducted a biomechanical analysis, in which we calculated the stresses induced in a cylindrical nerve by external compression and the effect of these stresses on the nerve's axons and the axoplasm within them. We propose a new theory in which the axial gradient of tissue pressure causes displacement of axoplasm from the extraocular to the intraocular segment of the nerve, accounting for the intraocular axonal swelling. In addition, a sharply localized axial shear stress disrupts the axonal cytoskeleton to block axonal transport. Although the pressure gradient and the shear stress are both caused by the external compression of the nerve, they differ in their relative magnitudes across the nerve cross-section. The proposed hypothesis resolves the difficulties with the damming back hypothesis.",Bulletin of mathematical biology,2025.0,David N Levine; Ari I Rapalino,description swell optic nerve head patient increase intracranial pressure understanding pathogenesis undergo significant change early theory postulate swelling cause excessive extracellular fluid view disprove electron microscopy show swelling arise dilate optic nerve axon autoradiography demonstrated block axonal transport posterior lamina cribrosa lead currently prevailing view axonal swelling cause dam axoplasm theory account extent swelling rate development variety morphological change papilledema explain differ pattern swell papilledema acute glaucoma despite identically locate blockage axonal transport conduct biomechanical analysis calculate stress induce cylindrical nerve external compression effect stress nerve axon axoplasm propose new theory axial gradient tissue pressure cause displacement axoplasm extraocular intraocular segment nerve account intraocular axonal swelling addition sharply localize axial shear stress disrupt axonal cytoskeleton block axonal transport pressure gradient shear stress cause external compression nerve differ relative magnitude nerve cross section propose hypothesis resolve difficulty dam hypothesis
40560468,Regional free-water diffusion is more strongly related to neuroinflammation than neurodegeneration.,"Recent research has suggested that neuroinflammation may be important in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Free-water diffusion (FWD) has been proposed as a non-invasive neuroimaging-based biomarker for neuroinflammation. Free-water maps were generated using diffusion MRI data in 367 patients from the Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative (108 Alzheimer's Disease/Mild Cognitive Impairment, 42 Frontotemporal Dementia, 37 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, 123 Parkinson's Disease, and 58 vascular disease-related Cognitive Impairment). The ability of FWD to predict neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration from biofluids was estimated using plasma glial fibrillary-associated protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NfL), respectively. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) performed the strongest out of all feature selection algorithms used and revealed regional specificity for areas that are the most important features for predicting GFAP over NfL concentration. Deep learning models using selected features and demographic information revealed better prediction of GFAP over NfL. Based on feature selection and deep learning methods, FWD was found to be more strongly related to GFAP concentration (measure of astrogliosis) over NfL (measure of neuro-axonal damage), across neurodegenerative disease groups, in terms of predictive performance. Non-invasive markers of neurodegeneration such as MRI structural imaging that can reveal neurodegeneration already exist, while non-invasive markers of neuroinflammation are not available.

Therefore, an International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system was developed to create a standardized approach for pretreatment risk stratification. This system considers several factors, including the patient's age, tumor histology, the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Staging System (INRGSS), DNA ploidy, the presence or absence of MYCN gene amplification in tumor cells, and segmental chromosomal aberrations, particularly the 11q aberration.

40560423,Epilepsy Prediction via Time-Frequency Features and Multi-Scale Hybrid Neural Networks.,"The prediction of epileptic seizures heavily depends on the precise embedding and classification of complex, multi-dimensional electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Due to individual variability and the dynamic non-linear nature of EEG signals, extracting highly discriminative spatiotemporal features is a core challenge in this field. In this study, to address this issue, we proposed a novel architecture based on the Epilepsy Prediction using Multi-Scale Hybrid Neural Network (EPM-HNN), which integrates adaptive channel weighting, multi-scale spatial feature extraction, and bidirectional temporal dependency modeling. Specifically, we incorporated a sliding window mechanism with spatiotemporal resolution into the feature extraction process, enhancing the model's sensitivity to neural dynamics across frequency bands and improving its ability to capture micro-patterns. We used the Res2Net-50 multi-scale feature extractor to enhance the convolutional neural network's capacity to process complex local micro-features, such as polyspike-and-slow-wave complexes. Additionally, we introduced Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet) to adaptively capture potential effective features between different EEG channels. This dynamic weighting mechanism based on adaptive attention demonstrates strong robustness and high generalization across individual subject data. Furthermore, we proposed a non-single-subject, non-specific cross-subject training and testing method, demonstrating its ability to combat overfitting when addressing differences in data distribution. Experiments on the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset achieved an overall prediction accuracy of 97.7%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed EPM-HNN architecture.",Journal of medical systems,2025.0,Wenwen Chang; Bingyang Ji; Dandan Li; Lei Zhen; Yaxuan Wei; Xuan Liu; Guanghui Yan,prediction epileptic seizure heavily depend precise embedding classification complex multi dimensional electroencephalogram eeg signal individual variability dynamic non linear nature eeg signal extract highly discriminative spatiotemporal feature core challenge field study address issue propose novel architecture base epilepsy prediction multi scale hybrid neural network epm hnn integrate adaptive channel weighting multi scale spatial feature extraction bidirectional temporal dependency modeling specifically incorporate slide window mechanism spatiotemporal resolution feature extraction process enhance model sensitivity neural dynamic frequency band improve ability capture micro pattern res2net-50 multi scale feature extractor enhance convolutional neural network capacity process complex local micro feature polyspike slow wave complex additionally introduce squeeze excitation networks senet adaptively capture potential effective feature different eeg channel dynamic weighting mechanism base adaptive attention demonstrate strong robustness high generalization individual subject datum furthermore propose non single subject non specific cross subject training testing method demonstrate ability combat overfitte address difference datum distribution experiment chb mit scalp eeg dataset achieve overall prediction accuracy 97.7 validate effectiveness propose epm hnn architecture

Against this background this article outlines a youth mental health paradigm which prioritizes the early detection, early intervention and prevention of mental disorders, e.g., psychoses, bipolar disorders and personality disorders in adolescence. The first part of the article summarizes the findings for sensitive phases during brain development, which indicate the elevated plasticity of neural circuits during youth that can be used for preventive interventions. The interactions between risk and resilience factors and ongoing brain development are an essential reason for the frequent occurrence of mental disorders between 12-25 years. Furthermore, innovative diagnostic approaches, such as clinical staging models, are proposed that are a prerequisite for early detection and early intervention.

40560244,Phytochemicals as modulators of ferroptosis: a novel therapeutic avenue in cancer and neurodegeneration.,"Ferroptosis, a controlled cell death mechanism characterised by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, has become a significant factor in the pathophysiology of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Its dual role as a tumor suppressor and mediator of neuronal damage highlights its significance as a therapeutic target. Phytochemicals, natural bioactive molecules in plants, have attracted interest for their ability to modulate ferroptosis through diverse mechanisms, including regulation of oxidative stress, iron metabolism, and antioxidant defense systems. This review examines the complex relationship between ferroptosis and disease mechanisms, emphasizing its relevance in treatment-resistant cancers and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Information was taken from reputable databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. We thoroughly analyzed the current evidence on phytochemicals-including polyphenols like curcumin and epigallocatechin gallate, flavonoids like quercetin and luteolin, and alkaloids like berberine-as modulators of ferroptotic pathways. Despite their promising therapeutic potential, challenges such as limited bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and clinical validation remain significant hurdles. Future research focusing on advanced delivery systems, synergistic approaches, and personalized medicine strategies could unlock the full potential of phytochemicals in ferroptosis-targeted therapies.

40560091,Where Does It All Itch? Exploring the Characteristics of Pruritus in Small Fiber Neuropathy.,"Chronic itch, or pruritus, is a common discomfort of the skin. Chronic itch has been described as a symptom of small fiber neuropathy (SFN), a disorder affecting the small myelinated Aδ- and unmyelinated C-fibers. While prior studies report itch rates in SFN ranging from 63%-68%, a distinct pattern has not been identified. This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of itch in a large cohort of SFN patients. Between May 2016 and August 2022, 1415 patients filled out an exploratory questionnaire about characteristics of their itch symptoms. 83% were diagnosed with SFN based on the Besta criteria. Itch was reported in 66% of SFN patients, mainly experienced as tickling, prickling, and tingling sensations. Itch was most common in the evening, with 98% reporting continuous or episodic symptoms during this time. The itch was predominantly localized to the distal extremities, especially the lower legs and feet (over 50% of patients), with additional reports on the back (25%) and face (27%). Unlike the typical stocking-glove distribution seen with neuropathic pain, itch showed a slightly more proximal locus. SFN patients were more likely to report itching in the hands and feet than non-SFN patients. This study reveals that itch in SFN is a frequent, heterogeneous symptom that may differ from neuropathic pain in its distribution. Itch, particularly in the hands and feet, may provide diagnostic guidance and suggest SFN as a potential diagnosis.

40560089,Leveraging big electronic data to identify oral care disparities in individuals with serious mental illness.,"Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) have poorer oral health than the general population for various reasons, including poor oral hygiene, adverse effects of psychotropic medicines, stigma, fear, cognitive impairment, lack of insur¬ance coverage, and a shortage of professionals qualified to manage the oral health needs of this population. Oral health deteriorates further when care is postponed, resulting in greater treatment needs when the patient visits the dental office. This retrospective study aimed to determine differ¬ences in service return rate and frequency of visits for each of 12 American Dental Association (ADA) oral procedures in patients with and without SMI who were treated in a predoctoral dental clinic at a northeastern US dental school. This retrospective study used the dental electronic health records of 12,138 adult patients aged 18 years and over (total of 19,096 unique patient encounters) who received at least 1 comprehensive oral evaluation between January 1, 2017, and August 31, 2021. Three data processing methods were implemented to retrieve periodontal diagnoses in accordance with American Academy of Periodontology guidelines and to extract medical histories and behavioral factors from free text. Chi-square tests determined that there were statistically significant differences between the 2 groups for 4 of 12 ADA procedures, while t tests deter¬mined that the SMI group had a higher frequency of visits for 6 procedure categories. Logistic regression analysis showed that patients with an SMI had a significantly higher odds ratio of receiving 2 procedure categories (remov¬able prosthodontics and adjunctive general services). A negative binomial regression analysis was then conducted to predict the frequency of visits; patients with an SMI had a higher incidence rate ratio of receiving 4 ADA procedure categories (preventive, removable prosthodontics, oral and maxillofacial surgery, and adjunctive general services). This study identified the existence of oral healthcare disparities in a population with SMI in relation to specific ADA dental procedure categories.

40560063,Peripheral Neuropathy as an Early Marker in Newborn-Screened Krabbe Disease: The Value of Pre-Confirmatory Neurophysiological Testing.,"Krabbe disease, or globoid cell leukodystrophy, is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme galactosylceramidase (GALC). This deficiency leads to the toxic accumulation of psychosine, resulting in progressive demyelination and neuronal death. The clinical manifestations of Krabbe disease progress through different stages, starting with irritability, stiffness, and feeding difficulties, followed by myoclonic-like jerks in the upper and lower extremities, hypertonicity, and eventually severe hypotonia and lack of movement. This case report features two newborn screening patients with (NBS)-positive Krabbe disease who underwent electrodiagnostic (EDX) testing and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) soon after birth. The EDX results indicated severe sensory-motor polyneuropathy of mixed demyelinating and axonal types. Biochemical analyses confirmed significantly reduced GALC enzyme activity and elevated psychosine levels in both cases. Genetic testing identified pathogenic variants, including compound heterozygous deletions and mutations within the GALC gene. At 6-month follow-up post-HSCT, one patient showed age-appropriate milestones and improvement in motor amplitudes on repeat nerve conduction studies. EDX testing is helpful in assessing NBS-positive Krabbe disease before confirmatory testing results become available. In conjunction with genetic confirmation and GALC enzyme levels, EDX test results were useful to counsel families that their seemingly normal newborn has severe disease and facilitated discussion toward timely treatment with HSCT. We suggest that EDX be included in the initial and follow-up evaluation of patients with Krabbe disease undergoing HSCT.",Journal of the peripheral nervous system : JPNS,2025.0,Anthara Gnanakumar; Rana Aljaberi; Dawn A Laney; Christian Martin; Stephanie R Keller; Suhag H Parikh; Sumit Verma,krabbe disease globoid cell leukodystrophy rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterize deficient activity lysosomal enzyme galactosylceramidase galc deficiency lead toxic accumulation psychosine result progressive demyelination neuronal death clinical manifestation krabbe disease progress different stage start irritability stiffness feed difficulty follow myoclonic like jerk upper low extremity hypertonicity eventually severe hypotonia lack movement case report feature newborn screening patient nbs)-positive krabbe disease undergo electrodiagnostic edx testing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation hsct soon birth edx result indicate severe sensory motor polyneuropathy mixed demyelinating axonal type biochemical analysis confirm significantly reduce galc enzyme activity elevated psychosine level case genetic testing identify pathogenic variant include compound heterozygous deletion mutation galc gene 6 month follow post hsct patient show age appropriate milestone improvement motor amplitude repeat nerve conduction study edx testing helpful assess nbs positive krabbe disease confirmatory testing result available conjunction genetic confirmation galc enzyme level edx test result useful counsel family seemingly normal newborn severe disease facilitated discussion timely treatment hsct suggest edx include initial follow evaluation patient krabbe disease undergo hsct
40560017,Longitudinal Overlap and Metabolite Analysis in Spectroscopic MRI-Guided Proton Beam Therapy in Pediatric High-Grade Glioma.,"Pediatric high-grade glioma (pHGG) is a highly aggressive cancer with unique biology distinct from adult high-grade glioma, limiting the effectiveness of standard treatment protocols derived from adult research. The purpose of this report is to present preliminary results from an ongoing pilot study integrating spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) to guide proton beam therapy and longitudinal imaging analysis in pediatric patients with high-grade glioma (pHGG). Thirteen pediatric patients under 21 years old with supratentorial WHO grade III-IV glioma underwent baseline and serial whole-brain spectroscopic MRI alongside standard structural MRIs. Radiation targets were defined using T1-weighted contrast enhanced, T2-FLAIR, and Cho/NAA ≥ 2X maps. Longitudinal analyses included voxel-level metabolic change maps and spatial overlap metrics comparing pre-proton therapy and post-. Six patients had sufficient longitudinal data; five received sMRI-guided PBT. Significant positive correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.89, <i>p</i> < 0.0001) was observed between T2-FLAIR and Cho/NAA ≥ 2X volumes. Voxel-level difference maps of Cho/NAA and Choline revealed dynamic metabolic changes across follow-up scans. Analyzing Cho/NAA and Cho changes over time allowed differentiation between true progression and pseudoprogression, which conventional MRI alone struggles to achieve. Longitudinal sMRI enhanced metabolic tracking in pHGG, detects early tumor changes, and refines RT targeting beyond structural imaging.

40560014,Applications of Advanced Imaging for Radiotherapy Planning and Response Assessment in the Central Nervous System.,"Radiotherapy for tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) could be improved by incorporating advanced imaging techniques into treatment planning and response assessment. The objective of this narrative review is to highlight the recent developments in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) for applications in CNS radiotherapy. Recent articles were selected for discussion, covering the following topics: advanced imaging on MRI-linear accelerators for early response assessment in glioma; PET for guiding treatment planning and response assessment in glioma; and contrast-enhanced imaging and metabolic imaging for differentiating tumor progression and radiation necrosis for brain metastasis treatment. Where necessary, searches of scholarly databases (e.g., Google Scholar, PubMed) were used to find papers for each topic. The topics were chosen based on the perception of promise in advancing specific applications of CNS radiotherapy and not covered in detail elsewhere. This review is not intended to be comprehensive. Advanced MRI sequences and PET could have a substantial impact on CNS radiotherapy. For gliomas, the tumor response to therapy could be assessed much earlier than using the conventional technique of measuring changes in tumor size. Using advanced imaging on combined imaging/therapy devices like MR-Linacs would enable response monitoring throughout radiotherapy. For brain metastases, radiation necrosis and tumor progression might be reliably differentiated with imaging techniques sensitive to perfusion or metabolism. However, the lack of level 1 evidence supporting specific uses for each imaging technique is an impediment to widespread use.

40560010,"Role of Amide Proton Transfer Weighted MRI in Predicting MGMTp Methylation Status, p53-Status, Ki-67 Index, IDH-Status, and ATRX Expression in WHO Grade 4 High Grade Glioma.","<b>Objectives:</b> To assess amide proton transfer weighted (APTw) MR imaging capabilities in differentiating high-grade glial tumors across alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked (ATRX) expression, tumor-suppressor protein p53 expression (p53), O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter (MGMTp) methylation, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status, and proliferation marker Ki-67 (Ki-67 index) as a preoperative diagnostic aid. <b>Material & Methods:</b> A total of 42 high-grade glioma WHO grade 4 (HGG) patients were evaluated prospectively (30 males and 12 females). All patients were examined using conventional MRI, including the following: T1w-MPRAGE pre- and post-contrast administration, conventional T2w and 3D FLAIR, and APTw imaging with a 3T MR scanner. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated for the APTw% mean, median, and max signal for the different molecular biomarkers. A logistic regression model was constructed for combined mean and median APTw% signals for p53 expression. <b>Results:</b> The whole-tumor max APTw% signal could significantly differentiate MGMTp from non-MGMTp HGG, <i>p</i> = 0.035. A cutoff of 4.28% max APTw% signal yielded AUC (area under the curve) = 0.702, with 70.6% sensitivity and 66.7% specificity. The mean/median APTw% signals differed significantly in p53 normal versus p53-overexpressed HGG s: 1.81%/1.83% vs. 1.15%/1.18%, <i>p</i> = 0.002/0.006, respectively. Cutoffs of 1.25%/1.33% for the mean/median APTw% signals yielded AUCs of 0.786/0.757, sensitivities of 76.9%/76.9%, and specificities of 50%/66.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.002/0.006, respectively. A logistic regression model with a combined mean and median APTw% signal for p53 status yielded an AUC = 0.788 and 76.9% sensitivity and 66.2% specificity. ATRX-, IDH- wild type (wt) vs. mutation (mut), and the level of Ki-67 did not differ significantly, but trends were found: IDH-wt and low Ki-67 showed higher mean/median/max APTw% signals vs. IDH-mut and high Ki-67, respectively. ATRX-wt vs. mutation showed higher mean and median APTw% signals but lower max APTw% signal. <b>Conclusions</b>: APTw imaging can potentially be a useful marker for the stratification of p53 expression and MGMT status in high-grade glioma in the preoperative setting and potentially aid surgical decision-making.","Tomography (Ann Arbor, Mich.)",2025.0,Faris Durmo; Jimmy Lätt; Anna Rydelius; Elisabet Englund; Tim Salomonsson; Patrick Liebig; Johan Bengzon; Peter C M van Zijl; Linda Knutsson; Pia C Sundgren,< b > objectives:</b > assess amide proton transfer weight aptw mr imaging capability differentiate high grade glial tumor alpha thalassemia mental retardation x link atrx expression tumor suppressor protein p53 expression p53 o6 methylguanine dna methyltransferase promoter mgmtp methylation isocitrate dehydrogenase idh status proliferation marker ki-67 ki-67 index preoperative diagnostic aid < b > material methods:</b > total 42 high grade glioma grade 4 hgg patient evaluate prospectively 30 male 12 female patient examine conventional mri include follow t1w mprage pre- post contrast administration conventional t2w 3d flair aptw image 3 t mr scanner receiver operate characteristic roc curve calculate aptw% mean median max signal different molecular biomarker logistic regression model construct combined mean median aptw% signal p53 expression < b > results:</b > tumor max aptw% signal significantly differentiate mgmtp non mgmtp hgg < > p</i > = 0.035 cutoff 4.28 max aptw% signal yield auc area curve = 0.702 70.6 sensitivity 66.7 specificity mean median aptw% signal differ significantly p53 normal versus p53 overexpresse hgg s 1.81%/1.83 vs. 1.15%/1.18 < > p</i > = 0.002/0.006 respectively cutoff 1.25%/1.33 mean median aptw% signal yield auc 0.786/0.757 sensitivity 76.9%/76.9 specificity 50%/66.2 < > p</i > = 0.002/0.006 respectively logistic regression model combine mean median aptw% signal p53 status yield auc = 0.788 76.9 sensitivity 66.2 specificity atrx- idh- wild type wt vs. mutation mut level ki-67 differ significantly trend find idh wt low ki-67 show high mean median max aptw% signal vs. idh mut high ki-67 respectively atrx wt vs. mutation show high mean median aptw% signal low max aptw% signal < b > conclusions</b > aptw imaging potentially useful marker stratification p53 expression mgmt status high grade glioma preoperative setting potentially aid surgical decision making
40560007,The Image Clarity Paradox: Higher CZT SPECT Contrast Does Not Always Translate to Diagnostic Accuracy for Alzheimer's Disease.,"<b>Background</b>: Recent advances in single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) technology, particularly cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) detectors, have improved spatial resolution and contrast in cerebral blood flow imaging. This study aimed to investigate whether these improvements translate to enhanced diagnostic accuracy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). <b>Methods</b>: We compared conventional SPECT (eCAM) with CZT SPECT in 29 patients (mean age 60.9 ± 17.6 years, 69% female) with suspected neurodegenerative diseases. <b>Results</b>: Gray matter/white matter contrast was significantly higher in CZT SPECT compared to eCAM (1.615 ± 0.096 vs. 1.458 ± 0.068, <i>p</i> < 0.001). However, diagnostic accuracy for AD did not improve with CZT SPECT. For the participating psychiatrist, sensitivity decreased from 0.750 (eCAM) to 0.625 (CZT), while for the radiologist, specificity dropped from 0.571 (eCAM) to 0.429 (CZT). Overall accuracy slightly decreased for both readers. <b>Conclusions</b>: These findings suggest that while CZT SPECT offers superior image quality, it may not immediately translate to improved diagnostic accuracy for AD. The study highlights the importance of specialized training for clinicians in interpreting higher-resolution CZT SPECT images to fully leverage their potential in neurodegenerative disease diagnosis. Future research should focus on developing standardized training protocols and larger, multi-center studies to validate these findings.","Tomography (Ann Arbor, Mich.)",2025.0,Kiyotaka Nemoto; Bryan J Mathis; Akemi Iwasaka; Kenjiro Nakayama; Tomohiro Kaneta; Tetsuaki Arai,< b > background</b > recent advance single photon emission compute tomography spect technology particularly cadmium zinc telluride czt detector improve spatial resolution contrast cerebral blood flow imaging study aim investigate improvement translate enhance diagnostic accuracy alzheimer disease ad < b > methods</b > compare conventional spect ecam czt spect 29 patient mean age 60.9 ± 17.6 year 69 female suspect neurodegenerative disease < b > results</b > gray matter white matter contrast significantly high czt spect compare ecam 1.615 ± 0.096 vs. 1.458 ± 0.068 < > p</i > < 0.001 diagnostic accuracy ad improve czt spect participate psychiatrist sensitivity decrease 0.750 ecam 0.625 czt radiologist specificity drop 0.571 ecam 0.429 czt overall accuracy slightly decrease reader < b > conclusions</b > finding suggest czt spect offer superior image quality immediately translate improve diagnostic accuracy ad study highlight importance specialized training clinician interpret high resolution czt spect image fully leverage potential neurodegenerative disease diagnosis future research focus develop standardized training protocol large multi center study validate finding
40559938,Hippocampal Proteomics Reveals the Novel Molecular Profiling of Postnatal Lead (Pb) Exposure on Autism-like Behaviors.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a multifactorial neurodevelopmental disorder, with lead (Pb) exposure increasingly linked to its risk. However, the molecular mechanisms linking Pb to ASD remain poorly understood. This study established a postnatal Pb-exposed mouse model and employed the three-chamber social test and the marble-burying test to assess ASD-like behavioral phenotypes. The Pb levels in both blood and the hippocampus were quantified, and hippocampal neurons were assessed for morphological alterations. Moreover, a Tandem Mass Tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics approach was applied to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Neurobehavioral experiments revealed Pb-exposed C57BL/6 offspring exhibited reduced social interaction and novelty preference along with increased repetitive marble-burying behavior. The Pb levels in both the blood and hippocampus of Pb-treated mice were significantly elevated compared with those of control animals. Postnatal Pb exposure resulted in a reduction in the neuronal numbers and disorganized neuronal arrangement in the hippocampus. A total of 66 proteins were identified as being differentially expressed after postnatal Pb exposure. Among them, 34 differentially expressed proteins were common in both Pb exposure groups, with 33 downregulated and 1 upregulated. Bioinformatic analysis revealed multi-pathway regulation involved in Pb-induced neurodevelopmental disorders, including dysregulation of synaptic signaling, abnormal activation of neuron apoptosis, and neuroinflammation. Notably, the SYT10/IGF-1 signaling pathway may play a potential key role. These findings enhance understanding of Pb-induced autism-like behaviors, providing novel proteomic insights into the etiology of ASD.",Toxics,2025.0,Li Liu; Xulan Zhou; Zihan Ma; Ruming Liu; Yuhan Zhang; Yaqi Wang; Yiwen Liu; Xiaochun Xia; Juan Wang,autism spectrum disorder asd multifactorial neurodevelopmental disorder lead pb exposure increasingly link risk molecular mechanism link pb asd remain poorly understand study establish postnatal pb exposed mouse model employ chamber social test marble bury test assess asd like behavioral phenotype pb level blood hippocampus quantify hippocampal neuron assess morphological alteration tandem mass tag tmt)-base quantitative proteomic approach apply elucidate underlie mechanism neurobehavioral experiment reveal pb expose c57bl/6 offspring exhibit reduce social interaction novelty preference increase repetitive marble bury behavior pb level blood hippocampus pb treat mouse significantly elevate compare control animal postnatal pb exposure result reduction neuronal number disorganize neuronal arrangement hippocampus total 66 protein identify differentially express postnatal pb exposure 34 differentially express protein common pb exposure group 33 downregulate 1 upregulated bioinformatic analysis reveal multi pathway regulation involve pb induced neurodevelopmental disorder include dysregulation synaptic signaling abnormal activation neuron apoptosis neuroinflammation notably syt10 igf-1 signal pathway play potential key role finding enhance understanding pb induced autism like behavior provide novel proteomic insight etiology asd
40559877,Dual-Toxin-Producing <i>Clostridium botulinum</i> Strain Isolated from a Foodborne Botulism Case in Korea: Genomic and Functional Insights.,"<i>Clostridium botulinum</i> produces one of the most potent biological toxins and causes botulism, a rare but potentially fatal neuroparalytic disease. In 2014, a foodborne botulism case was reported in Korea, and a strain (CB-2014001) was isolated. Initial characterization identified it as a BoNT/B-producing strain based on mouse bioassay and conventional PCR. However, subsequent genomic analysis revealed the presence of dual BoNT gene clusters, bont/B and bont/F, corresponding to subtypes B5 and F2, respectively. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the genetic characteristics and toxin expression profiles of the isolated strain. The strain showed high sequence identity with Bf-type strains such as CDC 3281 and An436. Functional assays confirmed simultaneous expression of both BoNT/B and /F toxins at 35 °C, and temperature-dependent assays revealed predominant expression of BoNT/F at 30 °C and BoNT/B at 37 °C, indicating that toxin expression is influenced by environmental temperature. These findings highlight the potential for differential pathogenicity based on culture conditions and underscore the importance of developing diagnostic tools capable of detecting multiple <i>bont</i> genes.

While aesthetic changes are considered a side effect, their effect on patient satisfaction has not been thoroughly assessed. This study evaluated patient satisfaction with facial aesthetic outcomes after repeated OnaBoNT-A treatment for chronic migraine. Conducted at specialist headache centers, it included adult patients with chronic migraine who had received at least three OnaBoNT-A cycles. Participants completed a structured questionnaire on demographics, migraine history, facial wrinkles and age perception, appearance satisfaction, psychological impact, treatment satisfaction, and adverse aesthetic events. A total of 124 patients (92.7% female; median age 42.5 years) participated. OnaBoNT-A reduced wrinkle severity (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Most patients (74.2%) reported aesthetic improvement post-treatment. The majority of patients (76.7%) declared that treatment met or exceeded expectations. 32% reported looking younger post-treatment, with a median perceived age difference of 5 years.

40559867,Clinical Efficacy of Bladder Neck Injection of Botulinum Toxin A in Treating Neurogenic and Non-Neurogenic Voiding Dysfunctions Due to Bladder Neck Dysfunction.,"Bladder neck dysfunction (BND) is a pathophysiology associated with voiding dysfunction in patients with neurogenic or non-neurogenic voiding dysfunction. Botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) injection is a minimally invasive alternative for treating bladder outlet dysfunction; however, its efficacy for BND has not been well established. In this retrospective study, 41 patients with videourodynamic study-confirmed BND who failed medical therapy received a transurethral bladder neck injection of 100-U BoNT-A. Treatment outcomes were assessed using the Global Response Assessment. After BoNT-A injection, the patients were followed up and subsequent urological management was recorded. At 6 months, 65.9% of the patients reported satisfactory outcomes (26.8% successful and 39.0% improved). Patients with non-neurogenic BND had the highest satisfaction rate, higher than those with neurogenic BND (NBND) with and without detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (DSD). Among patients without detrusor acontractility (DA), a higher bladder outlet obstruction index predicted treatment failure. Patients with pure BND confirmed by urodynamics may benefit more from BoNT-A injections, whereas those with high baseline voiding detrusor pressure or spinal cord injury with detrusor sphincter dyssynergia may have less favorable results. Bladder neck BoNT-A injections for treating BND-associated voiding dysfunction did not achieve very successful outcomes.

40559842,Unveiling the Neurotoxic Effects of Ochratoxin A and Its Impact on Neuroinflammation.,"Ochratoxin A (OTA), a toxic compound generated by <i>Aspergillus</i> and <i>Penicillium</i> fungi, is a common contaminant in different food and animal feed sources, thereby posing possible dangers to human well-being. Although OTA is widely recognized for its kidney-damaging properties, new findings have also indicated its potential to harm the nervous system. Current research trends have increasingly examined the part played by environmental poisons, such as mycotoxins, in the development of diseases. This systematic review gathers and assesses the features of OTA along with the insights acquired from studies on its neurotoxicity. This work presents recent research that demonstrates some mechanisms by which OTA crosses the intestinal and blood-brain barriers, penetrating neural structures. In addition, it discusses the effect of OTA on several types of neural cells and its roles in apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and neurogenesis defects, while also determining the effects of antioxidant systems that neutralize the effects of OTA.

40559778,Faecal Microbiota Transplantation as an Adjuvant Treatment for Extraintestinal Disorders: Translating Insights from Human Medicine to Veterinary Practice.,"Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has emerged as a transformative therapy in human medicine, particularly for managing recurrent <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infections and other gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. Beyond the GI tract, FMT has shown potential in addressing extraintestinal conditions in people, including metabolic, immune-mediated, dermatological, neurological, and infectious diseases. Research in people has highlighted its efficacy in decolonising multidrug-resistant organisms in infection, mitigating autoimmune diseases, and improving outcomes in metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes. Furthermore, FMT has also been linked to enhanced responses to immunotherapy in cancer and improved management of hepatic and renal conditions. These findings underscore the intricate connections between the gut microbiome and systemic health, opening novel therapeutic avenues. In veterinary medicine, while FMT has demonstrated benefits for GI disorders, its application in extraintestinal diseases remains largely unexplored. Emerging evidence suggests that conditions such as atopic dermatitis, chronic kidney disease, immune-mediated diseases, and behavioural disorders in companion animals could benefit from microbiome-targeted therapies.

40559706,"Inflammatory, White Matter, and Neurodegenerative Mechanisms in Fluid Ability Decrements in Chronic Mild-to-Moderate Traumatic Brain Injury.","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects millions globally each year, with mild TBI comprising about 75% of cases. While most mild TBI symptoms are resolved within 3 months, some patients experience persistent issues. This study aimed to identify underlying mechanisms contributing to decrements in fluid cognitive abilities in chronic (>6 months) mild-to-moderate TBI. Specifically, the study focused on the relationships between cognitive performance, white matter integrity, TBI-related symptoms, and blood biomarkers, which are thought to be indicative of biological processes including neuronal injury (neurofilament light [NF-L], neurofilament heavy, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1), vascular injury (vascular endothelial growth factor A), glial injury (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), neurodegeneration (tau, phosphorylated-tau), immune response (GFAP immunoglobulin G), and inflammation (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin [IL]-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, interferon-γ, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α). The final study sample included 57 participants (42 males, 15 females) aged 19-59 with a history of chronic, remote mild-to-moderate TBI. Participants underwent cognitive and behavioral testing, neuroimaging, and a blood draw. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess white matter integrity in tracts connecting frontal and parietal regions with fractional anisotropy utilized as the metric. Blood samples were analyzed for TBI-related biomarkers. The study found that higher fluid cognition scores were associated with higher white matter integrity in frontal-parietal networks, fewer reported TBI-related symptoms, and mixed biomarker and cytokine levels. Inflammatory processes were linked to lower fractional anisotropy in white matter pathways, more reported symptoms, and increased biomarkers of injury. Higher white matter integrity was also associated with fewer reported neurobehavioral symptoms. The findings provide evidence for a complex interplay of ongoing neuroinflammatory processes, white matter integrity, symptomology, and cognitive function in chronic mild-to-moderate TBI. The results underscore the importance of considering both structural brain changes and systemic responses in understanding the long-term effects of TBI. The observed correlations between cognitive deficits, white matter disruptions, and biomarker profiles suggest potential avenues for targeted interventions aimed at mitigating these effects in TBI patients.",Journal of neurotrauma,2025.0,Samantha H Penhale; Abigail B Waters; Shoumi Sarkar; Leah E McQuillan; John Maczuzak; Somnath Datta; Damon Lamb; Claudia Robertson; Richard Rubenstein; Amy K Wagner; Firas Kobeissy; Kevin K W Wang; John B Williamson,traumatic brain injury tbi affect million globally year mild tbi comprise 75 case mild tbi symptom resolve 3 month patient experience persistent issue study aim identify underlie mechanism contribute decrement fluid cognitive ability chronic > 6 month mild moderate tbi specifically study focus relationship cognitive performance white matter integrity tbi relate symptom blood biomarker think indicative biological process include neuronal injury neurofilament light nf l neurofilament heavy ubiquitin c terminal hydrolase l1 vascular injury vascular endothelial growth factor glial injury glial fibrillary acidic protein gfap neurodegeneration tau phosphorylate tau immune response gfap immunoglobulin g inflammation tumor necrosis factor α interleukin il]-2 il-4 il-6 il-8 il-10 interferon γ macrophage inflammatory protein-1α final study sample include 57 participant 42 male 15 female age 19 59 history chronic remote mild moderate tbi participant undergo cognitive behavioral testing neuroimaging blood draw diffusion weight magnetic resonance imaging assess white matter integrity tract connect frontal parietal region fractional anisotropy utilize metric blood sample analyze tbi relate biomarker study find high fluid cognition score associate high white matter integrity frontal parietal network few report tbi relate symptom mixed biomarker cytokine level inflammatory process link low fractional anisotropy white matter pathway reported symptom increase biomarker injury high white matter integrity associate few report neurobehavioral symptom finding provide evidence complex interplay ongoing neuroinflammatory process white matter integrity symptomology cognitive function chronic mild moderate tbi result underscore importance consider structural brain change systemic response understand long term effect tbi observed correlation cognitive deficit white matter disruption biomarker profile suggest potential avenue target intervention aim mitigate effect tbi patient

We examined whether RS improves hyperglycemia-induced cognitive decline in a hyperglycemic mouse model pretreated with nicotinamide and streptozotocin and then orally administered a high-fat diet and maltodextrin (MD) for 4 months. RS was administered in an MD solution at doses of 75, 225, and 750 mg/kg of mouse body weight. Administration of RS to hyperglycemic mice significantly reduced blood glucose levels and tended to improve memory function in behavioral pharmacological tests using spontaneous locomotor activity, rotarod test, and eight-way-maze test, although the results were not significant. Brain histopathological analysis showed that RS significantly reduced atrophy of neuronal layers in each region of the hippocampus compared with untreated hyperglycemic controls. RS also significantly suppressed TNF-α expression and microglial activation in the brain.

40559632,Marine-Derived Antioxidants: A Comprehensive Review of Their Therapeutic Potential in Oxidative Stress-Associated Diseases.,"Oxidative stress is a critical factor contributing to the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, and neurodegenerative conditions. In recent years, marine-derived antioxidants have emerged as promising therapeutic agents due to their unique biological activities and diverse sources. This comprehensive review explores the therapeutic potential of various marine antioxidants in mitigating oxidative stress-associated diseases. Marine organisms are rich in bioactive compounds, such as polysaccharides, polyphenols, carotenoids, peptides, and vitamins, which exhibit potent antioxidant and free radical scavenging abilities. These compounds have been shown to effectively inhibit oxidative reactions, repair oxidative damage, and enhance the body's antioxidant defense mechanisms. For instance, marine polysaccharides and their derivatives can scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), protect neurons from oxidative damage, and alleviate inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Similarly, marine unsaturated fatty acids, such as omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), have been found to reduce cardiovascular risks by lowering serum triglyceride levels and improving vascular endothelial function. Additionally, marine-derived superoxide dismutase (SOD) plays a crucial role in neutralizing ROS, thereby offering protection against oxidative stress in various diseases. Despite these promising findings, challenges remain in the field, including the need for improved extraction and purification technologies, more comprehensive activity evaluation systems, and further research into the safety and bioavailability of these compounds. This review provides a detailed overview of the current research status, highlighting the types, structural characteristics, antioxidant activities, and mechanisms of action of marine antioxidants. It also identifies key areas for future research and development, aiming to harness the full potential of marine-derived antioxidants in the prevention and treatment of oxidative stress-related diseases.",Marine drugs,2025.0,Ruiqiu Zhang; Yuke Ren; Tianqi Ren; Yue Yu; Bo Li; Xiaobing Zhou,oxidative stress critical factor contribute pathogenesis numerous disease include cardiovascular disorder diabetes neurodegenerative condition recent year marine derive antioxidant emerge promise therapeutic agent unique biological activity diverse source comprehensive review explore therapeutic potential marine antioxidant mitigate oxidative stress associate disease marine organism rich bioactive compound polysaccharide polyphenol carotenoid peptide vitamin exhibit potent antioxidant free radical scavenging ability compound show effectively inhibit oxidative reaction repair oxidative damage enhance body antioxidant defense mechanism instance marine polysaccharide derivative scavenge reactive oxygen species ros protect neuron oxidative damage alleviate inflammation neurodegenerative disease like alzheimer parkinson disease similarly marine unsaturate fatty acid omega-3 polyunsaturate fatty acid pufa find reduce cardiovascular risk lower serum triglyceride level improve vascular endothelial function additionally marine derive superoxide dismutase sod play crucial role neutralize ros offer protection oxidative stress disease despite promising finding challenge remain field include need improved extraction purification technology comprehensive activity evaluation system research safety bioavailability compound review provide detailed overview current research status highlight type structural characteristic antioxidant activity mechanism action marine antioxidant identify key area future research development aim harness potential marine derive antioxidant prevention treatment oxidative stress relate disease

We aimed to describe the clinical features and neurological outcomes of PeV-A encephalitis cases identified in Warsaw. Infants with suspected encephalitis were retrospectively identified in three hospitals in the summer of 2022. Cases of confirmed PeV-A infection had their comprehensive demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, and outcome data reviewed. The psychomotor development of the children up to the age of 2 years was assessed by using the standardized tools. We identified 18 cases of confirmed encephalitis with a PeV-A infection. Their median age was 16 days. Fourteen cases were included in the analysis, while one patient dropped out after the first visit. Most were boys (9/14), and one patient was born preterm. Three patients had white matter alterations on brain MRI at discharge. No significant neurologic sequelae were observed after acute illness. At the 24-month follow-up, based on the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-IV) and the Brunet-Lézine Scale, the children showed no neurodevelopmental sequelae. Brain MRIs were obtained in all of the participants up to 12 months of age and revealed no significant lesions.

Changes in gut microbiota and persistent immune activation have been suggested as possible causes, while the role of probiotic supplementation remains controversial. We included subjects with mild HAND and successful ART. They were randomized to receive either 6 months of high-dose probiotic supplementation or to continue with only ART. Immune activation markers and neuropsychological testing were performed at baseline and the end of follow-up. Neuropsychological testing assessed learning, episodic memory, attention/concentration, executive functions, language, information processing speed, and motor skills. Z- and T-scores were calculated for all domains but motor skills, allowing the measurement of the global deficit score (GDS). The trajectories of neuropsychological performances and immune activation markers were compared between groups. From September 2020 to July 2021, 31 PWHs were included (median age 62, 73% men, CD4 744 cc/mm<sup>3</sup>), and 28 completed the 6-month follow-up. The characteristics of the subjects and their neuropsychological performance at baseline in the two groups were similar. At the end of follow-up, probiotics did not have any impact on immune activation markers, while they were associated with better improvement in GDS (T-score 0.0 in controls vs. -0.3 in probiotics, <i>p</i> = 0.048) and the attention/concentration test (Z-score 0.4 in controls vs. 1.2 in probiotics, <i>p</i> = 0.035). Oral supplementation with high-dose probiotics for 6 months did not affect systemic immune activation but was associated with improved neurocognitive performance, suggesting benefits from probiotic supplementation for mild HAND.","Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2025.0,Matteo Vassallo; Margaux Zerlini; Roxane Fabre; Heloise Joly; Jacques Durant; Alain Makinson; Amandine Mauries; Jacqueline Capeau; Soraya Fellahi; Jean-Philippe Bastard; Christian Pradier; Christine Lebrun-Frenay,prevalence hiv associate neurocognitive disorder hand remain high despite antiretroviral treatment art change gut microbiota persistent immune activation suggest possible cause role probiotic supplementation remain controversial include subject mild hand successful art randomize receive 6 month high dose probiotic supplementation continue art immune activation marker neuropsychological testing perform baseline end follow neuropsychological testing assess learning episodic memory attention concentration executive function language information processing speed motor skill z- t score calculate domain motor skill allow measurement global deficit score gds trajectory neuropsychological performance immune activation marker compare group september 2020 july 2021 31 pwh include median age 62 73 man cd4 744 cc mm < sup>3</sup > 28 complete 6 month follow characteristic subject neuropsychological performance baseline group similar end follow probiotic impact immune activation marker associate well improvement gds t score 0.0 control vs. -0.3 probiotic < > p</i > = 0.048 attention concentration test z score 0.4 control vs. 1.2 probiotic < > p</i > = 0.035 oral supplementation high dose probiotic 6 month affect systemic immune activation associate improved neurocognitive performance suggest benefit probiotic supplementation mild hand

This retrospective review includes patients aged 0-18 admitted to a tertiary hospital in Northern Italy between November 2023 and February 2025. Inclusion criteria were a positive influenza test, influenza-like symptoms, and neurological involvement. Findings are interpreted alongside current literature. Twenty-five unvaccinated children met criteria for IAE (11 in 2023/24; 14 in 2024/25). Neurological comorbidities were present in 40%. All patients had pathological EEGs. Lumbar puncture was performed in 40%, with abnormalities in 33%. Brain imaging was conducted in 56% of cases, revealing findings in 15%. All received oseltamivir; 60% were also treated with dexamethasone. Severe complications occurred in 16%, while 12% had persistent symptoms or required therapy at discharge. After adjusting for seasonal peak timing, no significant inter-seasonal difference was observed. Although IAE continues to present serious risks, recent trends suggest a changing burden. The lack of vaccination among cases underscores the need for prevention. Study limitations include its single-center design and the absence of long-term follow-up.

40559488,Psychoeducation for Relatives of Young Adults with First-Episode Psychosis: A Qualitative Exploration of Needs and Experiences.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Although psychoeducation for relatives of individuals with a first episode psychosis is important for increasing understanding of psychosis, reducing relapse rates, decreasing hospitalization duration, and improving patient functionality, there is limited research on the specific experiences and needs of relatives of patients with a first episode psychosis. This study aims to explore the experiences and needs of relatives of young adults with first-episode psychosis regarding psychoeducation, with the goal of developing tailored psychoeducation (PE) that can be delivered by nurses. <b>Methods:</b> This qualitative study employed a descriptive, interpretative approach with a total sample of 23 participants, including semi-structured interviews (N = 16), two dyadic interviews (N = 4) and one triadic interview (N = 3). The dyadic interviews included two relatives and two patients, while the triadic interview involved two relatives and one patient. A topic list was utilized to guide the interviews. Thematic analysis was employed to analyse the data, supported by the use of ATLAS.ti. <b>Results:</b> During data analysis, five key themes were identified as relevant for the development of a psychoeducational program: experiences with first-episode psychosis and psychoeducation, the content of PE (what), timing (when), exchanging experiences (how) and joint PE versus separate groups (which format). <b>Conclusions</b>: This study highlights valuable insights and key components for an integrated psychoeducation program, focussing on the needs and experiences of relatives, for the development of the PE program.

40559461,Exploring the Impact of Emotional Eating in Children: A Narrative Review.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Emotional eating has been recognized as the tendency to eat in response to emotions, being recognized as a crucial risk factor for recurrent weight gain. Emotional eating has been interrelated with obesity/overweight, depression, anxiety, stress, and specific dietary habits at any stage of human life, negatively affecting human quality of life. The present study aims to summarize and explore the effects of emotional eating on children and how these effects may, in turn, influence their mental and physical health at the next stages of their lives. <b>Methods</b>: This is a narrative review of the presently existing clinical evidence concerning the impact of emotional eating in children. A comprehensive search of the most reliable online databases, e.g., PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, was performed utilizing relevant keywords. Several inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to collect only cross-sectional, longitudinal, descriptive, and case-control surveys in children's populations. <b>Results:</b> The current clinical evidence suggests that parental behavior may increase the risk of emotional eating in children. Several pieces of evidence also implied potential associations of emotional eating with overweight/obesity and mental disorders in children. Children's dietary habits may also affect their risk of developing emotional eating. <b>Conclusions</b>: The prevalence of emotional eating is gradually increasing in the general population, and especially in children. Public strategies should be performed to educate parents to recognize potential emotional eating behaviors in their children and to adopt more healthy dietary habits for their children, even in the first months of their life.

40559458,Targeting the Roots of Psychosis: The Role of Aberrant Salience.,"Aberrant salience, defined as the inappropriate attribution of significance to neutral stimuli, is increasingly recognized as a critical mechanism in the onset of psychotic disorders. In young individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis, abnormal salience processing may serve as a precursor to full-blown psychotic symptoms, contributing to distorted perceptions and the onset of psychotic ideation. This review examines current literature on aberrant salience among UHR youth, exploring its neurobiological, psychological, and behavioral dimensions. Through a comprehensive analysis of studies involving neuroimaging, cognitive assessments, and symptomatology, we assess the consistency of findings across diverse methodologies. Additionally, we evaluate factors contributing to aberrant salience, including neurochemical imbalances, dysregulation in dopamine pathways, and environmental stressors, which may jointly increase psychosis vulnerability. Identifying aberrant salience as a measurable trait in UHR populations could facilitate earlier identification and targeted interventions. Implications for clinical practice are discussed, highlighting the need for specialized therapeutic approaches that address cognitive and emotional dysregulation in salience attribution. Recent research underscores the importance of aberrant salience in early psychosis research and advocates for further studies on intervention strategies to mitigate progression to psychosis among UHR individuals.",Pediatric reports,2025.0,Giuseppe Marano; Francesco Maria Lisci; Greta Sfratta; Ester Maria Marzo; Francesca Abate; Gianluca Boggio; Gianandrea Traversi; Osvaldo Mazza; Roberto Pola; Eleonora Gaetani; Marianna Mazza,aberrant salience define inappropriate attribution significance neutral stimulus increasingly recognize critical mechanism onset psychotic disorder young individual ultra high risk uhr psychosis abnormal salience processing serve precursor blow psychotic symptom contribute distorted perception onset psychotic ideation review examine current literature aberrant salience uhr youth explore neurobiological psychological behavioral dimension comprehensive analysis study involve neuroimage cognitive assessment symptomatology assess consistency finding diverse methodology additionally evaluate factor contribute aberrant salience include neurochemical imbalance dysregulation dopamine pathway environmental stressor jointly increase psychosis vulnerability identify aberrant salience measurable trait uhr population facilitate early identification target intervention implication clinical practice discuss highlight need specialized therapeutic approach address cognitive emotional dysregulation salience attribution recent research underscore importance aberrant salience early psychosis research advocate study intervention strategy mitigate progression psychosis uhr individual
40559454,Expression and Site-Specific Biotinylation of Human Cytosolic 5'-Nucleotidase 1A in <i>Escherichia coli</i>.,"Autoantibodies targeting cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 1A (cN1A) are found in several autoimmune diseases, including inclusion body myositis (IBM), Sjögren's syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus. While they have diagnostic relevance for IBM, little is known about the autoreactive B cells that produce these antibodies. To address this, we developed a robust protocol for the expression and site-specific biotinylation of recombinant human cN1A in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. The resulting antigen is suitable for generating double-labelled fluorescent baits for the isolation and characterisation of cN1A-specific B cells by flow cytometry. Site-specific biotinylation was achieved using the AviTag and BirA ligase, preserving the protein's structure and immunoreactivity. Western blot analysis confirmed that the biotinylated cN1A was recognised by both human and rabbit anti-cN1A antibodies. Compared to conventional chemical biotinylation, this strategy minimises structural alterations that may affect antigen recognition. This approach provides a reliable method for producing biotinylated antigens for use in immunological assays.

40559452,An Efficient Electroporation Protocol Supporting In Vitro Studies of Oligodendrocyte Biology.,"Oligodendrocytes form myelin in the central nervous system, and their dysfunction can cause severe neurological symptoms, as large-scale analyses have highlighted numerous gene expression alterations in pathological conditions. Although in vivo functional gene analyses are preferable, they have several limitations, especially in large-scale studies. Therefore, standardized in vitro systems are needed to facilitate efficient and reliable functional analyses of genes identified in such studies. Here, we describe a practical and efficient method for oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) isolation from mouse brains on postnatal day 6-8 and a gene delivery method for the isolated OPCs. By modifying the magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) procedure with reduced processing volumes, we simplified OPC isolation, allowing simultaneous handling of multiple samples and improving workflow efficiency. We also optimized electroporation parameters to achieve robust transfection efficiency with minimal cell death. Transfected OPCs are suitable for both monoculture-based differentiation assays and co-culture with dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants, in which they reliably differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes and myelinate along the axons. This system enables stable and reproducible in vitro analysis of oligodendrocyte function, supports investigations into both intrinsic differentiation and neuron-glia interactions, and provides a powerful platform for oligodendrocyte research with efficient and timely gene manipulation.",Methods and protocols,2025.0,Yugo Ishino; Shoko Shimizu; Shingo Miyata,oligodendrocyte form myelin central nervous system dysfunction cause severe neurological symptom large scale analysis highlight numerous gene expression alteration pathological condition vivo functional gene analysis preferable limitation especially large scale study standardize vitro system need facilitate efficient reliable functional analysis gene identify study describe practical efficient method oligodendrocyte precursor cell opc isolation mouse brain postnatal day 6 8 gene delivery method isolated opc modify magnetic activate cell sort macs procedure reduce processing volume simplify opc isolation allow simultaneous handling multiple sample improve workflow efficiency optimize electroporation parameter achieve robust transfection efficiency minimal cell death transfected opc suitable monoculture base differentiation assay co culture dorsal root ganglion drg explant reliably differentiate mature oligodendrocyte myelinate axon system enable stable reproducible vitro analysis oligodendrocyte function support investigation intrinsic differentiation neuron glia interaction provide powerful platform oligodendrocyte research efficient timely gene manipulation
40559326,The C/C Genotype of the C-1019G (rs6295) Polymorphism of the 5-HT1A Receptor Gene Is Associated with Lower Susceptibility to Depressive Symptoms in a Rural Population in Mexico.,"Depression is one of the most prevalent mental health disorders worldwide, affecting a significant proportion of the global population. Its etiology is complex and influenced by the interaction of environmental factors and genetic variations. In Mexico, it has been reported that 41.3% of the population exhibits depressive symptoms. Previous studies have suggested that susceptibility to depression may be associated with the C-1019G (rs6295) polymorphism in the serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptor gene. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association between the C-1019G polymorphism and depressive symptoms in a rural Mexican population. Using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), we examined the effect of C-1019G on depression symptoms, as evaluated by the Beck Depression Inventory. Data were obtained from 83 volunteers; individuals with depressive symptoms and those with a healthy mood were compared. The results showed that the homozygous C/C genotype was found significantly more frequently in the control group than in individuals with depressive symptoms, particularly among men, and is thus associated with a decreased risk of depressive symptomatology.

40559319,Identifying Clinical Measures Related to Falls in Ambulatory Patients with Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy.,"Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult-onset, X-linked, progressive neuromuscular disease caused by abnormal CAG trinucleotide expansion in the androgen receptor gene. Patients with SBMA report difficulty with falls on self-reported activities of daily living scales. To our knowledge, no study has examined the relationship between falls and common clinical measures of strength, balance, mobility, and disease biomarkers. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of an SBMA cohort. The objectives of this study are as follows: (1) compare demographics, clinical measures, and biomarkers between patients who did and did not fall; (2) determine which measures best discriminate fallers from non-fallers; and (3) identify cutoff scores to detect patients with a higher fall risk. Cross-sectional analysis was used. Disease biomarkers included blood serum creatinine, and clinical measures included the Timed Up and Go (TUG), the Adult Myopathy Assessment Tool (AMAT), and posturography, including the Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance and the Motor Control Test. The Maximal Voluntary Isometric Contractions (MVICs) of four lower extremity muscles were captured via fixed-frame dynamometry. We identified three clinical measures that help detect fall risk in people with SBMA. A post hoc receiver operating characteristic curve analysis helped identify cut scores for each test. Impairments of mobility (TUG > 8 s), muscle endurance (AMAT endurance subscale < 14), and muscle strength (ankle plantar flexion MVIC < 45% of predicted) were different between fallers and non-fallers, via independent <i>t</i>-tests.

40559318,Evaluation of Sensory and Motor Function in Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy Using Quiet Stance and Reactive Postural Control.,"Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness, along with muscle cramps, tremors, and sensory neuropathy. Previous research has shown that patients with SBMA have difficulty with dynamic balance and sensory postural control during quiet stance. There have been no reports on automatic postural reactions in SBMA. In this study, we aimed (1) to augment previous findings of sensory postural control, (2) to investigate automatic postural reactions in SBMA, and (3) to explore the relationship between strength and balance. A cross-sectional design was used for the analysis. The participants were fifty male individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of SBMA. Balance testing included the NeuroCom modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance (mCTSIB), which measures sway velocity during quiet stance, and the NeuroCom Motor Control Test (MCT), which measures the latency and strength of postural reactions following sudden perturbations. Strength testing included maximal voluntary isometric contractions measured via fixed-frame dynamometry. Forty-seven out of fifty participants were able to complete the mCTSIB test, but only thirty-eight completed the MCT test. Patients who were unable to complete the MCT were significantly weaker in all lower extremity muscles compared to those who were able to complete testing. Compared to normative data, participants showed significantly higher sway velocity during quiet stance across all conditions of the mCTSIB, except when standing on foam with eyes open. They also exhibited significantly slower postural reactions in response to sudden shifts of the force plate on the MCT. Plantarflexor weakness was significantly correlated with poor postural control on the mCTSIB and MCT. This study confirms previously reported abnormalities of sensory postural control in SBMA and highlights patients' heavy reliance on visual inputs for postural control. Additionally, this study shows that automatic postural corrections are slower than normal in SBMA and provides a unique approach for measuring the combined sensory and motor components of the disease. Both the sensory and automatic balance abnormalities were found to be associated with plantarflexor weakness and may contribute to a higher risk of falls under challenging situations. Therefore, addressing this weakness may be an important step toward fall prevention in this population.",Neurology international,2025.0,Joseph A Shrader; Ashwini Sansare; Allison C Niemic; Rafael Jiménez-Silva; Joshua G Woolstenhulme; Galen O Joe; Uma Jacobs; Angela Kokkinis; Kenneth Fischbeck; Chris Grunseich; Cris Zampieri,spinal bulbar muscular atrophy sbma x link neuromuscular disorder characterize progressive muscle weakness muscle cramp tremor sensory neuropathy previous research show patient sbma difficulty dynamic balance sensory postural control quiet stance report automatic postural reaction sbma study aim 1 augment previous finding sensory postural control 2 investigate automatic postural reaction sbma 3 explore relationship strength balance cross sectional design analysis participant male individual confirm diagnosis sbma balance testing include neurocom modify clinical test sensory interaction balance mctsib measure sway velocity quiet stance neurocom motor control test mct measure latency strength postural reaction follow sudden perturbation strength testing include maximal voluntary isometric contraction measure fix frame dynamometry seven participant able complete mctsib test thirty complete mct test patient unable complete mct significantly weak low extremity muscle compare able complete testing compare normative datum participant show significantly high sway velocity quiet stance condition mctsib stand foam eye open exhibit significantly slow postural reaction response sudden shift force plate mct plantarflexor weakness significantly correlate poor postural control mctsib mct study confirm previously report abnormality sensory postural control sbma highlight patient heavy reliance visual input postural control additionally study show automatic postural correction slow normal sbma provide unique approach measure combine sensory motor component disease sensory automatic balance abnormality find associate plantarflexor weakness contribute high risk fall challenging situation address weakness important step fall prevention population

40559223,The Potential Effects of Sensor-Based Virtual Reality Telerehabilitation on Lower Limb Function in Patients with Chronic Stroke Facing the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Retrospective Case-Control Study.,"Individuals with chronic stroke often experience various impairments, including poor balance, reduced mobility, limited physical activity, and difficulty performing daily tasks. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, telerehabilitation (TR) can overcome the barriers of geographical and physical distancing, time, costs, and travel, as well as the anxiety about contracting COVID-19. In this retrospective case-control study, we aim to evaluate the motor and cognitive effects of balance TR training carried out with a sensor-based non-immersive virtual reality system compared to conventional rehabilitation in chronic stroke patients. Twenty chronic post-stroke patients underwent evaluation for inclusion in the analysis through an electronic recovery data system. The patients included in the study were divided into two groups with similar medical characteristics and duration of rehabilitation training. However, the groups differed in the type of rehabilitation approach used. The experimental group (EG) received TR with a sensor-based VR device, called VRRS-HomeKit (n. 10).

40559122,Post-Coma Neurorehabilitation: Neurophysiological Assessment as an Additional Strategic and Essential Competence for the Physiatrist.,"Neurophysiological techniques, particularly somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and electroencephalography (EEG), are essential tools for the functional and prognostic evaluation of patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness (DoC) in intensive neurorehabilitation settings. This narrative review critically analyzes the most relevant evidence regarding the use of SEPs and EEG in the management of post-comatose patients, highlighting the strategic role of physiatrists in integrating these assessments into individualized rehabilitation plans. A systematic search was conducted across major international databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cinahl, and DiTA) until December 2024, selecting consensus documents, official guidelines (including the 2021 ERC/ESICM guidelines), systematic reviews, observational studies, and significant Italian neurophysiological contributions. The literature supports the strong prognostic value of the bilateral presence of the N20 component in SEPs, while its early bilateral absence, particularly in post-anoxic cases, is a robust predictor of poor neurological outcomes. EEG provides complementary information, with continuous, reactive, and symmetrical patterns associated with favorable outcomes, while pathological patterns, such as burst suppression or isoelectric activity, predict a worse prognosis. Combining SEP and EEG assessments significantly improves prognostic sensitivity and specificity, especially in sedated or metabolically compromised patients. Additionally, the use of direct muscle stimulation (DMS) and nerve conduction studies enables accurate differentiation between central and peripheral impairments, which is crucial for effective rehabilitation planning. Overall, SEPs and EEG should be systematically incorporated into the evaluation and follow-up of DoC patients, and the acquisition of neurophysiological competencies by physiatrists represents a strategic priority for modern, effective, and personalized neurorehabilitation.",Journal of personalized medicine,2025.0,Luigi Di Lorenzo; Carmine D'Avanzo,neurophysiological technique particularly somatosensory evoke potential seps electroencephalography eeg essential tool functional prognostic evaluation patient prolong disorder consciousness doc intensive neurorehabilitation setting narrative review critically analyze relevant evidence use sep eeg management post comatose patient highlight strategic role physiatrist integrate assessment individualized rehabilitation plan systematic search conduct major international database pubmed embase scopus cinahl dita december 2024 select consensus document official guideline include 2021 erc esicm guideline systematic review observational study significant italian neurophysiological contribution literature support strong prognostic value bilateral presence n20 component seps early bilateral absence particularly post anoxic case robust predictor poor neurological outcome eeg provide complementary information continuous reactive symmetrical pattern associate favorable outcome pathological pattern burst suppression isoelectric activity predict bad prognosis combine sep eeg assessment significantly improve prognostic sensitivity specificity especially sedated metabolically compromise patient additionally use direct muscle stimulation dms nerve conduction study enable accurate differentiation central peripheral impairment crucial effective rehabilitation planning overall seps eeg systematically incorporate evaluation follow doc patient acquisition neurophysiological competency physiatrist represent strategic priority modern effective personalize neurorehabilitation
40558673,Cannabinoid Receptor 1 Regulates Zebrafish Renal Multiciliated Cell Development via cAMP Signaling.,"Endocannabinoid signaling plays a significant role in neurogenesis and nervous system physiology, but its roles in the development of other tissues are just beginning to be appreciated. Previous reports have shown the presence of the key endocannabinoid receptor Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1 or Cnr1) in multiciliated (MCC) tissues and its upregulation in kidney diseases, yet the relationship between Cnr1 and renal MCC development is unknown. Here, we report that Cnr1 is essential for cilia development across tissues and regulates renal MCCs via cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling during zebrafish embryogenesis. Using a combination of genetic and pharmacological studies, we found that the loss of function, agonism and antagonism of <i>cnr1</i> all lead to reduced mature renal MCC populations. <i>cnr1</i> deficiency also led to reduced cilia development across tissues, including the pronephros, ear, Kupffer's vesicle (KV), and nasal placode. Interestingly, treatment with the cAMP activator Forskolin (FSK) restored renal MCC defects in agonist-treated embryos, suggesting that <i>cnr1</i> mediates cAMP signaling in renal MCC development. Meanwhile, treatment with the cAMP inhibitor SQ-22536 alone or with <i>cnr1</i> deficiency led to reduced MCC populations, suggesting that <i>cnr1</i> also mediates renal MCC development independently of cAMP signaling. Our findings indicate that <i>cnr1</i> has a critical role in controlling renal MCC development both via cAMP signaling and an independent pathway, further revealing implications for ciliopathies and renal diseases.",Journal of developmental biology,2025.0,Thanh Khoa Nguyen; Sophia Baker; Julienne Angtuaco; Liana Arceri; Samuel Kaczor; Bram Fitzsimonds; Matthew R Hawkins; Rebecca A Wingert,endocannabinoid signaling play significant role neurogenesis nervous system physiology role development tissue begin appreciate previous report show presence key endocannabinoid receptor cannabinoid receptor 1 cb1 cnr1 multiciliated mcc tissue upregulation kidney disease relationship cnr1 renal mcc development unknown report cnr1 essential cilia development tissue regulate renal mcc cyclic amp camp signal zebrafish embryogenesis combination genetic pharmacological study find loss function agonism antagonism < > cnr1</i > lead reduce mature renal mcc population < > cnr1</i > deficiency lead reduce cilia development tissue include pronephro ear kupffer vesicle kv nasal placode interestingly treatment camp activator forskolin fsk restore renal mcc defect agonist treat embryo suggest < > cnr1</i > mediate camp signal renal mcc development treatment camp inhibitor sq-22536 < > cnr1</i > deficiency lead reduce mcc population suggest < > cnr1</i > mediate renal mcc development independently camp signal finding indicate < > cnr1</i > critical role control renal mcc development camp signal independent pathway reveal implication ciliopathie renal disease
40558649,Systematic Review on HRV Reference Values.,"Heart rate variability (HRV) has been established as a measure for the variation in time intervals between successive cardiac actions as a marker of the autonomic nervous system. However, despite many efforts in this field, there are no reference values that are generally accepted. The objective of this systematic review is, therefore, to present an overview of the studies on HRV normal values published to date, with due consideration of any influencing factors. A systematic database query was carried out in PubMed, Scopus, Ovid Medline, and PsychInfo using the search string ""((hrv) or (heart rate variability)) and ((reference values) or (reference range) or (normal values))"". Of the 6640 studies yielded by the query, 58 were used for this systematic review. The STARD-HRV procedure was used to assess the quality of the studies. The studies considered date from 1989 to 2022. The number of subjects examined was between 20 and 84,772. The age of the subjects was between 1 day and 99 years. A total of 51 of the studies examined both male and female subjects. In total, 19 studies used long-term measurements, 22 studies used short-term measurements, and 17 studies used intermediate measuring periods. Many different HRV parameters were analyzed, most often traditional time-domain and frequency-domain ones. Nine studies described the subjects as ""healthy"" without giving more detailed explanations. There are no generally accepted HRV normal values (yet). Some large studies provide values that may be used for orientation purposes. However, further studies are required to collect HRV normal values. It was not possible to merge the results of the studies in terms of a meta-analysis; this would also not be practical since, among other reasons, the consideration of confounders as well as recording and measuring modalities sometimes vary to a large extent and impede the comparability of the studies. Generally, HRV seems to be influenced by various mechanisms and external factors that are still not fully understood. An exploration of these factors will ultimately allow HRV normal values to be obtained in a manner that is generally accepted.",Journal of cardiovascular development and disease,2025.0,Maximillian Brozat; Irina Böckelmann; Stefan Sammito,"heart rate variability hrv establish measure variation time interval successive cardiac action marker autonomic nervous system despite effort field reference value generally accept objective systematic review present overview study hrv normal value publish date consideration influence factor systematic database query carry pubmed scopus ovid medline psychinfo search string hrv heart rate variability reference value reference range normal value 6640 study yield query 58 systematic review stard hrv procedure assess quality study study consider date 1989 2022 number subject examine 20 84,772 age subject 1 day 99 year total 51 study examine male female subject total 19 study long term measurement 22 study short term measurement 17 study intermediate measuring period different hrv parameter analyze traditional time domain frequency domain one study describe subject healthy give detailed explanation generally accept hrv normal value large study provide value orientation purpose study require collect hrv normal value possible merge result study term meta analysis practical reason consideration confounder record measure modality vary large extent impede comparability study generally hrv influence mechanism external factor fully understand exploration factor ultimately allow hrv normal value obtain manner generally accept"
40558566,Muscle Spatial Transcriptomic Reveals Heterogeneous Profiles in Juvenile Dermatomyositis and Persistence of Abnormal Signature After Remission.,"This study aimed to investigate the spatial heterogeneity of molecular signature in the muscle of juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) patients before and after treatment. Unsupervised reference-free deconvolution of spatial transcriptomics and standardized morphometry were performed in two JDM muscle biopsies with different clinical severity at disease onset and compared to healthy muscle. Identified signatures were scored in two additional JDM muscle biopsies from the same patient before and after remission. Disappearance of the normal muscle signature mostly corresponding to mitochondrial biology was observed in JDM. Three pathological transcriptomic signatures were isolated, related to ""myofibrillar stress"", ""muscle remodeling"" and ""interferon signaling"" signatures. The ""myofibrillar stress signature"" was prominent in the most severe biopsy while the ""muscle remodeling"" signature was mostly present in the biopsy from the patient with good outcome. These signatures unveiled genes not previously associated with JDM including ANKRD1 and FSLT1 for ""myofibrillar stress"" and ""muscle remodeling"" signatures, respectively. Post-treatment analysis of muscle after two years remission showed a persistence of pathological signatures. This pilot study of JDM muscle identified spatially distributed pathological signatures that persist after remission.

40558565,Cannabidiol Effects on Depressive-like Behavior and Neuroinflammation in Female Rats Exposed to High-Fat Diet and Unpredictable Chronic Mild Stress.,"Depression and obesity are comorbid conditions linked through shared neuroinflammatory and immune mechanisms. This study examined the effects of chronic cannabidiol (CBD) treatment on behavior and neuroinflammatory gene expression in female rats exposed to a combined model of high-fat diet (HFD) and unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS). Rats were subjected to an acute HFD for 2 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of UCMS. CBD (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle was administered during the final 2 weeks of UCMS. Specifically, mRNA levels of nuclear factor kappa B1 (NF-κB1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and IL-6 were measured in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and CA1. CBD's effects varied depending on the type of stressor. It promoted coping behavior, increased locomotion, reduced freezing, and restored UCMS-induced depressive-like behavior in a splash test. In the vmPFC, CBD normalized the HFD- and UCMS-induced increase in il1β, and downregulated nfkb1 and tnfa expression. In the CA1, it normalized stress-induced downregulation in nfkb1 expression. These findings suggest that the efficacy of CBD in modulating both behavior and neuroinflammation is contingent upon the nature of the stress exposure, highlighting its potential as a targeted treatment for stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders in females.",Cells,2025.0,Tal Sabbag; Milly Kritman; Irit Akirav,depression obesity comorbid condition link share neuroinflammatory immune mechanism study examine effect chronic cannabidiol cbd treatment behavior neuroinflammatory gene expression female rat expose combined model high fat diet hfd unpredictable chronic mild stress ucms rat subject acute hfd 2 week follow 4 week ucms cbd 10 mg kg i.p vehicle administer final 2 week ucms specifically mrna level nuclear factor kappa b1 nf κb1 tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf α interleukin-1 beta il-1β il-6 measure ventromedial prefrontal cortex vmpfc ca1 cbd effect vary depend type stressor promote cope behavior increase locomotion reduce freezing restore ucms induce depressive like behavior splash test vmpfc cbd normalize hfd- ucms induce increase il1β downregulate nfkb1 tnfa expression ca1 normalize stress induce downregulation nfkb1 expression finding suggest efficacy cbd modulate behavior neuroinflammation contingent nature stress exposure highlight potential target treatment stress relate neuropsychiatric disorder female
40558561,"Investigating the Synergistic Neuroprotective Effects of Plant-Derived Antioxidants and the Psychedelic N,N-Dimethyltryptamine in Alzheimer's Disease Therapy.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic and complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline, memory loss, and irreversible impairment of brain functions. The etiology of AD is multifactorial, involving a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and physiological factors, including the aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and oxidative stress (OS). The role of OS in AD pathogenesis is of particular significance, given that an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants promotes cellular damage, exacerbates Aβ deposition, and leads to cognitive deterioration. Despite extensive research, current therapeutic strategies have largely failed, likely due to the use of single-target drugs unable to halt the multifactorial progression of the disease. In this study, we investigated the synergistic therapeutic effect of plant-derived bioactive compounds Withanone, Apigenin, Bacoside A, Baicalin, and Thymoquinone in combination with N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (NN-DMT), a psychedelic molecule. We used a transgenic <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> model to assess the behavioral and molecular outcomes following compound exposure. Motility assays, thioflavin S staining, and survival assays under oxidative stress were employed to evaluate the treatment efficacy. The results of the behavioral and molecular analyses indicated that the combination therapy exhibited a higher efficacy than the monotherapies, leading to a significant reduction in age-related motility defects in the AD model. Furthermore, the combination treatment substantially reduced Aβ plaque burden, enhanced survival following OS insult, and demonstrated a synergistic effect in mitigating AD-related hallmarks.

40558549,Concurrent Physical Activity Protects Against C26 Adenocarcinoma Tumor-Mediated Cardiac and Skeletal Muscle Dysfunction and Wasting in Males.,"Muscle loss unresponsive to nutritional supplementation affects up to 80% of cancer patients and severely reduces survival and treatment response. Exercise may help preserve muscle mass and function, yet the translatability of preclinical methods remains questionable. This study aimed to assess how voluntary wheel running, a clinically relevant physical activity, protects skeletal and cardiac muscle against cancer-mediated dysfunction and identify underlying molecular mechanisms. BALB/c mice were assigned to sedentary nontumor-bearing (SED+NT), sedentary tumor-bearing (SED+T), wheel run nontumor-bearing (WR+NT), and wheel run tumor-bearing (WR+T). Tumor-bearing groups received 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> C26 cells; WR mice had wheel access for 4 weeks. Muscle function and tissue were analyzed for protective mechanisms. SED+T mice exhibited significant fat and lean mass loss, indicating cachexia, which was prevented in WR+T mice. SED+T also showed 15% reduced grip strength and cardiac dysfunction, while WR+T preserved function. WR+T mice had lower expression of muscle wasting markers (Atrogin1, MuRF1, GDF15, GDF8/11).

40558545,Cellular and Molecular Interactions in CNS Injury: The Role of Immune Cells and Inflammatory Responses in Damage and Repair.,"The central nervous system (CNS) is highly susceptible to damage due to its limited ability to regenerate. Injuries to the CNS, whether from trauma, ischemia, or neurodegenerative diseases, disrupt both cellular and vascular structures, leading to immediate (primary) and subsequent (secondary) damage. Primary damage involves the physical disruption of cells and blood vessels, weakening the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and triggering excitotoxicity and calcium overload. Secondary damage develops over hours to days and is marked by ionic imbalance, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation, which further aggravates tissue damage. Inflammation plays a dual role: acute inflammation helps in repair, while chronic inflammation accelerates neurodegeneration. Microglia and astrocytes play key roles in this inflammatory response, with M1-like microglia promoting pro-inflammatory responses and M2-like microglia supporting anti-inflammatory and repair processes. Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins such as Tau, amyloid-beta, TDP-43, and α-synuclein, which impair cellular function and lead to neuronal loss. Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins and influenced by genetic risk factors (e.g., <i>APOE4, TARDBP</i>). Despite the CNS's limited regenerative abilities, processes like synaptogenesis, neurogenesis, axonal regeneration, and remyelination offer potential for recovery. Therapeutic approaches aim to target inflammatory pathways, enhance repair mechanisms, and develop neuroprotective treatments to counter excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Advances in stem cell therapy, gene therapy, and personalized medicine hold promise for improving outcomes. Future research should focus on combining strategies, utilizing advanced technologies, and conducting translational studies to bridge the gap between preclinical research and clinical application. By better understanding and leveraging the complex processes of CNS injury and repair, researchers hope to develop effective therapies to restore function and enhance the quality of life for individuals with CNS disorders.",Cells,2025.0,Jai Chand Patel; Meenakshi Shukla; Manish Shukla,central nervous system cns highly susceptible damage limited ability regenerate injury cns trauma ischemia neurodegenerative disease disrupt cellular vascular structure lead immediate primary subsequent secondary damage primary damage involve physical disruption cell blood vessel weaken blood brain barrier bbb trigger excitotoxicity calcium overload secondary damage develop hour day mark ionic imbalance mitochondrial dysfunction oxidative stress chronic inflammation aggravate tissue damage inflammation play dual role acute inflammation help repair chronic inflammation accelerate neurodegeneration microglia astrocyte play key role inflammatory response m1 like microglia promote pro inflammatory response m2 like microglia support anti inflammatory repair process neurodegenerative disease characterize accumulation misfolde protein tau amyloid beta tdp-43 α synuclein impair cellular function lead neuronal loss neurodegenerative disease characterize accumulation misfolde protein influence genetic risk factor e.g. < > apoe4 tardbp</i > despite cns limited regenerative ability process like synaptogenesis neurogenesis axonal regeneration remyelination offer potential recovery therapeutic approach aim target inflammatory pathway enhance repair mechanism develop neuroprotective treatment counter excitotoxicity oxidative stress apoptosis advance stem cell therapy gene therapy personalize medicine hold promise improve outcome future research focus combine strategy utilize advanced technology conduct translational study bridge gap preclinical research clinical application well understanding leverage complex process cns injury repair researcher hope develop effective therapy restore function enhance quality life individual cns disorder

This necessitates the identification of the genetic variations involved in ASD pathogenesis. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) in a cohort of 22 Bulgarian male and female individuals showing ASD features alongside segregation analyses of their families. A targeted panel of genes was chosen and analyzed for each case, based on a detailed examination of clinical data. Gene analyses revealed that specific variants concern key neurobiological processes involving neuronal architecture, development, and function. These variants occur in a number of genes, including <i>SHANK3</i>, <i>DLG3</i>, <i>NALCN</i>, and <i>PACS2</i> which are critical for synaptic signaling imbalance, <i>CEP120</i> and <i>BBS5</i> for ciliopathies, <i>SPTAN1</i> for spectrins structure, <i>SPATA5</i>, <i>TRAK1</i>, and <i>VPS13B</i> for neuronal organelles trafficking and integrity, <i>TAF6</i>, <i>SMARCB1</i>, <i>DDX3X</i>, <i>MECP2</i>, and <i>SETD1A</i> for gene expression, <i>CDK13</i> for cell cycle control, <i>ALDH5A1, DPYD</i>, <i>FH</i>, and <i>PDHX</i> for mitochondrial function, and <i>PQBP1</i>, <i>HUWE1</i>, and WDR45 for neuron homeostasis.

40558538,Autophagy and Alzheimer's Disease: Mechanisms and Impact Beyond the Brain.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by neuronal loss, cognitive decline, and pathological hallmarks such as amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles. Recent evidence highlights autophagy as a pivotal mechanism in cellular homeostasis, mediating the clearance of misfolded proteins and damaged organelles. However, impaired autophagy contributes significantly to AD pathogenesis by disrupting proteostasis, exacerbating neuroinflammation, and promoting synaptic dysfunction. This review aims to scrutinize the intricate relationship between autophagy dysfunction and AD progression, explaining key pathways including macroautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), and selective autophagy processes such as mitophagy and aggrephagy.

40558537,A Comprehensive Review of the Pathophysiology of Neonatal Stroke and a Critique of Current and Future Therapeutic Strategies.,"Within the first 28 days after birth, more than 1 in every 2500 newborns will suffer a stroke. The weekly-adjusted risk of stroke for a term-born infant is threefold higher than for a male smoker aged 50 to 59 years with hypertension and diabetes. Neonatal stroke has significant clinical and socio-economic consequences, leading to cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and a range of motor, sensory, and cognitive impairments. Currently, there is no treatment for the brain damage caused by neonatal stroke. In this review, we outline the differences in the complex interplay of inflammation, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and cell death after stroke between adults and neonates, which limits the direct transfer of knowledge between studies for understanding injury. We comprehensively document what is known about the pathophysiology of neonatal stroke and critically evaluate current therapeutic strategies, emphasising the urgent need for innovative treatments tailored to suit the neonatal brain. This analysis reveals that treatment with an injectable hydrogel scaffold, a three-dimensional, water-swollen polymer network, may be an innovative, viable approach to improve outcomes for infants suffering from the most severe forms of brain injury arising from neonatal stroke.",Cells,2025.0,Victor Mondal; Emily Ross-Munro; Gayathri K Balasuriya; Ritu Kumari; Md Munnaf Hossen; Mohammed Ageeli; Kate Firipis; David R Nisbet; Glenn F King; Richard J Williams; Pierre Gressens; Jeanie L Y Cheong; Flora Y Wong; David W Walker; Mary Tolcos; Bobbi Fleiss,28 day birth 1 2500 newborn suffer stroke weekly adjust risk stroke term bear infant threefold high male smoker age 50 59 year hypertension diabetes neonatal stroke significant clinical socio economic consequence lead cerebral palsy epilepsy range motor sensory cognitive impairment currently treatment brain damage cause neonatal stroke review outline difference complex interplay inflammation excitotoxicity oxidative stress cell death stroke adult neonate limit direct transfer knowledge study understand injury comprehensively document know pathophysiology neonatal stroke critically evaluate current therapeutic strategy emphasise urgent need innovative treatment tailor suit neonatal brain analysis reveal treatment injectable hydrogel scaffold dimensional water swollen polymer network innovative viable approach improve outcome infant suffer severe form brain injury arise neonatal stroke
40558535,The Evolving Landscape of Functional Models of Autism Spectrum Disorder.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting 1-3% of the population globally. Owing to its multifactorial origin, complex genetics, and heterogeneity in clinical phenotypes, it is difficult to faithfully model ASD. In essence, ASD is an umbrella term for a group of individually rare disorders, each risk gene accounting for <1% of cases, threaded by a set of overlapping behavioral or molecular phenotypes. Validated behavioral tests are considered a gold standard for ASD diagnosis, and several animal models (rodents, pigs, and non-human primates) have traditionally been used to study its molecular basis. These models recapitulate the human phenotype to a varying degree and have been indispensable to preclinical research, but they cannot be used to study human-specific features such as protracted neuronal maturation and cell-intrinsic attributes, posing serious limitations to translatability. Human stem cell-based models, both as monolayer 2D cultures and 3D organoids and assembloids, can circumvent these limitations. Generated from a patient's own reprogrammed cells, these can be used for testing therapeutic interventions that are more condition and patient relevant, targeting developmental windows where the intervention would be most effective. We discuss some of these advancements by comparing traditional and recent models of ASD.",Cells,2025.0,Jai Ranjan; Aniket Bhattacharya,autism spectrum disorder asd neurodevelopmental disorder affect 1 3 population globally owe multifactorial origin complex genetic heterogeneity clinical phenotype difficult faithfully model asd essence asd umbrella term group individually rare disorder risk gene account < 1 case thread set overlap behavioral molecular phenotype validate behavioral test consider gold standard asd diagnosis animal model rodent pig non human primate traditionally study molecular basis model recapitulate human phenotype vary degree indispensable preclinical research study human specific feature protract neuronal maturation cell intrinsic attribute pose limitation translatability human stem cell base model monolayer 2d culture 3d organoid assembloid circumvent limitation generate patient reprogrammed cell test therapeutic intervention condition patient relevant target developmental window intervention effective discuss advancement compare traditional recent model asd
40558534,Development of Positron Emission Tomography Radiotracers for Imaging α-Synuclein Aggregates.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) that are characterized by the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates in both neurons and the non-neuronal cells of the brain are called synucleinopathies. The most common synucleinopathies includes Parkinson's disease (PD), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Significant progress has been made in the development of positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers for synucleinopathies, yielding several α-syn tracers that have entered clinical studies. However, selective α-syn imaging still faces inherent challenges. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the progress in α-syn PET radiotracers from three angles: Alzheimer's disease (AD)-derived scaffolds, representative compound scaffolds and analogs, and the identification of α-syn tracers through high-throughput screening (HTS). We discuss the characteristics, advantages, and limitations of the tracers for preclinical and clinical application. Finally, future directions in the development of radioligands for proteinopathies are discussed. There is no clinical available PET radiotracer for imaging α-syn aggregates, but these advances have laid a key foundation for non-invasive α-syn imaging and early diagnosis of synucleinopathies.",Cells,2025.0,Xiaodi Guo; Jie Xiang; Keqiang Ye; Zhentao Zhang,neurodegenerative disease ndd characterize accumulation alpha synuclein α syn aggregate neuron non neuronal cell brain call synucleinopathie common synucleinopathie include parkinson disease pd parkinson disease dementia pdd multiple system atrophy msa dementia lewy body dlb significant progress development positron emission tomography pet radiotracer synucleinopathie yield α syn tracer enter clinical study selective α syn imaging face inherent challenge review provide comprehensive overview progress α syn pet radiotracer angle alzheimer disease ad)-derived scaffold representative compound scaffold analog identification α syn tracer high throughput screening hts discuss characteristic advantage limitation tracer preclinical clinical application finally future direction development radioligand proteinopathie discuss clinical available pet radiotracer image α syn aggregate advance lay key foundation non invasive α syn imaging early diagnosis synucleinopathie
40558519,Multi-Modal Analysis of Satellite Cells Reveals Early Impairments at Pre-Contractile Stages of Myogenesis in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.,"Recent studies on myogenic satellite cells (SCs) in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) documented altered division capacities and impaired regeneration potential of SCs in DMD patients and animal models. It remains unknown, however, if SC-intrinsic effects trigger these deficiencies at pre-contractile stages of myogenesis rather than resulting from the pathologic environment. In this study, we isolated SCs from a porcine DMD model and age-matched wild-type (WT) piglets for comprehensive analysis. Using immunofluorescence, differentiation assays, traction force microscopy (TFM), RNA-seq, and label-free proteomic measurements, SCs behavior was characterized, and molecular changes were investigated. TFM revealed significantly higher average traction forces in DMD than WT SCs (90.4 ± 10.5 Pa vs. 66.9 ± 8.9 Pa; <i>p</i> = 0.0018). We identified 1390 differentially expressed genes and 1261 proteins with altered abundance in DMD vs. WT SCs. Dysregulated pathways uncovered by gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis included sarcomere organization, focal adhesion, and response to hypoxia. Multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA) integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data, identified five factors accounting for the observed variance with an overall higher contribution of the transcriptomic data. Our findings suggest that SC impairments result from their inherent genetic abnormality rather than from environmental influences.

40558513,"Ultrasound-Mediated Drug Diffusion, Uptake, and Cytotoxicity in a Glioblastoma 3D Tumour Sphere Model.","A myriad of biological effects can be stimulated by ultrasound (US) for the treatment of cancer. The objective of our research was to investigate the effect of ultrasound alone and in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin (DOX) and temozolomide (TMZ) on human glioblastoma (GBM) and the human epidermoid carcinoma cancer 2D and 3D cell cultures. The results indicated that the US 96-probe device could induce tumour sphere cytotoxicity in a dosage- and time-dependent manner, with multiple treatments augmenting this cytotoxic effect. With enhanced cytotoxicity, US decreased tumour sphere growth metabolic activity, disrupted spheroid integrity, and heightened the occurrence of DNA double strand breaks, resulting in damage to tumour spheres and an inability to rebuild tumour spheres after multiple US treatments. The combination of US and TMZ/DOX enhanced the efficiency of treatment for GBM and epidermoid carcinoma by enhancing induced cytotoxicity in 3D tumour spheres compared to 2D monolayer cells and also by increasing the incubation time, which is the most crucial way to differentiate between the effectiveness of drug treatment with and without US. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that US enhances drug diffusion, uptake, and cytotoxicity using 3D spheroid models when compared with 2D cultures.

40558500,Modulating Cognition-Linked Histone Acetyltransferases (HATs) as a Therapeutic Strategy for Neurodegenerative Diseases: Recent Advances and Future Trends.,"Recent investigations into the neuroepigenome of the brain are providing unparalleled understanding into the impact of post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histones in regulating dynamic gene expression patterns required for adult brain cognitive function and plasticity. Histone acetylation is one of the most well-characterized PTMs shown to be required for neuronal function and cognition. Histone acetylation initiates neural circuitry plasticity via chromatin control, enabling neurons to respond to external environmental stimuli and adapt their transcriptional responses accordingly. While interplay between histone acetylation and deacetylation is critical for these functions, dysregulation during the aging process can lead to significant alterations in the neuroepigenetic landscape. These alterations contribute to impaired cognitive functions, neuronal cell death, and brain atrophy, all hallmarks of age-related neurodegenerative disease. Significantly, while age-related generation of DNA mutations remains irreversible, most neuroepigenetic PTMs are reversible. Thus, manipulation of the neural epigenome is proving to be an effective therapeutic strategy for neuroprotection in multiple types of age-related neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) that include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington's disease (HD). Here, we highlight recent progress in research focusing on specific HAT-based neuroepigenetic mechanisms that underlie cognition and pathogenesis that is hallmarked in age-related NDs. We further discuss how these findings have potential to be translated into HAT-mediated cognitive-enhancing therapeutics to treat these debilitating disorders.",Cells,2025.0,Huong Anh Mai; Christina M Thomas; Gu Gu Nge; Felice Elefant,recent investigation neuroepigenome brain provide unparalleled understanding impact post translational modification ptm histone regulate dynamic gene expression pattern require adult brain cognitive function plasticity histone acetylation characterize ptm show require neuronal function cognition histone acetylation initiate neural circuitry plasticity chromatin control enable neuron respond external environmental stimulus adapt transcriptional response accordingly interplay histone acetylation deacetylation critical function dysregulation age process lead significant alteration neuroepigenetic landscape alteration contribute impair cognitive function neuronal cell death brain atrophy hallmark age relate neurodegenerative disease significantly age relate generation dna mutation remain irreversible neuroepigenetic ptm reversible manipulation neural epigenome prove effective therapeutic strategy neuroprotection multiple type age relate neurodegenerative disorder nds include alzheimer disease ad parkinson disease pd amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als huntington disease hd highlight recent progress research focus specific hat base neuroepigenetic mechanism underlie cognition pathogenesis hallmarke age relate nds discuss finding potential translate hat mediate cognitive enhance therapeutic treat debilitate disorder
40558498,Gut Microbiota in a Viral Model of Multiple Sclerosis: Modulation and Pitfalls by Oral Antibiotic Treatment.,"Viral infections have been associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), an immune-mediated disease in the central nervous system (CNS). Since Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) can induce MS-like demyelination, TMEV infection is the most widely used viral model for MS. Although the precise pathophysiology is unknown, altered fecal bacterial populations were associated with distinct immune gene expressions in the CNS. We aimed to determine the role of gut microbiota in TMEV infection by administering an antibiotic cocktail in drinking water before (prophylactic administration) or after (therapeutic administration) TMEV infection. The antibiotic administration reduced total eubacteria, including the phyla <i>Bacillota</i> and <i>Bacteroidota</i>, but increased the phylum <i>Pseudomonadata</i> in feces. Prophylactic administration did not alter TMEV-induced inflammatory demyelination clinically or histologically, without changes in anti-viral IgG1/IgG2c levels or lymphoproliferative responses; therapeutic administration temporarily suppressed the neurological signs. Although antibiotic treatment had minimal effects on TMEV infection, adding metronidazole and ampicillin in drinking water substantially reduced water intake in the antibiotic group of mice, resulting in significant body weight loss. Since dehydration and stress could affect immune responses and gut microbiota, caution should be exercised when planning or evaluating the oral antibiotic cocktail treatment in experimental animals.",Cells,2025.0,Ijaz Ahmad; Seiichi Omura; Sundar Khadka; Fumitaka Sato; Ah-Mee Park; Sandesh Rimal; Ikuo Tsunoda,viral infection associate multiple sclerosis ms immune mediate disease central nervous system cns theiler murine encephalomyelitis virus tmev induce ms like demyelination tmev infection widely viral model ms precise pathophysiology unknown alter fecal bacterial population associate distinct immune gene expression cns aim determine role gut microbiota tmev infection administer antibiotic cocktail drinking water prophylactic administration therapeutic administration tmev infection antibiotic administration reduce total eubacteria include phyla < > bacillota</i > < > bacteroidota</i > increase phylum < > pseudomonadata</i > fece prophylactic administration alter tmev induce inflammatory demyelination clinically histologically change anti viral igg1 igg2c level lymphoproliferative response therapeutic administration temporarily suppress neurological sign antibiotic treatment minimal effect tmev infection add metronidazole ampicillin drinking water substantially reduce water intake antibiotic group mouse result significant body weight loss dehydration stress affect immune response gut microbiota caution exercise plan evaluate oral antibiotic cocktail treatment experimental animal

The aim of this study was to discover and characterize in vitro a radioligand for imaging α-syn pathology. A library of 78 small molecules was developed and screened using recombinant α-syn fibrils and brain homogenates from Alzheimer's disease (AD) donors.

40558493,5' DREDGE: Direct Repeat-Enabled Downregulation of Gene Expression via the 5' UTR of Target Genes.,"Despite the availability of numerous methods for controlling gene expression, there remains a strong need for technologies that maximize two key properties: selectivity and reversibility. To this end, we developed a novel approach that exploits the highly sequence-specific nature of CRISPR-associated endoribonucleases (Cas RNases), which recognize and cleave short RNA sequences known as direct repeats (DRs). In this approach, referred to as DREDGE (direct repeat-enabled downregulation of gene expression), selective control of gene expression is enabled by introducing one or more DRs into the untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs, which can then be cleaved upon expression of the cognate Cas RNase. We previously demonstrated that the expression of target genes with DRs in their 3' UTRs are efficiently controlled by the DNase-dead version of Cas12a (dCas12a) with a high degree of selectivity and complete reversibility. Here, we assess the feasibility of using DREDGE to regulate the expression of genes with DRs inserted in their 5' UTRs. Among the five different Cas RNases tested, Csy4 was found to be the most efficient in this context, yielding robust downregulation with rapid onset in doxycycline-regulatable systems targeting either a stably expressed fluorescent protein or an endogenous gene, both in a fully reversible manner. Unexpectedly, dCas12a was also found to be modestly effective despite binding essentially irreversibly to the cut mRNA on its 5' end and thereby boosting mRNA levels. Our results expand the utility of DREDGE as an attractive method for regulating gene expression in a targeted, highly selective, and fully reversible manner.",Cells,2025.0,Sagar J Parikh; Heather M Terron; Luke A Burgard; Dylan D Butler; Frank M LaFerla; Shelley Lane; Malcolm A Leissring,despite availability numerous method control gene expression remain strong need technology maximize key property selectivity reversibility end develop novel approach exploit highly sequence specific nature crispr associate endoribonuclease cas rnases recognize cleave short rna sequence know direct repeat drs approach refer dredge direct repeat enable downregulation gene expression selective control gene expression enable introduce dr untranslated region utrs target mrnas cleave expression cognate cas rnase previously demonstrate expression target gene dr 3 utr efficiently control dnase dead version cas12a dcas12a high degree selectivity complete reversibility assess feasibility dredge regulate expression gene dr insert 5 utr different cas rnases test csy4 find efficient context yield robust downregulation rapid onset doxycycline regulatable system target stably express fluorescent protein endogenous gene fully reversible manner unexpectedly dcas12a find modestly effective despite bind essentially irreversibly cut mrna 5 end boost mrna level result expand utility dredge attractive method regulate gene expression target highly selective fully reversible manner
40558456,Assessing the Role of EEG Biosignal Preprocessing to Enhance Multiscale Fuzzy Entropy in Alzheimer's Disease Detection.,"Quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) has emerged as a promising tool for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among QEEG measures, Multiscale Fuzzy Entropy (MFE) shows great potential in identifying AD-related changes in EEG complexity. However, MFE is intrinsically linked to signal amplitude, which can vary substantially among EEG systems, and this hinders the adoption of this metric for AD detection. To overcome this issue, this study investigates different preprocessing strategies to make the calculation of MFE less dependent on the specific amplitude characteristics of the EEG signals at hand. This contributes to generalizing and making more robust the adoption of MFE for AD detection. To demonstrate the robustness of the proposed preprocessing methods, binary classification tasks with Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifiers are used. Performance metrics, such as classification accuracy and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), are employed to assess the results. The methodology is validated on two public EEG datasets. Results show that amplitude transformation, particularly normalization, significantly enhances AD detection, achieving mean classification accuracy values exceeding 80% with an uncertainty of 10% across all classifiers. These results highlight the importance of preprocessing in improving the accuracy and the reliability of EEG-based AD diagnostic tools, offering potential advancements in patient management and treatment planning.",Biosensors,2025.0,Pasquale Arpaia; Maria Cacciapuoti; Andrea Cataldo; Sabatina Criscuolo; Egidio De Benedetto; Antonio Masciullo; Marisa Pesola; Raissa Schiavoni,quantitative electroencephalography qeeg emerge promising tool detect alzheimer disease ad qeeg measure multiscale fuzzy entropy mfe show great potential identify ad relate change eeg complexity mfe intrinsically link signal amplitude vary substantially eeg system hinder adoption metric ad detection overcome issue study investigate different preprocessing strategy calculation mfe dependent specific amplitude characteristic eeg signal hand contribute generalize make robust adoption mfe ad detection demonstrate robustness propose preprocessing method binary classification task support vector machines svms random forest rf k nearest neighbor knn classifier performance metric classification accuracy matthews correlation coefficient mcc employ assess result methodology validate public eeg dataset result amplitude transformation particularly normalization significantly enhance ad detection achieve mean classification accuracy value exceed 80 uncertainty 10 classifier result highlight importance preprocesse improve accuracy reliability eeg base ad diagnostic tool offer potential advancement patient management treatment planning
40558453,Sudomotor Dysfunction as an Early Marker of Autonomic and Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes: Insights from a Cross-Sectional Study Using SUDOSCAN.,"Diabetic neuropathy, particularly in its autonomic form, is often underdiagnosed despite its clinical significance. Electrochemical skin conductance (ESC), measured by SUDOSCAN, offers a non-invasive way to assess the autonomic dysfunction. A total of 288 diabetic patients were assessed using SUDOSCAN to measure ESC in the hands and feet. Clinical and laboratory parameters, including glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, lipid profile, and cardiovascular risk, were analyzed for correlations with ESC. Neuropathy status was evaluated, and ROC analysis was performed to assess diagnostic accuracy. Sudomotor dysfunction was prevalent, particularly in patients with a diabetes duration exceeding 20 years (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Men showed significantly higher right foot ESC than women (76.5 ± 13.1 vs. 74.0 ± 13.5 µS, <i>p</i> = 0.041). A strong inverse correlation was found between cardiovascular risk score and right foot ESC (r = -0.455, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Left foot ESC also correlated inversely with cardiovascular risk (r = -0.401, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and HbA1c (r = -0.150, <i>p</i> = 0.049), while a weak positive correlation was seen with BMI (r = 0.145, <i>p</i> = 0.043). ROC analysis showed the highest area under the curve (AUC) in right foot ESC for autonomic neuropathy (AUC = 0.750, 95% CI: 0.623-0.877, <i>p</i> < 0.001).

40558449,Influence of Gait Speed on Inter-Joint Coordination in People with and Without Parkinson's Disease.,"The influence of gait speed on lower-extremity coordination while walking in people with Parkinson's disease (pwPD) is poorly understood. This study sought to investigate the relationship between gait speed and hip-knee coordination and coordination variability in older adults and pwPD. A total of 27 pwPD and 21 healthy older adults were recruited. Participants walked in a straight line at slow, preferred, and fast walking speeds. Gait data were collected using inertial measurement units, and the kinematics of the hip and knee were calculated. Coordination and coordination variability at the hip-knee joint pair were determined using continuous relative phase. A repeated measures two-way ANCOVA tested the impact of gait speed on coordination and coordination variability, while group differences were evaluated using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Neither the healthy older adults nor the pwPD adjusted their hip-knee coordination in response to changes in gait speed. pwPD also displayed a trend towards restricted hip and knee joint excursion compared to older adults, which may further limit their ability to adapt gait strategies. These findings suggest that interventions addressing both joint excursion and motor adaptability may be important for improving gait function in individuals with Parkinson's disease. Real-world applicability can be found in the potential of wearable sensors to become a valuable tool in routine clinical practice for both diagnosis and ongoing management.

40558447,Wearable Ultrasound-Imaging-Based Visual Feedback (UVF) Training for Ankle Rehabilitation of Chronic Stroke Survivors: A Proof-of-Concept Randomized Crossover Study.,"This study investigated the effect of wearable ultrasound-imaging-based visual feedback (UVF) on assisting paretic ankle dorsiflexion training of chronic stroke survivors. Thirty-three participants with unilateral hemiplegia performed maximal isometric contractions on an isokinetic dynamometer in randomized conditions with and without UVF that provided by a wearable ultrasound imaging system. Torque parameters (mean, peak, percentage of maximal voluntary contraction) and tibialis anterior muscle thickness were analyzed across different contraction phases. Statistical comparisons were conducted using paired <i>t</i>-tests or Wilcoxon tests. Correlation analyses were performed using Pearson's or Spearman's tests. Results demonstrated that UVF significantly improved torque output, as evidence by the increased percentage of maximal voluntary contraction (%MVC) during entire contractions (<i>p</i> = 0.007), increased mean (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.022) and peak (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.044) torque and the %MVC (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.004) during mid and end phases, and larger muscle thickness during mid contraction (<i>p</i> = 0.045). Moderate correlations were found between torque and muscle thickness (r ≥ 0.30, <i>p</i> ≤ 0.049). These findings preliminarily supported the positive outcomes of real-time wearable UVFs in enhancing paretic ankle dorsiflexion strength and force control during isometric contractions in chronic stroke survivors.

40558429,Novel Device for Intraoperative Quantitative Measurements of Extraocular Muscle Tensile Strength.,"Understanding the tensile properties of extraocular muscles (EOMs) is crucial for successful strabismus surgery and accurate predictions of surgical outcomes. Assessments of EOM tensile strength are traditionally highly dependent on the expertise of the ophthalmic surgeon, since they involve manually pulling the EOM in opposite directions. This approach only provides subjective measurements that are not quantifiable. Previous quantitative approaches have utilized various devices such as implanted force transducers or dial tension gauges connected to muscle tendons with nylon sutures, but these methods are complex and so are rarely used outside of research settings. Consequently, the goal of this study was to create a quantitative and clinically applicable device for assessing EOM tensile strength. This developed device uses a strabismus hook connected to a strain gauge load cell that measures the tensile force and includes a tilting sensor to ensure that the hook is pulled at a consistent angle when a force is applied. The performance of the device was tested on 22 EOMs in 11 patients with intermittent exotropia during surgery for resecting the medial rectus (MR) and recessing the lateral rectus (LR) under general anesthesia. The measured tensile strengths of the MR and LR were 284.9 ± 58.3 and 278.3 ± 64.6 g (mean ± SD), respectively. In conclusion, the novel device developed in this study for quantitative measurements of EOM tensile strength in clinical settings will facilitate understanding of the pathophysiology of strabismus, as well as of the mechanical properties of the EOMs, and enhance the precision of surgical interventions.",Biosensors,2025.0,Hyun Jin Shin; Minung Park; Hyunkyoo Kang; Andrew G Lee,understand tensile property extraocular muscle eoms crucial successful strabismus surgery accurate prediction surgical outcome assessment eom tensile strength traditionally highly dependent expertise ophthalmic surgeon involve manually pull eom opposite direction approach provide subjective measurement quantifiable previous quantitative approach utilize device implant force transducer dial tension gauge connect muscle tendon nylon suture method complex rarely outside research setting consequently goal study create quantitative clinically applicable device assess eom tensile strength develop device use strabismus hook connect strain gauge load cell measure tensile force include tilt sensor ensure hook pull consistent angle force apply performance device test 22 eom 11 patient intermittent exotropia surgery resect medial rectus mr recess lateral rectus lr general anesthesia measured tensile strength mr lr 284.9 ± 58.3 278.3 ± 64.6 g mean ± sd respectively conclusion novel device develop study quantitative measurement eom tensile strength clinical setting facilitate understanding pathophysiology strabismus mechanical property eom enhance precision surgical intervention
40558309,A Neuropsychiatric Prelude to Unveiling Small Cell Lung Cancer with Suspected Paraneoplastic Limbic Encephalitis: A Case Report.,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive form of lung cancer characterized by rapid growth and early metastases. As a neuroendocrine tumour, SCLC is especially notorious for various paraneoplastic syndromes, one of which is a rare neurological syndrome called paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (PLE) that manifests with amnestic cognitive impairment and seizures. Here, we describe a case of a 53-year-old female who presented with neuropsychiatric symptoms of delusions, hallucinations, and cognitive impairment that started months prior to being diagnosed with extensive-stage SCLC. With no previous neuropsychiatric history, this raised the question of whether her presentation was related to PLE rather than a primary psychiatric condition, as initially diagnosed. Her symptoms improved with chemotherapy and radiation treatment of the underlying cancer, favouring a paraneoplastic etiology. Overall, this case underscores the importance of considering paraneoplastic syndromes in patients presenting with new neuropsychiatric symptoms, as early recognition and treatment can improve prognosis.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2025.0,Jessa Letargo; X Melody Qu; Timothy K Nguyen; Alexander V Louie; Sara Kuruvilla; Enxhi Kotrri,small cell lung cancer sclc aggressive form lung cancer characterize rapid growth early metastasis neuroendocrine tumour sclc especially notorious paraneoplastic syndrome rare neurological syndrome call paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis ple manifest amnestic cognitive impairment seizure describe case 53 year old female present neuropsychiatric symptom delusion hallucination cognitive impairment start month prior diagnose extensive stage sclc previous neuropsychiatric history raise question presentation relate ple primary psychiatric condition initially diagnose symptom improve chemotherapy radiation treatment underlie cancer favour paraneoplastic etiology overall case underscore importance consider paraneoplastic syndrome patient present new neuropsychiatric symptom early recognition treatment improve prognosis
40558288,Population-Based Real-World Outcomes of Post-Operative Adjuvant Brain Cavity Radiotherapy Versus Observation.,"To evaluate the factors influencing the outcomes of patients who underwent surgical resection of brain metastasis followed by either surveillance or post-operative stereotactic radiosurgery/fractionated radiotherapy (SRS/SFRT), a retrospective multi-center chart review was performed on all patients who underwent brain metastases resection in British Columbia between 2018 and 2020. Patients with prior whole-brain radiotherapy were excluded from the study. The primary study endpoints included local recurrence, distant intracranial control, radionecrosis (RN), leptomeningeal disease (LMD), and overall survival (OS). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze survival. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to perform univariable (UVA) and multivariable (MVA) analyses to identify predictors of local control. A total of 113 patients met the inclusion criteria. A total of 31 patients received adjuvant SRS/SFRT to the surgical cavity, while 82 went on observation. The 12-month local control was 69% (50-88%) for the SRS/SFRT cohort and 31% (18-45%) for the observation cohort (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The 12-month distant intracranial control was 44% (26-63%) for the SRS/SFRT cohort and 46% (30-62%) for the observation cohort (<i>p</i> = 0.9). Sensitivity analysis did not show a difference in overall survival (<i>p</i> = 0.6). En bloc resection (<i>p</i> < 0.05), resection without residual disease (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and SRS/SFRT (<i>p</i> < 0.001) were predictive of local control on MVA. Three SRS/SFRT patients (10%) and two observation patients (2%) developed LMD. Four SRS/SFRT patients experienced RN (13%), with no grade 3 or higher toxicities observed. Post-operative SRT outcomes based on real-world population data are consistent with the data from clinical trials and support the established guidelines. For patients requiring surgical resection of brain metastasis, en bloc gross total resection should be encouraged when feasible to reduce local recurrence.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2025.0,Zhang Hao Jim Li; Linden Lechner; Jennifer Wang; Nan Hui Susan Yao; Andrew Lee; Serge Makarenko; Mostafa Fatehi; Herve H F Choi; Ermias Gete; Fred Hsu; Waseem Sharieff; Shrinivas Rathod; Hannah Carolan; Jessica Chan; Roy Ma; Alan Nichol; Thi Nghiem; Justin Oh,evaluate factor influence outcome patient undergo surgical resection brain metastasis follow surveillance post operative stereotactic radiosurgery fractionate radiotherapy srs sfrt retrospective multi center chart review perform patient undergo brain metastasis resection british columbia 2018 2020 patient prior brain radiotherapy exclude study primary study endpoint include local recurrence distant intracranial control radionecrosis rn leptomeningeal disease lmd overall survival os kaplan meier method analyze survival cox proportional hazard model perform univariable uva multivariable mva analyse identify predictor local control total 113 patient meet inclusion criterion total 31 patient receive adjuvant srs sfrt surgical cavity 82 go observation 12 month local control 69 50 88 srs sfrt cohort 31 18 45 observation cohort < > p</i > < 0.001 12 month distant intracranial control 44 26 63 srs sfrt cohort 46 30 62 observation cohort < > p</i > = 0.9 sensitivity analysis difference overall survival < > p</i > = 0.6 en bloc resection < > p</i > < 0.05 resection residual disease < > p</i > < 0.05 srs sfrt < > p</i > < 0.001 predictive local control mva srs sfrt patient 10 observation patient 2 develop lmd srs sfrt patient experience rn 13 grade 3 high toxicity observe post operative srt outcome base real world population datum consistent datum clinical trial support establish guideline patient require surgical resection brain metastasis en bloc gross total resection encourage feasible reduce local recurrence
40558230,Administering Parenteral Medications in Managing Patients with Acute Arousal in the Behavioral Assessment Unit of the Emergency Department in Hospital Settings.,"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: The administration of parenteral medications is essential in managing acute arousal within the Behavioral Assessment Unit (BAU) of the emergency department (ED), where timely and effective intervention is critical. This study aims to evaluate current practices surrounding the use of parenteral medications for patients with acute agitation, focusing on adherence to protocols, medication safety, documentation accuracy, and patient outcomes. <b>Methods</b>: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 177 cases from December 2023 to February 2024. The study assessed the demographics, diagnoses, treatment protocols, and patient outcomes, with a particular emphasis on the use of parenteral medications such as benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. The relationship between medication administration and involuntary admission, mechanical restraint usage, and patient outcomes was also explored. <b>Results</b>: The majority of patients were aged between 21 and 30 years, and there was a predominance of male patients across both groups. Schizophrenia was the most common diagnosis, with a higher prevalence in the parenteral group (34%) compared to the oral-only group (24%), and personality disorders were more frequent in the parenteral group. Intramuscular (IM) medication administration was strongly associated with the use of mechanical restraint, with patients receiving IM medication being 35 times more likely to require restraint, emphasizing the link between more intensive treatment approaches and behavioral challenges. The most frequently administered medications were diazepam (40.6%) and olanzapine (36.5%), with olanzapine, droperidol, and diazepam most commonly used parenterally. Documentation of physical assessments prior to parenteral administration was present in most cases, though comprehensive evaluations such as ECGs were inconsistently performed. <b>Conclusions</b>: Parenteral medications, including benzodiazepines and antipsychotics, were effective in rapidly stabilizing patients, but the study emphasizes reducing dependency on mechanical restraints. Tailoring treatment to patient characteristics and employing alternative de-escalation strategies can improve safety and align with recovery-oriented care. This study highlights the need for evidence-based practices to optimize care and improve patient outcomes in ED settings.

40558119,Evaluating Obstructive Sleep Apnea Utilizing Arterial Tonometry in Individuals with Cystic Fibrosis.,"Poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness are commonly reported by individuals with cystic fibrosis. The potential impact of comorbid sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), particularly obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), has not been extensively studied in the CF population. At present, there are no specific recommendations available to help clinicians identify patients with CF who are at increased risk of sleep disorders. Home sleep apnea testing using a validated peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) device may offer an accurate diagnosis of OSA in a more convenient and low-cost method than in-lab polysomnography. In this single-center study of 19 adults with CF, we found an increased prevalence of OSA among individuals with CF compared to general population estimates. Although associations with an FEV < 70% predicted and a modified Mallampati score ≥ 3 were observed, these odds ratios did not reach statistical significance, likely reflecting limited power in this small pilot sample. There was no association found between the self-reported presence of nocturnal cough or snoring and OSA. We also found no association between OSA and abnormal scores on commonly used, validated sleep questionnaires, suggesting that CF-specific scales may be needed for effective screening in the CF clinic.",Advances in respiratory medicine,2025.0,Michelle Chiu; Bethany Bartley; Elizabeth Gootkind; Salma Batool-Anwar; Donald G Keamy; Thomas Bernard Kinane; Lael M Yonker; Kevin S Gipson,poor sleep quality excessive daytime sleepiness commonly report individual cystic fibrosis potential impact comorbid sleep disorder breathing sdb particularly obstructive sleep apnea osa extensively study cf population present specific recommendation available help clinician identify patient cf increase risk sleep disorder home sleep apnea testing validate peripheral arterial tonometry pat device offer accurate diagnosis osa convenient low cost method lab polysomnography single center study 19 adult cf find increase prevalence osa individual cf compare general population estimate association fev < 70 predict modify mallampati score ≥ 3 observe odd ratio reach statistical significance likely reflect limited power small pilot sample association find self report presence nocturnal cough snoring osa find association osa abnormal score commonly validate sleep questionnaire suggest cf specific scale need effective screening cf clinic
40558113,Environmental Factors Affecting Sleep Quality in Intensive Care Unit Patients in Southern Morocco: An Assessment Study.,"Sleep disturbances are a common and often underestimated complication during intensive care unit (ICU) stays. These disturbances can significantly impact patients' recovery and overall well-being. This study aimed to assess the sleep quality of ICU patients and investigate the environmental and clinical factors that affect sleep quality during their ICU stay. We conducted a six-month cross-sectional study involving patients who had stayed in the ICU for at least three nights and were oriented to time and place upon discharge. Sleep quality was assessed using the Arabic version of the Freedman Sleep Questionnaire. Both environmental factors (e.g., noise, light, and nursing interventions) and clinical variables (illness severity and pain) were examined. The differences across three time periods were analyzed using the Wilcoxon test and Spearman's correlation. Multiple regression analysis identified the factors influencing sleep quality. Statistical analyses were performed using JAMOVI software (version 2.3.28). The study enrolled 328 patients, with an average age of 49.74 ± 17.89 years. Of the participants, 75.3% were adults. The primary reasons for admission were circulatory distress (45.73%) and metabolic disorders (24.09%). Sleep quality was significantly lower in the ICU compared to patients' sleep at home (Z = -14.870, <i>p</i> < 0.001). The EVA and APACHE II scores had a statistically significant effect on sleep quality (<i>p</i> < 0.001 and <i>p</i> = 0.015, respectively). In contrast, the Charlson and Quick SOFA scores did not show significant effects (<i>p</i> = 0.128 and <i>p</i> = 0.894). Environmental factors, including noise (<i>p</i> = 0.008), light (<i>p</i> = 0.009), and nursing interventions (<i>p</i> = 0.009), significantly impacted sleep quality. Patients in the ICU generally reported poor sleep quality. Our findings suggest that improving pain management, minimizing environmental noise, and reducing staff-related disturbances could significantly enhance sleep quality for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).",Advances in respiratory medicine,2025.0,Abdelmajid Lkoul; Keltouma Oumbarek; Youssef Bouchriti; Asmaa Jniene; Tarek Dendane,sleep disturbance common underestimate complication intensive care unit icu stay disturbance significantly impact patient recovery overall study aim assess sleep quality icu patient investigate environmental clinical factor affect sleep quality icu stay conduct month cross sectional study involve patient stay icu night orient time place discharge sleep quality assess arabic version freedman sleep questionnaire environmental factor e.g. noise light nursing intervention clinical variable illness severity pain examine difference time period analyze wilcoxon test spearman correlation multiple regression analysis identify factor influence sleep quality statistical analysis perform jamovi software version 2.3.28 study enrol 328 patient average age 49.74 ± 17.89 year participant 75.3 adult primary reason admission circulatory distress 45.73 metabolic disorder 24.09 sleep quality significantly low icu compare patient sleep home z = -14.870 < > p</i > < 0.001 eva apache ii score statistically significant effect sleep quality < > p</i > < 0.001 < > p</i > = 0.015 respectively contrast charlson quick sofa score significant effect < > p</i > = 0.128 < > p</i > = 0.894 environmental factor include noise < > p</i > = 0.008 light < > p</i > = 0.009 nursing intervention < > p</i > = 0.009 significantly impact sleep quality patient icu generally report poor sleep quality finding suggest improve pain management minimize environmental noise reduce staff relate disturbance significantly enhance sleep quality patient intensive care unit icu
40558110,"Malnutrition, Sarcopenia, and Malnutrition Sarcopenia Syndrome in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.","<b>Introduction:</b> Idiopathic pulmonaryy fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease with a poor prognosis. While comorbidities like pulmonary hypertension and lung cancer have been studied extensively, less attention has been paid to the implications of malnutrition and sarcopenia in patients with IPF. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of malnutrition, sarcopenia, and the combined malnutrition-sarcopenia syndrome in patients with IPF using the latest diagnostic criteria from the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) and the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2 (EWGSOP2). <b>Methods:</b> A prospective, observational, multicenter study was conducted, focusing on patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). All participants provided informed consent, and the study followed ethical guidelines. Malnutrition was diagnosed based on the GLIM criteria, requiring one phenotypic and one etiological criterion, with muscle mass assessed via bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Sarcopenia was screened following the EWGSOP2 recommendations. The statistical analysis was performed using JAMOVI version 2.3.22, with significance set at <i>p</i> < 0.05. <b>Results:</b> The findings revealed that 77.65% of the participants were malnourished, and 20% had sarcopenia. The malnourished patients had significantly lower body weight, height, and muscle mass compared to the non-malnourished patients. Furthermore, the patients with malnutrition exhibited poorer health-related quality of life scores. This study also identified the malnutrition-sarcopenia syndrome in 8.23% of the participants. <b>Conclusions:</b> Malnutrition, based on the GLIM criteria was identified in three out of four patients with IPF, while sarcopenia according to the EWGSOP2 was present in one out of five.

40558063,Intravenous Immunoglobulin Elevates Regulatory T Cells in Guillain-Barré Syndrome: A Potential Biomarker of Therapeutic Response.,"Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is the primary treatment for Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), yet its immunological mechanisms underlying variable clinical outcomes remain unclear. This study investigated the immunomodulatory effect of IVIg on regulatory T cells (Tregs), cytokines, and their association with treatment response and clinical outcomes. In this prospective case-controlled study, 57 GBS patients and 57 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were investigated. CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Treg percentages, cytokine production (IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-12), and serum C3 levels were measured using flow cytometry, Luminex assay, and turbidimetric methods, respectively. Treatment response was defined as ≥ 1-point GBS-disability score improvement during evaluation. GBS patients exhibited lower CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs frequencies compared to HCs (p = 0.006), which were inversely associated with serum C3 levels (p = 0.003) during the acute phase. At 4 weeks post-onset, patients with normal C3 levels (90-180 mg/dL) exhibited higher Treg frequencies (p = 0.005) compared to acute GBS, whereas patients with persistently elevated C3 levels showed reduced Treg percentage (p = 0.009). Among I VIg-treated patients, Tregs significantly increased at 2 and 4 weeks post-treatment, alongside significantly higher IL-10 and lower TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-12 levels at 4 weeks. However, patients with supportive care showed no such changes in Tregs and cytokine levels. Furthermore, Tregs elevated significantly in patients responsive to IVIg at 2 and 4 weeks (p < 0.05), but not in non-responsive or supportive care patients. IVIg treatment modulates immune dysregulation in GBS by expanding CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs and altering cytokines and serum C3 levels, which are associated with clinical improvement.

40558042,[Sample Preparation and Sequencing Efficiency of microRNA Libraries from Pituitary Adenoma Tissue and Blood Plasma of Patients with Acromegaly for the Illumina Platform].,"MicroRNAs in tissues and biological fluids represent a promising class of biomarkers for the molecular diagnostics and therapy of numerous diseases, including oncological diseases. Biomarkers based on easily accessible biological fluids, primarily blood-based biomarkers, are of particular value for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. To explore the potential of microRNAs as prognostic cancer markers and targets for molecular therapy, global microRNA profiling is required, which is provided by next-generation sequencing (NGS). NGS offers high sensitivity, single nucleotide resolution, and the possibility of profiling a large number of samples in parallel. Despite the promising potential of microRNAs as biomarkers and the growing number of works in this area, the literature does not address in sufficient detail the problems associated with sample preparation methods, the specifics of library preparation for microRNA sequencing, and the difficulties of quantitative analysis. Protocols for creating libraries for microRNA sequencing present specific challenges and require selecting conditions for each type of biological sample.

This study aimed to identify the complications that are prominent in each age group by comparing 28,082 patients with NF1 and 84,246 matched controls. Benign and malignant neoplasms along with neurological complications were the primary contributors to hospital use across most age groups. Respiratory and circulatory disorders were a common cause of hospital use in children and older adults, respectively.

40557954,The Influence of Menstrual Cycle Phases on Postconcussion Outcomes and Symptom Reporting: A Scoping Review.,"Concussion is common in sports and often shows sex-based differences in symptom severity and recovery, with female athletes experiencing more severe, prolonged symptoms. Hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle may play a role in concussion, but research on this topic has been limited. Therefore, this scoping review aimed to investigate whether the menstrual cycle phase-both at the time of injury and after injury-influences postconcussion outcomes and symptom reporting, and whether menstrual cycle phases influence baseline assessments in the absence of injury. This review was conducted according to PRISMA-ScR guidelines and included studies on the influence of menstrual cycle phases on concussion-related outcomes retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, and BISp-Surf databases. Five studies involving 774 females identified variations in symptom severity and health outcomes across menstrual cycle phases, with differences between the luteal and follicular phases. Findings suggest that hormonal fluctuations, particularly the withdrawal of elevated progesterone during the luteal phase, may contribute to worse postconcussion symptoms and outcomes, with these hormone levels at the time of injury emerging as a potential predictor of recovery severity. Baseline assessment evaluations should account for menstrual cycle phase, because this influences symptom variability and severity. This review underscores the importance of incorporating menstrual cycle phases into concussion management strategies in order to enhance diagnostic accuracy and recovery approaches for female athletes. Addressing these hormonal influences can advance both research and practice in the management of concussion.",Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,2025.0,Gina Carr; Marie-Therese Fleddermann,concussion common sport show sex base difference symptom severity recovery female athlete experience severe prolonged symptom hormonal change menstrual cycle play role concussion research topic limit scope review aim investigate menstrual cycle phase time injury injury influence postconcussion outcome symptom reporting menstrual cycle phases influence baseline assessment absence injury review conduct accord prisma scr guideline include study influence menstrual cycle phase concussion relate outcome retrieve pubmed web science bisp surf database study involve 774 female identify variation symptom severity health outcome menstrual cycle phase difference luteal follicular phase finding suggest hormonal fluctuation particularly withdrawal elevated progesterone luteal phase contribute bad postconcussion symptom outcome hormone level time injury emerge potential predictor recovery severity baseline assessment evaluation account menstrual cycle phase influence symptom variability severity review underscore importance incorporate menstrual cycle phase concussion management strategy order enhance diagnostic accuracy recovery approach female athlete address hormonal influence advance research practice management concussion
40557918,Digital Mental Health Tools and AI Therapy Chatbots: A Balanced Approach to Regulation.,"Digital mental health tools (DMHTs) offer a potential solution to overcoming economic, cultural, and geographic barriers to the increasing demand for mental health care, but their adoption raises significant ethical, legal, and social concerns. This article identifies ethical risks related to DMHTs and, in this light, proposes three important criteria for evaluating regulatory approaches. These approaches should (a) ensure widespread access and (b) balance access with risk management while (c) acknowledging preexisting markets and digital self-medication.

40557917,DWORF expression is reduced in a large animal model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal muscle-wasting disease driven by cytosolic calcium overload, which leads to muscle degeneration. Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA), a key regulator of cytosolic calcium levels, exhibits reduced activity in animal models of DMD and human patients. Dwarf open reading frame (DWORF), a positive SERCA regulator, is downregulated in mdx DMD mice, and adeno-associated virus-mediated DWORF overexpression has been shown to ameliorate DMD cardiomyopathy. The canine DMD model provides a crucial bridge for translating findings from mice to humans. To investigate DWORF expression in this model, we developed a canine-specific anti-DWORF antibody, as the existing murine antibody is ineffective. This antibody detected DWORF in human, pig, cat and rabbit muscle, but not in mouse muscle. DWORF was absent in muscle tissues of neonatal normal dogs but highly expressed in those of adult dogs. In DMD-affected dogs aged 8 months or older, DWORF expression was significantly reduced in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. This study establishes a foundation for evaluating DWORF-based gene therapy in the canine DMD model, advancing the potential for clinical translation.",Disease models & mechanisms,2025.0,Aaron M Gibson; Xiufang Pan; Omar Brito-Estrada; James A Teixeira; Lauren K Carl; Yongping Yue; Michael L Kamradt; Matthew J Burke; Caris A Wadding-Lee; Gang Yao; Roland W Herzog; Dongsheng Duan; Catherine A Makarewich,duchenne muscular dystrophy dmd lethal muscle waste disease drive cytosolic calcium overload lead muscle degeneration sarco endoplasmic reticulum calcium atpase serca key regulator cytosolic calcium level exhibit reduce activity animal model dmd human patient dwarf open reading frame dworf positive serca regulator downregulate mdx dmd mouse adeno associate virus mediate dworf overexpression show ameliorate dmd cardiomyopathy canine dmd model provide crucial bridge translate finding mouse human investigate dworf expression model develop canine specific anti dworf antibody exist murine antibody ineffective antibody detect dworf human pig cat rabbit muscle mouse muscle dworf absent muscle tissue neonatal normal dog highly express adult dog dmd affect dog age 8 month old dworf expression significantly reduce cardiac skeletal muscle study establish foundation evaluate dworf base gene therapy canine dmd model advance potential clinical translation

Consecutive drug-naïve patients with narcolepsy underwent two days of continuous PSG recording, the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), then night-PSG and, on the following day, MWT. MWT results were correlated with MSLT and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Patients in the two lower tertiles of MWT mean sleep latency (mSL) were compared to those in the upper tertile. Seventy-eight NT1 (30.6 ± 11.4 years, 35 males) and 19 NT2 (31.0 ± 9.9 years, 12 males) were included. MWT results showed a bimodal distribution with a large peak with reduced mSL and a small peak with values towards 40 minutes. MWT mSL was lower in NT1 than in NT2 (10.7 ± 10.8 min vs 23.9 ± 11.5 min, p<.001). In the entire sample, lower MWT mSL was moderately correlated with lower MSLT mSL (Rho = 0.347, p=.001) and higher ESS (Rho = -0.398, p<.001). Patients with NT1 with MWT mSL in the two lower tertiles (≤11.2 min) had higher ESS than those in the upper tertile, without any difference in other clinical or neurophysiological features. In NT2, no significant correlations emerged between MWT, MSLT, and ESS. MWT mSL is reduced in drug-naive narcolepsy, more severely in NT1 than in NT2.

This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial in China. Adults aged 18-75 years meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5®) criteria for insomnia disorder, with a baseline Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) ≥15, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive daridorexant 50 mg or placebo once every evening for 1 month. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to month 1 in wake time after sleep onset (WASO) assessed by polysomnography (PSG). The secondary endpoints included the change from baseline to month 1 in subjective total sleep time (sTST) and in latency to persistent sleep (LPS). In addition to the standardized collection of AEs, safety data specific to insomnia treatment were assessed as follows: withdrawal symptoms, rebound insomnia, and next-day residual effects. 206 participants were enrolled and evenly randomized to each group. Compared with the placebo group, the daridorexant group showed a significant reduction in WASO (-15.4 min, p=.0009), a significant increase in sTST (16.8 min, p=.021) and a significant reduction in LPS (geometric mean ratio to placebo 0.7, p=.001) from baseline to month 1.

40557874,Maraviroc Prevents Optic Nerve Injury-Induced Retinal Ganglion Cell Apoptosis by Modulating the CCL5/CCR5/CTSS Axis.,"Optic nerve crush (ONC) is an animal model that induces optic nerve injury and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death, which is partly mediated by activated microglia secreting cytokines. This study explores the role of the CCL5/CCR5 pathway in RGC damage and evaluates maraviroc, a CCR5 inhibitor, as a potential therapeutic agent. Bioinformatic analysis of glaucoma datasets (GSE142881 and GSE26299) identified Ccr5 as a key gene linked to acute or chronic RGC injury. The ONC model was used to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of maraviroc or sh-Ccr5 using immunofluorescence, TUNEL staining, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and electrophysiological tests. Co-culture of neuro2a cells with activated BV2 cells examined mechanisms, and intravitreal maraviroc safety and efficacy were evaluated using histological and molecular assays. CCR5 was significantly associated with RGC injury in both datasets. Inhibition of CCR5 via maraviroc preserved RGC structure, maintained ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness, and improved retinal function in the ONC model. Mechanistically, CCR5 inhibition prevented Cathepsin S (CTSS) downregulation and neuron apoptosis induced by ONC or activated microglia. Intravitreal maraviroc administration was safe, preserving retinal structure and RGC count in non-injured eyes while reducing RGC damage in ONC-injured eyes. Microglial activation in glaucoma upregulates CCL5, triggering CCR5-mediated RGC apoptosis via CTSS downregulation.

40557858,Cross-sectoral collaboration of mental health problems in children and adolescents.,"A growing number of children and adolescents (CA) suffer from mental health problems. To provide the necessary investigation and care, collaboration between general practitioners (GPs) and the municipality is essential, but often challenging. This study aimed to identify factors influencing intersectoral collaboration between general practice and municipalities when treating CA with mental health problems and to propose improvements to this collaboration. We conducted interviews with seven GPs and three municipal employees (MEs). The data were analysed with inspiration from thematic analysis. The results were framed within Gittell's theory of relational coordination. GPs and MEs expressed frustration and challenges encountered when working with CA due to inefficient intersectoral collaboration. Many GPs expressed a need for better communication with municipal authorities or child psychiatry departments. MEs also experienced challenges related to this collaboration. Successful collaboration appeared when dedicated individuals from both sectors actively worked for improvements. Key factors identified for enhancing collaboration included personal knowledge, regular contact, awareness of activities in the other sector and improved communication channels. We propose enhanced cross-sectoral communication, routine information exchange and further development of digital tools to improve collaboration.

40557830,"Peripheral venous blood gas analysis for the diagnosis of respiratory failure, hypercarbia and metabolic disturbance in adults.","Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) is the reference standard for the diagnosis of respiratory failure (RF) and metabolic disturbance (MD), but peripheral venous blood gas analysis (PVBGA) is increasingly being used for the estimation of carbon dioxide, pH, and other variables in the context of acutely unwell adults presenting to hospitals and emergency departments. The primary objective of this review is to evaluate the performance of PVBGA by comparing it with the reference standard ABGA, which is assumed to be error-free for the diagnosis of (1) respiratory failure, (2) hypercarbia, and (3) metabolic disturbance (the three target conditions) in adults. The secondary objective is to evaluate the performance of the index test to diagnose nine specific subtypes of respiratory failure and metabolic disturbance. The definitions for these additional conditions are determined by changes to one or more of the following: pH (acidity), pO<sub>2</sub> (partial pressure of oxygen), pCO<sub>2</sub> (partial pressure of carbon dioxide), HCO<sub>3</sub> (bicarbonate), as stated in the Methods section of this review (target conditions). We aimed to explore the following covariates: participant demographics (e.g. age, weight, and sex); participant comorbidities (e.g. chronic lung disease, chest wall deformity, and central nervous system disorder such as spinal cord injury); and the indication for blood gas sampling (e.g. shortness of breath, critical illness, resuscitation, trauma, or whilst under general anaesthesia). On 10 July 2024, we searched the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and LILACS. We also manually searched 19 respiratory and critical care journals, and we searched ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials. We considered consecutive series studies and case-control studies that directly compared the index test PVBGA to the reference standard ABGA for adults over the age of 16 years. The included studies contained data for any one of the target conditions of respiratory failure and metabolic disturbance, as determined by individual changes to pO<sub>2</sub> (partial pressure of oxygen), pCO<sub>2</sub> (partial pressure of carbon dioxide), pH (acidity), and HCO<sub>3</sub> (bicarbonate) concentration. Studies that only provided mean values for summed data were ineligible for inclusion. However, we invited authors of such studies to provide individual patient data for inclusion in this systematic review. There are nine studies awaiting classification. Two authors independently evaluated the quality of the relevant studies and extracted data from them. We conducted a quality assessment using the QUADAS-2 tool. Our statistical analysis used 2 x 2 tables for the positive and negative results of each test. We estimated a bivariate meta-analysis of sensitivity and specificity. We included six studies (919 participants) in our quantitative analysis. All studies were at high risk of bias due to one or more of the following factors: patient selection, since it was unclear if consecutive patients were included or where they were located; index test, with poor reporting of cut-offs; flow and timing domain because the fraction of inspired oxygen was frequently not stated and any difference between the collection of the VBGA and the ABGA could introduce bias. Respiratory failure For the diagnosis of respiratory failure of any type, when using PVBGA, the estimated summary sensitivity (Sn) was 97.6% (95% credible interval (CI) 94.1 to 99.4) and the estimated summary specificity (Sp) was 36.9% (95% CI 17.1 to 60.1) (6 studies, 805 participants of whom 291 (36%) were diagnosed with respiratory failure by ABGA; sensitivity: low-certainty evidence; specificity: very low certainty evidence). Isolated hypercarbia For the diagnosis of isolated hypercarbia (regardless of oxygen level), when using PVBGA, the estimated summary Sn was 97.1% (95% CI 93.3 to 99.2); the estimated summary Sp value was 53.9% (95% CI 39.8 to 66.7) (6 studies with 805 participants, 269 (33%) with ABGA confirmation; low-certainty evidence). Other findings Results for metabolic disturbance and our secondary target conditions are presented in the full review. Very limited data suggest PVBGA performs poorly as a diagnostic test for respiratory failure compared to the reference standard of ABGA. The index test PVBGA was highly sensitive for the diagnosis of respiratory failure and isolated hypercarbia, but its specificity was poor for these two primary target conditions. The high sensitivity means PVBGA may have a useful role as a ""rule out test"" for respiratory failure and isolated hypercarbia; however, the high false-positive rates make the clinical interpretation of a positive test difficult. Moreover, we are uncertain regarding these estimates because we have only low to very low certainty about the evidence.

However, improvements in prevention, treatment access, and outcomes have been slow, and research priorities have not always been aligned with the needs and interests of affected communities. In this commentary, we call on the field to think critically about how to maximize not only the volume but also the real-world impact of the next 50 years of eating disorder research. In particular, we highlight the importance of creating a research ecosystem that nurtures methodological diversity and centers collaborative, participatory research in partnership with people with lived experience. We also underscore the importance of conducting inclusive research that makes space for the full diversity of eating disorder presentations and the people who experience them.

40557529,Brain-Body Interactions in Ischemic Stroke: VNS Reprograms Microglia and FNS Enhances Cerebellar Neuroprotection.,"Stroke significantly impacts mortality and long-term disability, necessitating effective rehabilitation strategies to enhance recovery. This review examines the roles of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and fastigial nucleus stimulation (FNS) in facilitating ischemic stroke recovery through brain-body interactions. VNS enhances ischemic stroke recovery by reprogramming microglia from proinflammatory (M1) to neuroprotective (M2) phenotypes, reducing neuroinflammation and promoting tissue repair via neurotrophic factors. It has shown promise in clinically improving chronic upper limb deficits when combined with rehabilitation therapies. Conversely, FNS provides cerebellar-mediated neuroprotection by mainly mitigating excitotoxic damage and inflammatory responses independent of cerebral blood flow alterations, as evidenced by preclinical models of middle cerebral artery occlusion. By integrating VNS-driven immunomodulation with FNS-mediated excitotoxicity suppression, this review highlights their synergistic potential to improve rehabilitation outcomes for ischemic stroke survivors. Biomarker-guided protocols: VNS for cortical/subcortical ischemic deficits and FNS for cerebellar network recovery are advocated to address postischemic disability via anti-inflammatory rewiring, neuroplasticity enhancement, and cerebellar-thalamocortical circuit stabilization. Critical gaps remain in hemorrhagic stroke, where FNS's excitotoxicity suppression may destabilize clots, necessitating subtype-specific safety validations.",Stroke,2025.0,Yuchun Wang; Zhe Yang; Jinling Wang; Minyan Ge; Nianhong Wang; Shumao Xu,stroke significantly impact mortality long term disability necessitate effective rehabilitation strategy enhance recovery review examine role vagus nerve stimulation vns fastigial nucleus stimulation fns facilitate ischemic stroke recovery brain body interaction vns enhance ischemic stroke recovery reprogramme microglia proinflammatory m1 neuroprotective m2 phenotype reduce neuroinflammation promote tissue repair neurotrophic factor show promise clinically improve chronic upper limb deficit combine rehabilitation therapy conversely fns provide cerebellar mediate neuroprotection mainly mitigate excitotoxic damage inflammatory response independent cerebral blood flow alteration evidence preclinical model middle cerebral artery occlusion integrate vns drive immunomodulation fns mediate excitotoxicity suppression review highlight synergistic potential improve rehabilitation outcome ischemic stroke survivor biomarker guide protocol vns cortical subcortical ischemic deficit fns cerebellar network recovery advocate address postischemic disability anti inflammatory rewiring neuroplasticity enhancement cerebellar thalamocortical circuit stabilization critical gap remain hemorrhagic stroke fns excitotoxicity suppression destabilize clot necessitating subtype specific safety validation
40557524,Associations Between Tinnitus and Hearing Loss Among Noise-Exposed Workers in the United States From 1999 to 2020: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"ImportanceTinnitus is a prevalent condition among noise-exposed workers, with significant implications for hearing health and quality of life. Identifying associated factors can inform prevention and management strategies.ObjectivesTo identify factors associated with tinnitus prevalence among noise-exposed workers and assess the effectiveness of hearing protection in mitigating tinnitus.DesignCross-sectional study.SettingData from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys database.ParticipantsThis study included 4931 noise-exposed workers (mean age 48.9 ± 0.3 years). Participants were categorized into speech-frequency hearing loss (SFHL; n = 1032, mean age 67.2 ± 0.4 years) and high-frequency hearing loss (HFHL; n = 1634, mean age 62.9 ± 0.3 years) groups based on hearing threshold levels.Intervention or ExposuresNoise exposure duration, hearing loss severity, demographics, and medical history. Hearing protection usage was assessed for its effectiveness in preventing tinnitus.Main Outcome MeasuresPrimary outcome: tinnitus prevalence. Associations were analyzed using logistic regression, with factors including self-reported noise exposure, hearing loss severity, demographics, and medical history.ResultTinnitus prevalence was 32.85% in the group with SFHL and 29.99% in the group with HFHL. Prolonged noise exposure and greater hearing loss severity were associated with tinnitus in both groups. Hearing protection usage was potentially linked to a lower tinnitus prevalence in HFHL but not in SFHL. For SFHL, univariate analysis showed lower tinnitus prevalence in older age and females, while Caucasian ethnicity and higher income were associated with higher prevalence. Multivariate analysis indicated that older age was positively associated with tinnitus (<i>P</i> < .05). In HFHL, factors such as higher BMI, higher educational level, and elevated Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9) scores were significantly associated with tinnitus prevalence.ConclusionsProlonged noise exposure and hearing loss severity among noise-exposed workers were associated with tinnitus prevalence in SFHL and HFHL. Hearing protection showed tendency to reduce tinnitus prevalence in HFHL but had a limited effect in SFHL. Higher BMI, higher education levels, and elevated PHQ9 scores were significantly associated with tinnitus in HFHL, warranting further research into protective strategies.RelevanceFuture studies should explore alternative protective strategies for SFHL patients and refine tinnitus prevention approaches in noise-exposed workers.",Journal of otolaryngology - head & neck surgery = Le Journal d'oto-rhino-laryngologie et de chirurgie cervico-faciale,2025.0,Shuo-Wei Yang; Wei Xu; Lin Chen; Shu-Bin Fang,importancetinnitus prevalent condition noise expose worker significant implication hear health quality life identify associated factor inform prevention management strategy objectivesto identify factor associate tinnitus prevalence noise expose worker assess effectiveness hear protection mitigate tinnitus designcross sectional study settingdata national health nutrition examination surveys database participantsthis study include 4931 noise expose worker mean age 48.9 ± 0.3 year participant categorize speech frequency hearing loss sfhl n = 1032 mean age 67.2 ± 0.4 year high frequency hearing loss hfhl n = 1634 mean age 62.9 ± 0.3 year group base hear threshold level intervention exposuresnoise exposure duration hear loss severity demographic medical history hear protection usage assess effectiveness prevent tinnitus main outcome measuresprimary outcome tinnitus prevalence association analyze logistic regression factor include self report noise exposure hear loss severity demographic medical history resulttinnitus prevalence 32.85 group sfhl 29.99 group hfhl prolonged noise exposure great hearing loss severity associate tinnitus group hear protection usage potentially link low tinnitus prevalence hfhl sfhl sfhl univariate analysis show low tinnitus prevalence old age female caucasian ethnicity high income associate high prevalence multivariate analysis indicate old age positively associate tinnitus < > p</i > < .05 hfhl factor high bmi high educational level elevate patient health questionnaire-9 phq9 score significantly associate tinnitus prevalence conclusionsprolonged noise exposure hear loss severity noise expose worker associate tinnitus prevalence sfhl hfhl hearing protection show tendency reduce tinnitus prevalence hfhl limited effect sfhl high bmi high education level elevate phq9 score significantly associate tinnitus hfhl warrant research protective strategy relevancefuture study explore alternative protective strategy sfhl patient refine tinnitus prevention approach noise expose worker
40557431,Anatomical classification of septum pellucidum variations and analysis of the co-occurrence of the variations with psychiatric disorders.,"This study sought to categorize anatomical variations of the septum pellucidum (SP), cavum vergae (CV), and cavum veli interpositi (CVI), as well as to examine potential correlations between these variations and psychiatric disorders. A total of 2949 patients were retrospectively analyzed utilizing brain MRIs. Variations were categorized into nine types according to the coexistence of CSP and CVI in either mild or moderate manifestations. The prevalence of CSP, CV, and CVI in the study population was 7.9%, 1.4%, and 9.0%, respectively, with an overall occurrence of variation at 13.8%. A chi-square test indicated a significant correlation between moderate CSP with mild CVI (Type VIII) and a reduced prevalence of psychiatric disorders (<i>p</i> = .007), implying a possible protective effect. Nevertheless, the majority of SP variations exhibited no statistically significant correlation with psychiatric diagnoses, including schizophrenia, OCD, or bipolar disorder. Logistic regression analysis revealed a significant interaction between gender and SP variations in predicting psychiatric disorders, with females exhibiting a higher overall prevalence. The interaction term was statistically significant (<i>p</i> < .001), suggesting that variations in SP and gender collectively affect the probability of psychiatric disorders. The findings offer valuable insights; however, limitations including the retrospective design, small subgroup sizes, and absence of genetic data necessitate caution in result interpretation.

40557424,Fluorometric Nanoscale Analysis of Bilirubin and Biliverdin in Human Cerebrospinal Fluid.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a valuable source for the quantification of soluble, brain-specific biomarkers supporting the diagnosis of some neurological disorders, infectious diseases, and suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage. Given the increasing need to expand the basic knowledge of brain pathophysiology for disease biomarker discovery, we set the goal to quantify bilirubin and biliverdin in human CSF. Their concentrations are expected to reflect the level of brain heme catabolism, a key pathway involved in the biological response to oxidative stress.

40557328,Subtle changes in Purkinje cell firing in Purkinje cell-specific <i>Dyt1 ΔGAG</i> knock-in mice.,"DYT1 dystonia is an inherited early-onset generalized dystonia characterized by sustained muscle contractions causing abnormal, repetitive movements or postures. Most DYT1 patients have a heterozygous trinucleotide GAG deletion (<i>ΔGAG</i>) in <i>DYT1/TOR1A</i>, coding for torsinA. <i>Dyt1</i> heterozygous ΔGAG knock-in (KI) mice or global KI mice show motor deficits and abnormal Purkinje cell firing. However, Purkinje cell-specific heterozygous ΔGAG conditional KI mice (Pcp2-KI) show improved motor performance, reduced sensory-evoked brain activation in the striatum and midbrain, and reduced functional connectivity of the striatum with the anterior medulla. Whether Pcp2-KI mice show similar abnormal Purkinje cell firing as the global KI mice, suggesting a cell-autonomous effect causes the abnormal Purkinje cell firing in the global KI mice, is unknown. We used acute cerebellar slice recording in Pcp2-KI mice to address this issue. The Pcp2-KI mice exhibited no changes in spontaneous firing and intrinsic excitability compared to the control mice. While membrane properties were largely unchanged, the resting membrane potential was slightly hyperpolarized, which was associated with decreased baseline excitability. Our results suggest that the abnormal Purkinje cell firing in the global KI mice was not cell-autonomous and was caused by physiological changes elsewhere in the brain circuits. Our results also contribute to the ongoing research of how basal ganglia and cerebellum interact to influence motor control in normal states and movement disorders.","Dystonia (Lausanne, Switzerland)",2025.0,Hong Xing; Pallavi Girdhar; Yuning Liu; Fumiaki Yokoi; David E Vaillancourt; Yuqing Li,dyt1 dystonia inherit early onset generalize dystonia characterize sustained muscle contraction cause abnormal repetitive movement posture dyt1 patient heterozygous trinucleotide gag deletion < > δgag</i > < > dyt1 tor1a</i > code torsina. < > dyt1</i > heterozygous δgag knock ki mouse global ki mouse motor deficit abnormal purkinje cell firing purkinje cell specific heterozygous δgag conditional ki mouse pcp2 ki improve motor performance reduce sensory evoke brain activation striatum midbrain reduce functional connectivity striatum anterior medulla pcp2 ki mouse similar abnormal purkinje cell fire global ki mouse suggest cell autonomous effect cause abnormal purkinje cell fire global ki mouse unknown acute cerebellar slice recording pcp2 ki mouse address issue pcp2 ki mouse exhibit change spontaneous firing intrinsic excitability compare control mouse membrane property largely unchanged rest membrane potential slightly hyperpolarize associate decrease baseline excitability result suggest abnormal purkinje cell fire global ki mouse cell autonomous cause physiological change brain circuit result contribute ongoing research basal ganglia cerebellum interact influence motor control normal state movement disorder
40557281,Lactate levels during anesthesia in patients undergoing craniopharyngioma surgery.,"To assess the incidence of hyperlactatemia and lactic acidosis in patients undergoing craniopharyngioma surgery and to investigate their association with surgical outcomes. We analyzed clinical data from all patients who underwent craniopharyngioma surgery between 2019 and 2023 at a tertiary care center. Arterial blood gas analyses were performed prior to anesthesia and at one-hour intervals during surgery. Patients were classified into three groups: the Lactic Acidosis group (LA), Hyperlactatemia group (HL), and Normal Control group (NC). The primary outcome was the occurrence of postoperative severe hypernatremia (serum sodium levels exceeding 155 mmol/L). We enrolled 261 patients with a mean age of 41.7 years. During anesthesia, mean lactate levels increased from 1.4 [1.0-1.9] mmol/L at initiation to 4.6 [1.8-7.0] mmol/L after 8 h. Among the cohort, 44 patients (16.9%) were classified in the HL group and 31 patients (11.9%) in the LA group. Anesthesia duration was the sole factor significantly associated with increased lactate levels in both univariate and multivariable analyses (OR 1.50 [95% CI: 1.31-1.80], <i>p</i> < 0.001). The elevated lactate level was independently associated with hypernatremia, even after adjusting for potential confounders, with an odds ratio of 2.12 (95% CI: 1.04-4.24, <i>p</i> = 0.038). No significant differences were observed among the three groups regarding total hospital stay, ICU stay, or incidence of severe complications.

40557249,"The Effectiveness of Low-Level LED Light Therapy for Sleep Problems, Psychological Symptoms, and Heart Rate Variability in Shift-Work Nurses: A Randomized Controlled Trial.","<b>Background:</b> Shift-work schedules can cause sleep and psychological problems among nurses, negatively affecting their health and quality of life. This trial examined the effects of low-energy light therapy on sleep, psychological symptoms, and heart rate variability among shift-work nurses. <b>Methods:</b> This randomized controlled trial was conducted from July 2021 to June 2022. The inclusion criteria were nurses with self-reported insomnia who worked in shifts in the last 6 months in a medical center in northern Taiwan. Block randomization was used to assign the study participants to two groups: experimental (<i>n</i> = 32) and control (<i>n</i> = 32). A portable Meridian Aura Cap equipped with a low-level light-emitting diode was used to provide red and near-infrared light (660 and 850 nm) for 30 min, three times a week for 4 weeks; the control group did not receive any intervention. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 and Insomnia Severity Index were used to measure psychological symptoms and sleep problems, respectively. Heart rate variability was measured by the ANSWatch. <b>Results:</b> No significant differences were reported in preintervention scores. After the 4-week intervention, the intervention group scored significantly lower in insomnia (4.3 vs. 12.6, respectively; <i>p</i> < 0.001), depression (2.5 vs. 7.9, <i>p</i> < 0.001), anxiety (3.1 vs. 9.2, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and stress (5.6 vs. 12, <i>p</i> < 0.001) than those in the controls. No significant differences were observed in heart rate variability between the two groups. <b>Conclusion:</b> Low-level light-emitting diode light therapy improved sleep quality in shift-work nurses with insomnia and alleviated depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms; however, it did not improve heart rate variability, possibly because of the short intervention duration and the ongoing shift-work schedule. <b>Implications for Nursing Management:</b> Employers could consider providing phototherapy for shift nurses to improve their health. <b>Trial Registration:</b> ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05146596.",Journal of nursing management,2025.0,Yung-Hsuan Liao; Chen-Jei Tai; Jin-Lain Ming; Li-Hwa Lin; Li-Yin Chien,< b > background:</b > shift work schedule cause sleep psychological problem nurse negatively affect health quality life trial examine effect low energy light therapy sleep psychological symptom heart rate variability shift work nurse < b > methods:</b > randomize control trial conduct july 2021 june 2022 inclusion criterion nurse self report insomnia work shift 6 month medical center northern taiwan block randomization assign study participant group experimental < > n</i > = 32 control < > n</i > = 32 portable meridian aura cap equip low level light emit diode provide red near infrared light 660 850 nm 30 min time week 4 week control group receive intervention depression anxiety stress scale-21 insomnia severity index measure psychological symptom sleep problem respectively heart rate variability measure answatch < b > results:</b > significant difference report preintervention score 4 week intervention intervention group score significantly low insomnia 4.3 vs. 12.6 respectively < > p</i > < 0.001 depression 2.5 vs. 7.9 < > p</i > < 0.001 anxiety 3.1 vs. 9.2 < > p</i > < 0.001 stress 5.6 vs. 12 < > p</i > < 0.001 control significant difference observe heart rate variability group < b > conclusion:</b > low level light emit diode light therapy improve sleep quality shift work nurse insomnia alleviated depression anxiety stress symptom improve heart rate variability possibly short intervention duration ongoing shift work schedule < b > implication nursing management:</b > employer consider provide phototherapy shift nurse improve health < b > trial registration:</b > clinicaltrials.gov identifi nct05146596
40557161,Case Report: Therapeutic effect of efgartigimod in refractory anti-GQ1b antibody syndrome coexisting with myasthenia gravis.,"Anti-GQ1b antibody syndrome is a spectrum of autoimmune neurological disorders that includes Miller Fisher syndrome, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) with ophthalmoplegia, Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis, and acute ophthalmoplegia without ataxia. These conditions are characterized by the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies targeting GQ1b gangliosides. The coexistence of anti-GQ1b antibody syndrome and myasthenia gravis (MG) is rare and presents diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. We report the case of an 84-year-old Japanese man with overlapping features of both disorders, describing his clinical course and response to add-on treatment with the neonatal Fc receptor antagonist efgartigimod. He presented with fever and diarrhea, followed by acute limb weakness. He was initially suspected of having had a stroke but was later diagnosed with GBS based on areflexia, anti-ganglioside antibody positivity, and nerve conduction abnormalities. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy was initiated but his condition worsened, leading to respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation. Subsequently, bilateral ptosis and eye movement dysfunction emerged, prompting the consideration of MG. Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies and tensilon test results were positive and high-dose methylprednisolone was administered, resulting in partial improvement. Plasmapheresis was performed, but profound limb weakness and respiratory failure persisted; intravenous efgartigimod was thus introduced. Remarkably, the patient's respiratory function improved within 7 days, leading to ventilator weaning, and his limb weakness showed notable recovery. After a second cycle of efgartigimod, the patient regained speech and independent mobility, allowing transfer to a rehabilitation facility. His case underscores the diagnostic complexity of overlapping anti-GQ1b antibody syndrome and MG, and it highlights the therapeutic potential of efgartigimod in treating refractory cases of overlapping autoimmune neuromuscular syndromes. Given the rapid efficacy of efgartigimod for improving both respiratory and motor functions in this case, it is apparent that efgartigimod can be a valuable therapeutic option in complex neuromuscular autoimmune conditions.",Frontiers in immunology,2025.0,Keiko Watanabe; Seiya Takahashi; Akane Kanda; Takuya Watanabe; Yuki Kakinuma; Satoshi Yano; Ryuta Kinno,anti gq1b antibody syndrome spectrum autoimmune neurological disorder include miller fisher syndrome guillain barré syndrome gbs ophthalmoplegia bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis acute ophthalmoplegia ataxia condition characterize presence immunoglobulin g igg antibodie target gq1b ganglioside coexistence anti gq1b antibody syndrome myasthenia gravis mg rare present diagnostic therapeutic challenge report case 84 year old japanese man overlap feature disorder describe clinical course response add treatment neonatal fc receptor antagonist efgartigimod present fever diarrhea follow acute limb weakness initially suspect having stroke later diagnose gbs base areflexia anti ganglioside antibody positivity nerve conduction abnormality intravenous immunoglobulin therapy initiate condition worsen lead respiratory failure mechanical ventilation subsequently bilateral ptosis eye movement dysfunction emerge prompt consideration mg anti acetylcholine receptor antibody tensilon test result positive high dose methylprednisolone administer result partial improvement plasmapheresis perform profound limb weakness respiratory failure persist intravenous efgartigimod introduce remarkably patient respiratory function improve 7 day lead ventilator weaning limb weakness show notable recovery second cycle efgartigimod patient regain speech independent mobility allow transfer rehabilitation facility case underscore diagnostic complexity overlap anti gq1b antibody syndrome mg highlight therapeutic potential efgartigimod treat refractory case overlap autoimmune neuromuscular syndrome give rapid efficacy efgartigimod improve respiratory motor function case apparent efgartigimod valuable therapeutic option complex neuromuscular autoimmune condition

Traditional autologous nerve grafting, limited by donor shortages and risks of secondary surgeries, has driven tissue-engineered nerve conduits to become a research hotspot. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in immunomodulatory nerve conduits, focusing on the biological properties, degradation mechanisms, and pivotal roles of natural materials (e.g., collagen, chitosan, silk fibroin) and synthetic materials (e.g., poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), polylactic acid (PLA), and polycaprolactone (PCL) in regulating macrophage polarization. The potential of composite materials to synergistically optimize mechanical performance and bioactivity of nerve conduits is also discussed. Furthermore, this review envisions future trends in nerve conduits, including the integration of 4D printing, smart-responsive systems, and personalized designs to overcome current therapeutic limitations.

40557147,B cell-extrinsic and intrinsic factors linked to early immune repletion after anti-CD20 therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis of African ancestry.,"Recent investigations have identified patients of African ancestry (AA) with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), who display more rapid B-cell repopulation after standard semi-annual infusions with an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody for B cell depletion. In this study, we explored the immunologic and genetic factors, with, serum drug monitoring that may contribute to a faster rate of B-cell repletion that follows during recovery from treatment with anti-CD20 antibody. In AA MS patients treated with an anti-CD20 antibody that had early repopulation of peripheral blood B cells, we assessed for extrinsic factors, including the presence of anti-drug antibodies against ocrelizumab, which may contribute to early repletion. We also documented the associated serum drug levels. In addition, we examined for inheritance of intrinsic gene polymorphisms associated with B cell survival and immune function. Our findings identified a subset of AA patients with early B cell repletion after anti-CD20 treatment associated with anti-drug antibodies and an absence of detectable drug. Furthermore, a separate set of AA patients with the early B cell repletion phenotype without anti-drug antibodies had significant over-representation of genetic polymorphisms that map to genes for the B cell survival factor, BAFF, to antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, and to pathways involved in inflammation, leukocyte activation and B cell differentiation. In AA patients with MS, after anti-CD20 antibody treatment we found an unexpected high occurrence of early B cell replenishment. This was associated with the presence of anti-drug antibodies and/or specific genetic polymorphisms. Larger studies are now needed to determine whether these factors may lead to impaired therapeutic benefits of B cell targeted therapy and clinical progression, and these findings may be useful to guide future optimized personalized therapeutic strategies.",Frontiers in immunology,2025.0,Gregg J Silverman; Abhimanyu N Amarnani; Arnaldo A Armini; Angie Kim; Hannah Kopinsky; David Fenyo; Ilya Kister,recent investigation identify patient african ancestry aa multiple sclerosis ms display rapid b cell repopulation standard semi annual infusion anti cd20 monoclonal antibody b cell depletion study explore immunologic genetic factor serum drug monitoring contribute fast rate b cell repletion follow recovery treatment anti cd20 antibody aa ms patient treat anti cd20 antibody early repopulation peripheral blood b cell assess extrinsic factor include presence anti drug antibody ocrelizumab contribute early repletion document associate serum drug level addition examine inheritance intrinsic gene polymorphism associate b cell survival immune function finding identify subset aa patient early b cell repletion anti cd20 treatment associate anti drug antibody absence detectable drug furthermore separate set aa patient early b cell repletion phenotype anti drug antibody significant representation genetic polymorphism map gene b cell survival factor baff antibody dependent cytotoxicity pathway involve inflammation leukocyte activation b cell differentiation aa patient ms anti cd20 antibody treatment find unexpected high occurrence early b cell replenishment associate presence anti drug antibody and/or specific genetic polymorphism large study need determine factor lead impaired therapeutic benefit b cell target therapy clinical progression finding useful guide future optimize personalize therapeutic strategy

40557136,Cross-frequency coupling between low frequency and gamma oscillations altered in cognitive biotype of depression.,"The cognitive biotype of depression has been conceptualized as a distinct subtype characterized by unique distinct neural correlates and specific clinical features. Abnormal neural oscillations related to cognitive dysfunction have been extensively studied, with particular attention given to gamma oscillations due to their crucial role in neurocircuit operations, emotional processing, and cognitive functions. Nevertheless, cross-frequency coupling between low frequency and gamma oscillations in the cognitive biotype of depression have yet to be fully elucidated. The study identified the cognitive biotype in depression by MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). We enrolled 141 depressed patients in remission, including 56 identified as cognitive biotype and 85 as the non-cognitive impairment subgroup. Cross-frequency coupling between low frequency and gamma oscillations were analyzed using specific computational methods based on the data collected by Electroencephalogram (EEG). Furthermore, we did correlation analysis to explore the relationship between cross-frequency coupling of neural oscillations with cognitive function in depression. We found that phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) values decreased in cognitive biotype. Specifically, cross-frequency coupling between theta (Pz: t =-3.512, FDR-corrected p = 0.011), alpha (P3: t =-3.377, FDR-corrected p = 0.009; Pz: t =-3.451, FDR-corrected p = 0.009), beta (P3: t =-3.129, FDR-corrected p = 0.020; Pz: t =-3.333, FDR-corrected p = 0.020) with low gamma decreased at eyes-closed state in cognitive biotype. However, cross-frequency coupling between delta with gamma increased in cognitive biotype (P4: <i>t</i> = 3.314, FDR-corrected p = 0.022) While cross-frequency coupling exhibited no significant differences at eyes-opened state in two subgroups (FDR-corrected p > 0.05). Furthermore, significant correlations between cognitive function and cross-frequency coupling at eyes-closed state were observed. These results indicated that the cross-frequency coupling between low frequency and gamma occurred in the parietal lobe in cognitive biotype of depression. These results advance the understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits and highlight potential biomarkers for precision depression.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2025.0,Hongli Wang; Xiaoning Shi; Chenyang Wang; Yongsheng Qi; Michel Gao; Yingying Zhao,cognitive biotype depression conceptualize distinct subtype characterize unique distinct neural correlate specific clinical feature abnormal neural oscillation relate cognitive dysfunction extensively study particular attention give gamma oscillation crucial role neurocircuit operation emotional processing cognitive function cross frequency coupling low frequency gamma oscillation cognitive biotype depression fully elucidate study identify cognitive biotype depression matrics consensus cognitive battery mccb enrol 141 depressed patient remission include 56 identify cognitive biotype 85 non cognitive impairment subgroup cross frequency coupling low frequency gamma oscillation analyze specific computational method base datum collect electroencephalogram eeg furthermore correlation analysis explore relationship cross frequency coupling neural oscillation cognitive function depression find phase amplitude coupling pac value decrease cognitive biotype specifically cross frequency coupling theta pz t = -3.512 fdr correct p = 0.011 alpha p3 t = -3.377 fdr correct p = 0.009 pz t = -3.451 fdr correct p = 0.009 beta p3 t = -3.129 fdr correct p = 0.020 pz t = -3.333 fdr correct p = 0.020 low gamma decrease eye close state cognitive biotype cross frequency coupling delta gamma increase cognitive biotype p4 < > t</i > = 3.314 fdr correct p = 0.022 cross frequency coupling exhibit significant difference eye open state subgroup fdr correct p > 0.05 furthermore significant correlation cognitive function cross frequency coupling eye close state observe result indicate cross frequency coupling low frequency gamma occur parietal lobe cognitive biotype depression result advance understanding neurophysiological mechanism underlie cognitive deficit highlight potential biomarker precision depression
40557134,Stigmatisation of survivors of political persecution in the GDR: attitudes of healthcare professionals.,"People with mental disorders face various barriers on the road to treatment. People who have experienced injustice of the state apparatus of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in the form of various reprisals are a group that has received insufficient attention in research. Some of them still show long-term psychological and physical consequences that occur more frequently than in the general population, resulting in an increased need for treatment. There are currently no studies on how those affected are perceived by practitioners due to their history and whether they are exposed to stigmatizing attitudes. A vignette-based survey was carried out to identify possible stigmatising attitudes. An independent opinion and survey institute conducted the study in three phases in December 2022, April 2023 and May to August 2024 using an online survey. A total of <i>N</i>=1357 practitioners from the German healthcare system were presented one of four case vignettes. The two vignettes described a person with mental health difficulties who had either experienced an unremarkable socialization in the GDR (A) or had suffered injustice in the GDR (B). In addition to socio-demographic variables, stereotypes, emotional reactions and desire for social distance towards the person described were recorded. Age and sex as well as subjective knowledge about the GDR, the occupational group and the working environment influence the intensity of emotional reactions as well as the desire for social distance and the extent of negative stereotypical attitudes. The presentation of a case vignette that deals with an experience of SED injustice favours a decrease in positive and an increase in negative stereotypes. The explanatory power of the regression models is predominantly in the medium range (from 9.7 till 35.3%). Even more than three decades after the reunification of Germany, people with mental health problems and an experience of SED injustice in the GDR still experience stigmatizing attitudes on the part of those treating them.

40557109,Uncovering the truth about cat-scratch disease.,"Cat-scratch disease (CSD) is a systemic infection caused by the facultative, rod-shaped, nonmotile, Gram-negative, intracellular zoonotic bacillus <i>Bartonella henselae</i>. The bacteria responsible for CSD were not discovered until decades after the condition was first characterized in 1931. The prevalence of CSD is more common in warm, humid areas and is typically seasonal, peaking in the fall and winter. The pathogenesis of CSD starts when a tiny wound from an infected cat's bite or scratch allows the bacteria <i>B. henselae</i> to enter the human body. The innate immune system, which includes neutrophils and macrophages, is activated as an initial reaction. Histological examination of skin lesions and lymph nodes in immunocompetent people early in the clinical phase of CSD revealed lymphoid hyperplasia and arteriolar proliferation. The best initial test for CSD is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or an indirect fluorescence assay. Bacteremia is typically asymptomatic in cats that are naturally infected with <i>B. henselae</i>. In humans, <i>B. henselae</i> can spread and infect the liver, spleen, eyes, and central nervous system in certain people. Cat fleas (<i>Ctenocephalides felis</i>) are the main vectors of <i>B. henselae</i> transmission. The zoonotic nature of CSD makes it a public health concern because it can be transmitted from cats to people. Treatment strategies for <i>Bartonella</i> infections differ according to the patient's immunological status and clinical signs. The research on the effectiveness of antibiotics in vitro and in vivo differs significantly.

40557096,"Botulism type C outbreak in free-ranging wild birds in a public urban park in Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo state, Brazil.","Botulism is a neurological disease caused by the ingestion of the toxin produced by <i>Clostridium botulinum</i>. This bacterium is globally distributed, infects mainly mammals and birds, and is present in both the intestinal microbiota and the environment. The most frequently observed clinical manifestation is flaccid paralysis of the skeletal muscles, which can rapidly progress to death due to cardiorespiratory failure. Diagnosis is performed through clinical, environmental, and laboratory findings, mainly by mouse bioassay seroneutralization, which serves as the gold standard. During the seasonal period, approximately 30-60 dead or sick animals were found in an urban park in Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil, between late 2020 and 2021. However, only four wild ducks (<i>Cairina moschata</i>) and one great egret (<i>Ardea alba</i>) were evaluated. All five animals presented with neurological signs of limb paralysis, dyspnea, and neck flaccidity and were unable to fly. After clinical evaluation, the animals were euthanized, and necropsies were performed. Although we observed discrete hemorrhagic enteritis in the three evaluated ducks, no other relevant lesions were found. Samples were sent to the laboratory, where type <i>C botulinum</i> toxin was detected. The presence of botulism in urban areas, especially in leisure areas, raises public health concerns.

40557085,First detection of West Nile virus seropositivity in horses in southern Iraq.,"West Nile virus (WNV) circulates between birds and mosquitoes, with horses and humans as incidental dead-end hosts. Despite documented cases in neighboring countries and human cases in southern Iraq, no previous studies have investigated WNV in Iraqi horses. To determine the seroprevalence of WNV in horses from three southern Iraqi governorates (Thi-Qar, Misan, and Basrah) between March and June 2024. Blood samples were collected from 236 horses regardless of age, sex, or health status. Serum samples were analyzed using commercial competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits to detect specific anti-Pr E IgG and IgM antibodies.

40557036,Emotional stress during the COVID-19 lockdown: how negative X/Twitter posts correlated with changes in the brain's fear network.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected mental health, with lockdown periods particularly exacerbating negative emotions such as fear, sadness, and uncertainty. This study examines brain metabolic changes associated with the psychological context of the first French COVID-19 lockdown in vulnerable individuals. As a proxy measure of the psychological context, we used a composite negative-emotion score derived from an open-source X/Twitter dataset (""The First French COVID-19 Lockdown Twitter Dataset""), designed to capture public sentiment over the 55-day lockdown. This score was day-by-day correlated with whole-brain voxel-based [18F]FDG PET imaging in 95 patients with neurological conditions, using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) (<i>p</i>-voxel < 0.001, <i>k</i> > 108). A significant negative correlation was found between daily negative-emotion scores and metabolism in the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), key regions of the brain's fear circuit. Inter-regional correlation analysis (IRCA) of metabolic connectivity from the right vmPFC/ACC further revealed a right limbic-dominant network including the amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, and basal ganglia. These findings highlight the sensitivity of the right vmPFC/ACC to societal emotional stressors, suggesting a potential cerebral substrate for the increase in psychological and psychiatric disorders observed during the pandemic. Further research is needed to validate these results in larger populations and to explore their longitudinal implications, to better understand the neurological impact of collective stress.",Frontiers in nuclear medicine,2025.0,Eric Guedj; Jacques-Yves Campion; Tatiana Horowitz; Fanny Barthélémy; Stéphanie Khalfa; Wissam El-Hage,covid-19 pandemic profoundly affect mental health lockdown period particularly exacerbate negative emotion fear sadness uncertainty study examine brain metabolic change associate psychological context french covid-19 lockdown vulnerable individual proxy measure psychological context composite negative emotion score derive open source x twitter dataset french covid-19 lockdown twitter dataset design capture public sentiment 55 day lockdown score day day correlate brain voxel base 18f]fdg pet imaging 95 patient neurological condition statistical parametric mapping spm < > p</i>-voxel < 0.001 < > k</i > > 108 significant negative correlation find daily negative emotion score metabolism right ventromedial prefrontal cortex vmpfc anterior cingulate cortex acc key region brain fear circuit inter regional correlation analysis irca metabolic connectivity right vmpfc acc reveal right limbic dominant network include amygdala hippocampus thalamus basal ganglia finding highlight sensitivity right vmpfc acc societal emotional stressor suggest potential cerebral substrate increase psychological psychiatric disorder observe pandemic research need validate result large population explore longitudinal implication well understand neurological impact collective stress
40557025,"Unmasking Pulmonary Nocardiosis in an Asthmatic Host Presenting With Chronic Cough, Pulmonary Nodularity, and Ground-Glass Opacities.","A 53-year-old man was evaluated in the pulmonary clinic for ongoing asthma symptoms. Despite optimized treatment, he continued to experience a chronic productive cough. He was otherwise physically active, a lifelong non-smoker with no known occupational or environmental exposures. Pulmonary function tests demonstrated normal diffusing capacity and mild airflow obstruction. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed basilar bronchiectasis, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, scattered nodules, and progressive ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in the bilateral lower lobes. Immunoglobulin (Ig) testing showed an isolated IgG3 deficiency, while other Ig subclasses were within normal limits. Additional laboratory workup, including alpha-1 antitrypsin levels, antinuclear antibody, and HIV serologies, was unremarkable. Bronchoscopy was performed, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures grew pan-sensitive <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, prompting a course of levofloxacin. Despite an initial negative acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain, cultures later identified <i>Nocardia nova</i>. Given this diagnosis, a head CT was obtained to assess for central nervous system involvement, which was negative. The patient was initially started on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole but developed an adverse reaction, necessitating a switch to an extended course of intravenous ceftriaxone, which was later changed to clarithromycin based on susceptibility testing. A repeat chest CT demonstrated resolution of nodularity, GGOs, and lymphadenopathy. His symptoms fully resolved, with no recurrence of cough or asthma-like exacerbations. Although <i>Nocardia</i> infections are commonly associated with immunosuppression, typically occurring in patients with solid organ or hematopoietic cell transplants, chronic glucocorticoid use, malignancy, or HIV with low CD4 counts, approximately one-third of cases are reported in immunocompetent individuals. While cellular immunocompromise is a well-established risk factor, isolated IgG3 deficiency is not. Asthma, particularly when treated with corticosteroids or accompanied by structural lung disease, is also recognized as a key predisposing respiratory condition. Pulmonary involvement is most frequent, though dissemination to the central nervous system and skin can also occur. This case underscores the need to consider pulmonary nocardiosis even in patients without an overtly immunocompromised state who present with unexplained respiratory symptoms.

40557018,Understanding the Association Between Mental Health and Hair Loss.,"This literature review aims to analyze the association between mental health disorders and various types of hair loss, including telogen effluvium, androgenetic alopecia, alopecia areata, and compulsive disorders such as trichotillomania. A comprehensive review of recent studies was conducted to explore the bidirectional relationship between psychiatric conditions and hair loss, with emphasis on neurobiological mechanisms and psychosocial consequences. Findings show that psychiatric disorders can contribute to or exacerbate hair loss, while hair loss may lead to psychological symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and body dysmorphic disorder. Proposed mechanisms include immune dysfunction, neuroendocrine imbalance, microinflammation, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) depletion, gut-brain-skin axis dysregulation, and medication-induced disruptions in hair cycling. Furthermore, individuals with somatic symptom disorder may report hair loss in the absence of clinical findings, complicating diagnosis and care.

40557002,Association Between Sleep-Related Leg Movements and Diabetes Prevalence: A Cohort Study From the United States.,"Background Sleep is integral to cardiometabolic health. While there is emerging evidence linking sleep-related leg movements (SRLM) to diabetes mellitus (DM), the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigates the association between SRLM and DM prevalence in a national population-based cohort study in the United States (US), considering potential mediators like short sleep duration and inflammation and examining variations across age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Methods We analyzed data from 9,191 adults (aged ≥18 years) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2008. We assessed the frequency of SRLM (leg jerks and leg cramps) and diabetes prevalence (self-reported diagnosis, diabetes medication use, or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 6.5%). Weighted logistic regression models were used to evaluate the associations, adjusting for demographic and clinical-related confounders. Mediation analyses were conducted to explore the roles of short sleep duration and inflammation (C-reactive protein levels). Results The study revealed that 1,278 (14%) participants have DM. SRLM was associated with a 72% increase in the odds of diabetes (OR=1.72, 95% CI: 1.06-2.81). The association is more pronounced in non-Hispanic White individuals, females, and adults aged 18-65. Short sleep duration and inflammation mediated 5.0% and 3.9% of this association, respectively. Conclusions SRLM is independently and linearly associated with increased prevalence of diabetes in a representative sample of the US adult population.

40556954,Activation Likelihood Estimation Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy on Brain Activation in the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety Disorders.,"<b>Background:</b> Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) stands as a highly efficacious psychological treatment for both anxiety and depressive disorders. Nonetheless, scholarly debates persist regarding the specificities of brain area activation during CBT treatment for these disorders. <b>Methodology:</b> Utilizing activation likelihood estimation (ALE) analysis, this study aims to discern the neurobiological similarities and disparities between CBT's effects on anxiety and depressive disorders by examining functional brain areas. <b>Results:</b> A total of 22 articles, encompassing 443 patients, were included in the meta-analysis. Our results show that in the resting state, patients with depression treated with CBT resulted in increased activation of the right and left ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), left parahippocampal gyrus (PG), right subgyral, left inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), and right inferior occipital gyrus (IOG), whereas patients with anxiety disorders had increased activation of the right and left superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and decreased activation of the caudate after treatment. In the task state, increased activation of the right PG, right orbital frontal lobe, and right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) was mainly observed after treatment in patients with anxiety disorders, and the left lentiform nucleus (LN), left dorsal entorhinal cortex, and right caudate activation were decreased. For depressive disorders, no consistent activation patterns emerged in the task state, likely due to limited studies or heterogeneity in task paradigms across included studies. <b>Conclusion:</b> CBT's efficacy relies on both shared (e.g., vACC-mediated emotion regulation and cognitive control) and distinct neural mechanisms (fear-circuit modulation in anxiety vs. memory-network enhancement in depression), informing biomarker-driven treatment personalization.",Depression and anxiety,2025.0,Junjie Ren; Lijun Ma; Wanxin Wu; Juan Qiu; Zhuo Zhang; Yuxi Hong; Zushen Wang; Xinyu Hou; Jia Jin; Weixuan Hu; Yanran Wu; Xiaowei Chen; Jinyi Luo; Chuan Fan; Kai Wang; Xiaoming Li,< b > background:</b > cognitive behavioral therapy cbt stand highly efficacious psychological treatment anxiety depressive disorder nonetheless scholarly debate persist specificity brain area activation cbt treatment disorder < b > methodology:</b > utilize activation likelihood estimation ale analysis study aim discern neurobiological similarity disparity cbt effect anxiety depressive disorder examine functional brain area < b > results:</b > total 22 article encompass 443 patient include meta analysis result resting state patient depression treat cbt result increase activation right leave ventral anterior cingulate cortex vacc leave parahippocampal gyrus pg right subgyral leave inferior temporal gyrus itg right inferior occipital gyrus iog patient anxiety disorder increase activation right leave superior frontal gyrus sfg decrease activation caudate treatment task state increase activation right pg right orbital frontal lobe right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex dacc mainly observe treatment patient anxiety disorder left lentiform nucleus ln leave dorsal entorhinal cortex right caudate activation decrease depressive disorder consistent activation pattern emerge task state likely limited study heterogeneity task paradigms include study < b > conclusion:</b > cbt efficacy rely share e.g. vacc mediate emotion regulation cognitive control distinct neural mechanism fear circuit modulation anxiety vs. memory network enhancement depression inform biomarker drive treatment personalization
40556907,Association between household solid fuel use and dual sensory impairment in a Chinese population: a retrospective cohort study.,"Dual sensory impairment (DSI) is more harmful than a single visual impairment or hearing impairment. We aimed to explore the relationship between household fuel use and the risk of DSI in the middle-aged and older adult Chinese population. Data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) 2015 of 8,083 participants aged ≥45 years were used, followed up to 2018. Household fuels include heating fuels and cooking fuels. Participants were divided into four groups based on the type of household fuel use at baseline (2015) and during follow-up (2018) (baseline and follow-up): clean fuels and clean fuels, clean fuels and solid fuels, solid fuels and clean fuels, and solid fuels and solid fuels. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association between household fuel use and the risk of DSI, and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was utilized to evaluate the association. Of these 8,083 participants, 886 (10.96%) had hearing impairment, 2,361 (29.21%) had visual impairment, and 505 (6.25%) had DSI. The use of solid fuels at baseline (OR = 1.23, 95%CI: 1.02-1.49) was associated with a higher risk of DSI compared to the use of clean fuels.

40556905,Prevalence and antibiotic resistance of pathogens isolated from neurosurgical patients with postoperative central nervous system infections in a tertiary hospital in North China.,"Postoperative central nervous system infection (PCNSI) is a serious complication following neurosurgery. Effective clinical management of PCNSI requires prompt antibiotic administration based on the identification of the causative pathogens and antibiotic resistance. This study aimed to investigate the causative pathogens of PCNSI and their antibiotic resistance profiles, which could help clinicians initiate appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy. The distribution and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens in patients with PCNSI from January 2014 to December 2023 were analyzed retrospectively. Cerebrospinal fluid samples were aseptically collected and subjected to standard microbiological methods for bacterial isolation and identification. Antibiotic sensitivity testing was performed via the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion agar method. A total of 396 patients were diagnosed with PCNSI, and 385 pathogens were identified from these patients. The percentages of Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi were 56.10, 41.30, and 2.60%, respectively. The predominant pathogens among the Gram-positive bacteria were coagulase-negative staphylococci (29.09%), whereas <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (14.29%) was the most common Gram-negative bacterium. Compared with those from 2014 to 2018, the proportions of <i>Enterococcus</i> and <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> increased markedly from 2019 to 2023. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that all Gram-positive bacteria had 100% sensitivity to vancomycin and linezolid, whereas imipenem, meropenem, and amikacin were most effective against Gram-negative bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria, especially coagulase-negative staphylococci, were the predominant pathogens causing PCNSI. Furthermore, several Gram-negative species, especially <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> and <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, showed concerning trends of increasing resistance to common antibiotics. <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> showed an increasing proportion of infections, posing a clinical challenge due to the limited number of effective antibiotics.",Frontiers in public health,2025.0,Fan Yang; Jingnan Chen; Mengjie Zhao; Hejun Zhao; Bin Yang; Xuequan Feng,postoperative central nervous system infection pcnsi complication follow neurosurgery effective clinical management pcnsi require prompt antibiotic administration base identification causative pathogen antibiotic resistance study aim investigate causative pathogen pcnsi antibiotic resistance profile help clinician initiate appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy distribution antimicrobial resistance pathogen patient pcnsi january 2014 december 2023 analyze retrospectively cerebrospinal fluid sample aseptically collect subject standard microbiological method bacterial isolation identification antibiotic sensitivity testing perform kirby bauer disk diffusion agar method total 396 patient diagnose pcnsi 385 pathogen identify patient percentage gram positive bacteria gram negative bacteria fungus 56.10 41.30 2.60 respectively predominant pathogen gram positive bacteria coagulase negative staphylococci 29.09 < > acinetobacter baumannii</i > 14.29 common gram negative bacterium compare 2014 2018 proportion < > enterococcus</i > < > acinetobacter baumannii</i > increase markedly 2019 2023 antimicrobial susceptibility testing reveal gram positive bacteria 100 sensitivity vancomycin linezolid imipenem meropenem amikacin effective gram negative bacteria gram positive bacteria especially coagulase negative staphylococci predominant pathogen cause pcnsi furthermore gram negative specie especially < > klebsiella pneumoniae</i > < > acinetobacter baumannii</i > show concern trend increase resistance common antibiotic < > acinetobacter baumannii</i > show increase proportion infection pose clinical challenge limited number effective antibiotic
40556904,"The current status, trends, and challenges of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias in Asia (1990-2036).","With global aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias have emerged as significant health threats to the older adults, garnering considerable attention due to their impact on public health. Despite the substantial burden of dementia in Asia, targeted research remains limited. This study aims to assess the current burden, future trends, risk factors, and inequalities in Asia. The GBD 2021 study was utilized to evaluate the numbers and age-standardized rates (ASRs) of prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of AD and other dementias from 1990 to 2021. Joinpoint regression analysis was performed to assess the trends during this period, while the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was employed to predict future trends. Additionally, the relationship between disease burden and sociodemographic index (SDI) was also analyzed. In 2021, Asia experienced a 250.44% increase in prevalent cases, a 297.34% rise in mortality, and a 249.54% surge in DALYs for AD and other dementias compared to 1990. Meanwhile, the age-standardized prevalence rate, age-standardized mortality rate, and age-standardized DALY rate also exhibited varying degrees of rise from 1990 to 2021. Demographically, the disease burden was higher in women and those aged 65 and above. Regionally, the burden was highest in East Asia and relatively low in South and Central Asia. Nationally, China, India, Japan, and Indonesia reported the most cases. Over the next 15 years, the age-standardized prevalence rate in Asia is expected to peak in 2028 before declining, while the age-standardized mortality rate is anticipated to keep rising. An overall ""V"" shaped association was found between sociodemographic index (SDI) and the age-standardized DALY rate in Asia. Only smoking, high fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and high BMI were identified as causal risk factors within the GBD framework. The burden of AD and other dementias in Asia has significantly increased over the past three decades and is expected to persistently impact Asian populations, particularly in developing countries experiencing rapid demographic shifts.

40556901,"A pilot short-term study of feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of 3-stage 8-session 4-week group therapy-based narrative intervention in 17 improved hospitalized female schizophrenia patients in southern China.","Self-stigma has been consistently cited as a major obstacle to recovery-related outcomes among patients with schizophrenia. To examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the group-based narrative intervention for improving self-stigma, self-esteem and psychological capital in hospitalized patients with schizophrenia, a case-series study was conducted from March to May 2023 in a closed psychiatric ward of a specialized hospital in mainland China. Feasibility was assessed by examining rates of recruitment, retention, and protocol adherence. Acceptability was assessed through the therapist's and patients' feedback about the intervention. Changes in the levels of self-stigma, self-esteem, and psychological capital perceived by patients were measured before and after 4 weeks of intervention. Rates of enrolment (85%) and completion of intervention sessions and study procedures (100%) were excellent, demonstrating high rates of feasibility among these patients in the local setting.

40556825,Evaluating the antioxidant-mediated neuroprotection of hamamelitannin against H₂O₂-induced oxidative damage.,"Excessive generation of free radicals disrupts redox equilibrium, inducing oxidative stress. Dementia and other related neurodegenerative illnesses are important ailments associated with oxidative stress. Antioxidant treatment proves effective in reducing oxidative stress and associated neurodegeneration. This study examined the therapeutic potential of Hamamelitannin, a hydrolyzable tannin derived from the barks of <i>Hamamelis virginiana</i> L., against the hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress. Hamamelitannin (10-50 μM) had no effects on the hatching, heart rates, and also no lethal malformations were observed. Hammamelitannin exposure significantly (p < 0.05) improved the alterations in swimming behavior and the cognitive impairment caused by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in a concentration-dependent manner from 10 to 50 μM. It also showed significant restoration of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GPx, GST, and GSH), and acetylcholinesterase activity was observed in larvae exposed to hydrogen peroxide compared to the control. Hamamelitannin lowered the MDA and nitric oxide levels in group treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The Cell death and intracellular ROS levels were assessed using acridine orange and dichlorofluorescein diacetate staining methods. Hamamelitannin significantly (p < 0.05) reduced apoptosis and ROS levels caused by hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, Hamamelitannin upregulated the expression of antioxidant enzyme genes, indicating its potential in combating oxidative stress.

40556824,Exploring the spectrum of heroin-induced changes in the rat brain.,"The primary objective of this study was to investigate the effects of prolonged heroin exposure on adult male rats. Our findings demonstrate that this intervention induces deficits in memory, synaptic plasticity, emotional regulation, and motor function. These impairments appear to be associated with reduced levels of BDNF, increased expression of REST/NRSF, and elevated astrocyte activity within the hippocampus. We employed a multimodal approach to assess the impact of heroin in 24 adult male rats following 2 weeks of daily injections. Behavioral assessments were conducted to evaluate memory and anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors, followed by tests of neuromuscular and locomotor function. Molecular and histological analyses were subsequently performed to characterize heroin-induced alterations in the brain. Heroin-treated rats showed impaired performance in cognitive tasks, evidenced by reduced scores in the Y-maze and shuttle box tests. Furthermore, heroin exposure negatively affected behavioral scores in the open field test, tail suspension test, and elevated plus maze. Electromyography (EMG) revealed increased latency, indicating disruptions in neuromuscular activity. Indicators of long-term potentiation (LTP), including population spike amplitude, and field EPSP slope, were significantly reduced following heroin administration. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed marked astrogliosis and alterations in BDNF and REST expression in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Additionally, heroin disrupted the spatial organization of neurons. In conclusion, these results suggest that heroin exposure induces structural and functional neuronal changes, likely mediated by neuroinflammation and dysregulated neurotrophic signaling, which may underlie the observed cognitive impairments.",3 Biotech,2025.0,Proushat Shirvani; Paniz Shirvani; Seyed Mohammadmisagh Moteshakereh; Zahrasadat Lajevardi; Seyedeh Naghmeh Nourirad; Nahal Babaeian Amini; Zahra Niakan; Siavash Parvardeh; Amir-Hossein Bayat; Ramtin Hajibeygi; Kimia Vakili; Fetemeh Navaei; Mohammad Mahdi Mehrabi; Sina Dolatshahi; Hossein Salehi Omran; Mojtaba Sani; Meysam Hassani Moghaddam; Abbas Aliaghaei,primary objective study investigate effect prolonged heroin exposure adult male rat finding demonstrate intervention induce deficit memory synaptic plasticity emotional regulation motor function impairment appear associate reduced level bdnf increase expression rest nrsf elevated astrocyte activity hippocampus employ multimodal approach assess impact heroin 24 adult male rat follow 2 week daily injection behavioral assessment conduct evaluate memory anxiety like depression like behavior follow test neuromuscular locomotor function molecular histological analysis subsequently perform characterize heroin induce alteration brain heroin treat rat show impaired performance cognitive task evidence reduce score y maze shuttle box test furthermore heroin exposure negatively affect behavioral score open field test tail suspension test elevated plus maze electromyography emg reveal increase latency indicate disruption neuromuscular activity indicator long term potentiation ltp include population spike amplitude field epsp slope significantly reduce follow heroin administration immunohistochemical analysis reveal marked astrogliosis alteration bdnf rest expression ca1 region hippocampus additionally heroin disrupt spatial organization neuron conclusion result suggest heroin exposure induce structural functional neuronal change likely mediate neuroinflammation dysregulate neurotrophic signaling underlie observe cognitive impairment
40556758,The role of the tryptophan metabolites in gut microbiota-brain axis and potential treatments: a focus on ischemic stroke.,"Gut microbiota disturbances can elevate the risk of stroke by contributing to cerebrovascular events. Particularly, the gut tryptophan (TRP) metabolite is an essential mediator of the gut-brain axis. This review highlights the role of TRP metabolism in stroke, the influence of intestinal microbiomes on stroke pathology via TRP metabolism, and the gut-brain axis interactions. Recent studies indicate that various bioactive molecules produced via TRP metabolism can regulate various neurological functions and interrupt stroke pathophysiology. Moreover, the relationship between gut TRP metabolism and stroke development has been verified. TRP metabolism involves three pathways: kynurenine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and indole, which potentially regulate post-stroke, may function as aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonists to modify neuronal excitotoxicity, and offer crucial targets for stroke treatment. This suggests that modulating TRP metabolite levels through various methods can enhance the prognosis of central nervous system diseases and restore microbiota-gut-brain axis functions.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2025.0,Na Qin; Xiaodi Xie; Rong Deng; Shiman Gao; Ting Zhu,gut microbiota disturbance elevate risk stroke contribute cerebrovascular event particularly gut tryptophan trp metabolite essential mediator gut brain axis review highlight role trp metabolism stroke influence intestinal microbiome stroke pathology trp metabolism gut brain axis interaction recent study indicate bioactive molecule produce trp metabolism regulate neurological function interrupt stroke pathophysiology relationship gut trp metabolism stroke development verify trp metabolism involve pathway kynurenine 5 hydroxytryptamine indole potentially regulate post stroke function aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist modify neuronal excitotoxicity offer crucial target stroke treatment suggest modulate trp metabolite level method enhance prognosis central nervous system disease restore microbiota gut brain axis function
40556745,Human Muscle-Derived Vascular Stem Cells Can Support Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells In Vitro.,"<b>Background:</b> The normal hematopoiesis of the body depends on the interaction between hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that support the growth and development of hematopoietic cells. However, the separation of MSCs from bone marrow is somewhat limited, and the researchers have turned their attention to stromal cells outside the bone marrow. As the largest organ of human body, skeletal muscle tissue stores a variety of muscle-derived vascular stem/progenitor cells, including muscle-derived pericytes/perivascular cells (MD-PCs) and skeletal muscle derived myoendothelial cells (MECs). Studies have shown that MD-PCs and MECs are similar to bone morrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs), which express the surface markers of MSCs and have the potential of multidirectional differentiation. However, very few researches have been done on whether MD-PCs and MECs, like MSCs, can support HSPCs expansion/proliferation, differentiation and possible hematopoietic regulation mechanisms, so the hematopoietic support of these cells remains to be studied. <b>Objective:</b> To identify the biological characteristics of CD146<sup>+</sup> PCs and MECs isolated from human skeletal muscle and to study their supporting effect on umbilical cord blood (UCB) CD34<sup>+</sup> cells in vitro. <b>Methods:</b> Human skeletal muscle-derived CD146<sup>+</sup> PCs and MECs were isolated and purified by multiparameter flow cytometry and their biological characteristics were identified. The coculture system for CD34<sup>+</sup> cells with CD146<sup>+</sup> PCs and MECs as trophoblastic layer, and BM-MSCs as positive control, was established in vitro, respectively. The main outcome measures, including the number and immunophenotype of the cells, the colony formation ability, the expression levels of cytokines were analyzed and compared at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after coculture. <b>Results:</b> CD146<sup>+</sup> PCs and MECs were isolated by multiparameter flow cytometry and their purity of was 92.55% ± 0.55% and 96.60% ± 1.14% (<i>n</i> = 18), respectively. Both of the cells could be differentiated into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and myocytes. Compared with the positive control group of BM-MSCs, the experimental group of CD146<sup>+</sup> PCs and MECs showed no significant differences in cell number, colony formation ability and immunophenotype (CD45<sup>+</sup>, CD34<sup>+</sup> CD33<sup>-</sup>, CD14<sup>+</sup>, and CD10<sup>+</sup>/CD19<sup>+</sup>; <i>p</i>  > 0.05, <i>n</i> = 5), separately. The expression levels of cytokines in the culture supernatants of CD146<sup>+</sup> PCs group, MECs group, and BM-MSCs group were measured by ELISA. The expression levels of TPO, IFN-γ, HGF, MCSF, and SCF cytokines were different among CD146<sup>+</sup> PCs, MECs, and human BM-MSCs (<i>p</i> < 0.05, <i>n</i> = 3). Due to the no nourishing feeder layer in culture system, the number of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells decreased significantly in the 1st week and no cells survived in the 2nd week.

40556715,Feasibility and acceptability of community-based psychosocial interventions delivered by nonspecialists for perinatal common mental disorders: A systematic review using an implementation science framework.,"Task sharing is endorsed as one of the strategies to address the treatment gap in common perinatal mental health conditions. There is a well-established body of evidence on the effectiveness of psychological interventions delivered by nonspecialist health workers (NSHWs); however, there is a dearth of evidence documenting factors determining the feasibility, acceptability and sustainability of integrating and implementing these interventions. This systematic review aims to synthesize the implementation outcomes and implementation process of NSHWs-delivered psychological interventions for the management of perinatal depression and anxiety using Proctor's implementation science framework outlining eight constructs: feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, adoption, cost, fidelity, penetration and sustainability. We searched PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Center Register of Controlled Trials for studies published in English and between 2000 and 2022 using search terms under five broad categories: (a) ""perinatal""; (b) ""common mental disorders""; (c) ""psychological interventions""; (d) ""nonspecialist"" and (e) ""implementation outcomes."" Secondary publications were also hand-searched for data extraction. Two authors independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles. Data for included articles were extracted using a standard data extraction sheet. A narrative synthesis of qualitative evidence was conducted. Initial searches identified 885 articles of which full text of 128 articles were screened for eligibility, with 56 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Out of the eight constructs of Proctor's framework, ""feasibility,"" ""acceptability,"" ""appropriateness"" and ""fidelity"" were the most evaluated outcomes. None of the studies reported ""penetration"" and very few reported ""sustainability,"" ""adoption"" or ""cost."" None of the studies used any implementation science framework for the study evaluation. Despite the well-established evidence on the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for perinatal depression and anxiety by NSHWs, these interventions are rarely adopted into the health system. More studies applying systems thinking are needed to explore facilitators, barriers and mechanisms for integrating interventions in the health system. Using implementation science frameworks to design, plan, execute and evaluate psychosocial interventions by NSHWs can address this gap in evidence.","Global mental health (Cambridge, England)",2025.0,Prasansa Subba; Pragya Shrestha; Atif Rahman; Nagendra Luitel; Ahmed Waqas; Siham Sikander,task sharing endorse strategy address treatment gap common perinatal mental health condition establish body evidence effectiveness psychological intervention deliver nonspecialist health worker nshw dearth evidence document factor determine feasibility acceptability sustainability integrate implement intervention systematic review aim synthesize implementation outcome implementation process nshw deliver psychological intervention management perinatal depression anxiety proctor implementation science framework outline construct feasibility acceptability appropriateness adoption cost fidelity penetration sustainability search pubmed web science cochrane center register controlled trials study publish english 2000 2022 search term broad category perinatal b common mental disorder c psychological intervention d nonspecialist e implementation outcome secondary publication hand search datum extraction author independently review abstract text article datum include article extract standard data extraction sheet narrative synthesis qualitative evidence conduct initial search identify 885 article text 128 article screen eligibility 56 study meet inclusion criterion construct proctor framework feasibility acceptability appropriateness fidelity evaluated outcome study report penetration report sustainability adoption cost study implementation science framework study evaluation despite establish evidence effectiveness psychosocial intervention perinatal depression anxiety nshw intervention rarely adopt health system study apply system thinking need explore facilitator barrier mechanism integrate intervention health system implementation science framework design plan execute evaluate psychosocial intervention nshw address gap evidence
40556661,A splice-switching antisense oligonucleotide targeting APP reduces accumulation of α-synuclein in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by abnormal protein aggregation, with amyloid beta (Aβ) and α-synuclein (α-syn) as key pathological markers. Increasing evidence highlights a pathological interplay between Aβ and α-syn, exacerbating neurodegeneration in both AD and PD. In this study, we evaluated the effects of reducing amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing on α-syn pathology using a splice-switching oligonucleotide (SSO) targeting APP exon 15 in Thy1-α-syn transgenic (α-syn-tg) mice. α-syn-tg mice received systemic APP SSO treatment. Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting assessed α-syn, phosphorylated α-syn (P-Syn), and APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) in the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus. Neuronal integrity in different brain regions were examined, and behavioral assessments evaluated cognitive and motor functions. APP SSO treatment significantly reduced α-syn and P-Syn in the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus while also reversing neuronal loss in the hippocampal CA3 region. Interestingly, α-syn-tg mice exhibited elevated levels of alternative APP CTFs, which were reduced by APP SSO treatment, implicating APP processing dysregulation in α-syn pathology. Although behavioral assessments revealed no significant impairments or improvements in female α-syn-tg mice. Our findings demonstrate that targeting APP reduces α-syn pathology and rescues neuronal loss, supporting the therapeutic potential of APP modulation in synucleinopathies. While no behavioral changes were observed in transgenic mice, further research exploring different models and conditions may provide additional insights into the full range of therapeutic benefits. Future studies should optimize delivery methods and explore combination therapies to enhance outcomes in neurodegenerative diseases with overlapping proteinopathies. APP-targeting SSO reduces α-syn and P-Syn in α-syn-tg mice.APP SSO lowers APP CTFs, linking APP processing to α-syn pathology.Neuronal loss in the hippocampal CA3 region is restored following APP SSO treatment.Behavioral assessments show no significant changes in female α-syn-tg mice.Findings support APP modulation as a potential strategy for synucleinopathies.","Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N.

40556615,Protein Associations With Alcohol Consumption and Genetic Risk for Alcohol-Related Sociomedical Conditions.,"Studies investigating proteomic associations with alcohol consumption and the genetic links of these proteins to alcohol-related traits are scarce. The aims of our study were (1) to identify proteins associated with alcohol consumption and (2) to investigate the molecular pathways and genetics linking the identified proteins to alcohol consumption and related sociomedical conditions. We generated proteomic and genotypic data from blood samples of 387 Finnish twins (age range: 56-70) and calculated polygenic risk scores (PRSs) of eight alcohol-related traits: obesity, alcohol dependence, number of drinks per week, number of cigarettes per day, major depressive disorders (MDDs), schizophrenia, externalising behaviour and educational attainment. We identified 20 (out of 2321) proteins associated with alcohol consumption, expressed as log ethanol grams per month, after Bonferroni correction and adjustment for BMI, sex and age. Within-pair analyses in monozygotic twin pairs showed that some of the identified associations persisted after accounting for genetic confounding. While only the PRS representing genetic risk for the number of alcoholic drinks per week was associated with alcohol consumption, several proteins were associated with PRSs, in particular the PRS of MDD. All identified proteins were significantly replicated in the UK Biobank, and pathway analysis suggested their collective connection to alcohol consumption might be explained by oxidative stress and cell damage. In conclusion, we identified several alcohol-associated plasma proteins whose levels are also linked to genetic risk for mental illness and substance use.

40556544,Saturated Fatty Acids and White Matter Microstructure in Individuals With At-risk Mental State.,"Excessive saturated or deficient unsaturated fatty acids and white matter microstructural abnormalities are observed before the psychosis onset. Whereas fatty acids variations are implicated in white matter pathology, conventional Diffusion Tensor Imaging has limitations in disentangling their biological relevance. Free-water imaging provides improved biological specificity to white matter microstructure, such as fractional volume of free-water (FW) and tissue-specific fractional anisotropy (FAt). This study aims to investigate the associations between altered proportion of saturated or unsaturated fatty acids and free-water imaging parameters in prodromal psychosis. We applied free-water imaging and Tract-Based Spatial Statistics to compare FAt and FW between 78 individuals with at-risk mental state (ARMS) and 129 healthy controls. In a subsample with available blood samples (n = 53 and n = 42, respectively), relationships between fatty acid composition of erythrocyte membrane and FAt or FW were examined alongside clinical and cognitive variables. Compared to the controls, individuals with ARMS exhibited higher relative concentrations of saturated fatty acids as well as lower FAt and higher FW in multiple association and projection fibers. In the ARMS group, elevated proportion of saturated fatty acids was associated with lower FAt and with positive symptoms and impaired verbal fluency. The association of saturated fatty acids with FAt in ARMS suggests that fatty acids may influence disrupted white matter microstructure, such as impaired myelin maintenance prior to psychosis onset.

40556526,Evaluation of the effects of tideglusib and calcium sulfate on the healing of experimental bone defects in rabbits.,"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of tideglusib and bone graft mixture on bone healing. Tideglusib is a drug used in the treatment of various neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. In a relevant study, the positive effect of tideglusib on the Wnt pathway, one of the pathways involved in bone regeneration and dentin tissue regeneration, was demonstrated. Dentin and bone tissues have structurally similar healing mechanisms. Therefore, tideglusib may have a similar effect on the bone tissue. The main goal of bone grafting is to provide bone regeneration and functional healing through remodeling. Bone graft materials are divided into four types based on their source: autogenous, allogenous, xenogenous, and alloplastic. Because these graft materials have various advantages and disadvantages, research continues to focus on alternative materials and applications. Sixteen New Zealand rabbits were included in this study. A unicortical 3.5 mm diameter defect was created in the tibia of rabbits under general anesthesia. The groups in the study were as follows: Group 1, left proximal tibia defect area was controlled (defect area was left empty); Group 2, left distal tibia defect area was treated with tideglusib + calcium sulfate; Group 3, right proximal tibia defect area was treated with calcium sulfate only; Group 4, right distal tibia defect area was treated with tideglusib only. Mediolateral (M/L) radiographs of the tibia were taken on the 30th and 60th postoperative days. On the 30th day, the first eight rabbits were sacrificed, and on the 60th day, the remaining eight were sacrificed for histopathological examination. New bone formation in the obtained samples was evaluated by radiological and histopathological analyses. The study concluded that the combination of tideglusib and calcium sulfate significantly enhanced bone healing compared with the other groups (p<0.005). This suggests that tideglusib, either alone or in combination with bone graft materials, could serve as a promising alternative for the repair of bone defects.",Polish journal of veterinary sciences,2025.0,K Yener; A Hayat,study aim evaluate effect tideglusib bone graft mixture bone healing tideglusib drug treatment neurological disorder alzheimer disease relevant study positive effect tideglusib wnt pathway pathway involve bone regeneration dentin tissue regeneration demonstrate dentin bone tissue structurally similar healing mechanism tideglusib similar effect bone tissue main goal bone grafting provide bone regeneration functional healing remodeling bone graft material divide type base source autogenous allogenous xenogenous alloplastic graft material advantage disadvantage research continue focus alternative material application sixteen new zealand rabbit include study unicortical 3.5 mm diameter defect create tibia rabbit general anesthesia group study follow group 1 leave proximal tibia defect area control defect area leave group 2 leave distal tibia defect area treat tideglusib + calcium sulfate group 3 right proximal tibia defect area treat calcium sulfate group 4 right distal tibia defect area treat tideglusib mediolateral m l radiograph tibia take 30th 60th postoperative day 30th day rabbit sacrifice 60th day remain sacrifice histopathological examination new bone formation obtain sample evaluate radiological histopathological analysis study conclude combination tideglusib calcium sulfate significantly enhance bone healing compare group p<0.005 suggest tideglusib combination bone graft material serve promising alternative repair bone defect

Postmortem studies suggested that AF is related to the degeneration of preganglionic autonomic neurons of the brainstem and spinal cord. Characterize cerebral alterations on brain imaging associated with cardiovascular AF. Cardiovascular sympathetic failure was evaluated through orthostatic hypotension (OH) based on changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure during tilt-test (ΔSBP and ΔDBP). Reduced heart rate (HR) variability reflecting cardio-vagal impairment was assessed with a composite score formed by the root-mean square differences of successive R-R intervals (RMSSD) and HR changes during deep breathing. Voxel-based morphometry (SPM12), volumetry, and cortical thickness measurements (FreeSurfer 7.0) of T1-weighted anatomical images were used to assess gray matter (GM) atrophy in sub-tentorial structures. Multivariate analysis included age, disease severity (UMSARS), and total intracranial volume as confounding factors. A total of 62 MSA patients followed at the French Reference Center were retrospectively included, aged 67.3 ± 8.6 years, 69.4% MSA-P, disease duration 4.2 ± 2.1 years. Medulla atrophy was correlated to OH (p < 0.006). Decrease in GM volume in the left anterior cerebellum (lobule V) was correlated to ΔDBP (pFWEc = 0.017).

40556475,"Validation of the ""Patient-Acceptable Symptom State"" Question as Outcome Measure in AChR Myasthenia Gravis: A Multicentre, Prospective Study.","Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) is emerging as a valuable subjective measure of the overall myasthenia gravis (MG)-related burden. This study aimed at identifying PASS-positive thresholds for the most used clinical scales, investigating whether PASS and MGFA post-intervention status capture different aspects of the disease outcome, and identifying clinical variables associated with PASS=YES response. Adult AChR-MG patients were prospectively enrolled at two Italian Centres (Rome: index cohort; Florence: validation cohort). PASS thresholds for MG-ADL, QMG, and MG-QOL15r were defined in the index cohort by ROC analysis and validated in the validation cohort; predictors of favorable PASS were identified by multivariable analysis. This study included 173 patients (44% females, median age at onset: 53 years). PASS=YES patients had significantly lower median MG-ADL, QMG, and MG-QOL15r scores, with the following thresholds for PASS=YES: MG ADL ≤ 2, QMG ≤ 8 and MG-QOL15r ≤ 6.

40556471,Video-Oculography as a Key Diagnostic Tool for SCA27B: A Real-Life Experience.,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 27B (SCA27B), caused by a GAA repeat expansion in FGF14, is a recently described genetic etiology of idiopathic late-onset cerebellar ataxia (ILOCA). Downbeat nystagmus (DBN) is increasingly recognized as a clinical hallmark of this condition. We aimed to assess the diagnostic value of video-oculography (VOG) in detecting SCA27B and its role in monitoring response to 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) in a real-world clinical setting. We retrospectively analyzed patients with ILOCA referred to Fondation Rothschild Hospital (Paris, France) from February 2023 to January 2024. All underwent clinical, MRI, and VOG assessments, with genetic testing for FGF14-GAA expansions. Clinical and oculomotor features of carriers (≥ 200 repeats) and non-carriers were compared. A subset of symptomatic carriers received 4-AP and were evaluated at baseline, 2 months, and 8 months using the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) and VOG. Twelve of 34 tested patients (35%) were FGF14-GAA expansion carriers. DBN was significantly more frequent in carriers than in non-carriers (92% vs. 33%, p = 0.003), often associated with gaze-evoked nystagmus (75% vs. 19%, p = 0.005). MRI did not distinguish carriers from non-carriers. Of the nine patients treated, all reported enhanced balance, which is corroborated by the improvement in the SARA score from a median of 5.5-3 at 2 months (p = 0.015), with sustained benefit at 8 months.

40556466,Objective adherence to oral appliance therapy in patients with obstructive sleep apnea: a one-year longitudinal analysis.,"Oral appliance (OA) therapy is widely used as an alternative to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for treating obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Traditionally, OA adherence has been assessed through subjective self-reports before, but the availability of objective adherence sensors now allows for more accurate monitoring. This study aimed to analyze one-year objective adherence data to identify adherence patterns over time and factors influencing adherence to OA therapy. Fifty-five OSA patients were recruited from a cohort study and underwent clinical follow-ups at baseline, 1, 6 and 12 months. Patients were treated with custom-made, titratable OAs, and adherence was objectively collected using embedded sensors. Adherence data were analyzed using both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) approaches. Statistical methods, including comparative analyses, logistic regression models, and multivariate linear regression were performed to identify predictors of adherence. Twenty-one patients dropped out before the 12-month follow-up, leaving 34 completed the entire study. At the 1-month follow-up, 80.0% of patients were classified as adherent, with a mean wearing time of 5.98 ± 2.38 hours per night. By 6 months, adherence decreased to 67.3%, with a mean wearing time of 5.69 ± 2.08 hours per night. Several significant predictors of adherence were identified, including larger baseline overjet, younger age, and marital status. OA adherence declined significantly within the first 6 months but stabilized between 6 and 12 months.

40556454,Grip Strength as a Marker of Resting-State Network Integrity and Well-Being in Early Psychosis.,"Psychomotor function is a critical marker of risk and outcome of psychosis. Grip strength is one aspect of psychomotor function that is known to be linked to structural neural integrity and well-being. This study sought to determine whether grip strength is a marker of alterations in resting-state connectivity and well-being in psychotic disorders in order to further clarify the mechanisms by which psychosis phenomenology is related to psychomotor processes. The authors analyzed resting-state functional MRI and grip strength in 89 individuals with early psychosis and 51 control subjects without psychiatric disorders from the Human Connectome Project for Early Psychosis. Participants ranged in age from 16 to 35 years. Using multivariate pattern analysis of whole-connectome data, the authors identified brain correlates of grip strength and then replicated this analysis using the NIH Toolbox well-being measures and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF). The psychosis group exhibited reduced grip strength, well-being, and GAF scores compared to the control group. Grip strength was linked to resting-state connectivity in the sensorimotor cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and cerebellum. Connectivity correlated with the default mode network (DMN) (r<sub>sensorimotor</sub>=0.22, r<sub>cingulate</sub>=0.30, r<sub>cerebellum</sub>=0.24). When the analysis was repeated for GAF and well-being, overlapping regions in the sensorimotor cortex and cerebellum were connected to the DMN and related to GAF (r<sub>sensorimotor</sub>=0.17, r<sub>cerebellum</sub>=0.28) and well-being (r<sub>sensorimotor</sub>=0.16, r<sub>cerebellum</sub>=0.16). Relationships were driven by the psychosis group for cerebellum and cingulate nodes. Data-driven, connectome-wide analysis identified shared brain correlates of grip strength, overall function, and well-being in a sample of young adults with psychosis and healthy control subjects. This suggests that grip strength may be a marker of DMN connectivity, which may in turn be an important marker of overall health, even in young adult populations.",The American journal of psychiatry,2025.0,Heather Burrell Ward; Adam Beermann; Karlos Manzanarez Felix; Lipika Narisetti; Kathryn E Lewandowski; Michael Coleman; Sylvain Bouix; Daphne Holt; Dost Öngür; Alan Breier; Martha E Shenton; Roscoe O Brady; Alexandra B Moussa-Tooks,psychomotor function critical marker risk outcome psychosis grip strength aspect psychomotor function know link structural neural integrity study seek determine grip strength marker alteration resting state connectivity psychotic disorder order clarify mechanism psychosis phenomenology relate psychomotor process author analyze resting state functional mri grip strength 89 individual early psychosis 51 control subject psychiatric disorder human connectome project early psychosis participant range age 16 35 year multivariate pattern analysis connectome datum author identify brain correlate grip strength replicate analysis nih toolbox measure global assessment functioning scale gaf psychosis group exhibit reduce grip strength gaf score compare control group grip strength link resting state connectivity sensorimotor cortex anterior cingulate cortex cerebellum connectivity correlate default mode network dmn r < sub > sensorimotor</sub>=0.22 r < sub > cingulate</sub>=0.30 r < sub > cerebellum</sub>=0.24 analysis repeat gaf overlap region sensorimotor cortex cerebellum connect dmn relate gaf r < sub > sensorimotor</sub>=0.17 r < sub > cerebellum</sub>=0.28 r < sub > sensorimotor</sub>=0.16 r < sub > cerebellum</sub>=0.16 relationship drive psychosis group cerebellum cingulate node data drive connectome wide analysis identify share brain correlate grip strength overall function sample young adult psychosis healthy control subject suggest grip strength marker dmn connectivity turn important marker overall health young adult population
40556437,"Investigations Into the Outbreak of Chandipura Virus Encephalitis, Gujarat, India, 2024.","Chandipura virus, a Vesiculovirus, was first identified in India during an outbreak investigation of acute febrile illness in 1965. The virus first gained global attention after being implicated as the causative agent of an outbreak of acute viral encephalitis characterized by rapid clinical deterioration and death, in 2003. Since then, the virus has caused multiple outbreaks in central and western Indian states. During July 2024, an increased incidence of acute encephalitis was reported from Gujarat state. In response an outbreak investigation was carried out and Chandipura virus was identified as the major etiology, accounting for 23.45% of the cases. Clinically, the disease was characterized by rapid progression of illness, with total duration of illness ranging from 24 to 72 h in majority of the cases. Vomiting was found to be significantly more in cases of Chandipura viral encephalitis. In the current outbreak, multiorgan dysfunction was identified as a complication in Chandipura infections. Serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase and creatinine were found to be significantly elevated in cases of Chandipura encephalitis, compared to other etiologies of acute viral encephalitis. The case fatality rate in the current outbreak was 47.36%. Among the samples collected during the investigations, 69% humans and 8.76% animal samples tested positive for neutralizing antibodies against Chandipura virus. Fever surveillance during the outbreak also identified Chandipura IgM positive cases without neurological involvement, raising the possibility of Chandipura febrile illness.

40556376,Brain Microstructure Interrogation by Diffusion Tensor and Kurtosis Imaging in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Subtypes.,"Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is commonly used to assess the integrity of gray and white matter (WM) structures in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Beyond DTI, nontraditional diffusion techniques such as diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) have been shown to characterize brain tissue further. In this work, we aim to determine the utility of DKI in the differential diagnosis of PSP-Richardson syndrome (PSP-RS) and PSP with predominant parkinsonism (PSP-P) from Parkinson's disease (PD) and controls. A multishell diffusion-weighted sequence was acquired at 3 Tesla on a Siemens system in 22 patients with PSP-RS, 23 with PSP-P, 19 with PD, and 19 controls. Fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, kurtosis fractional anisotropy (KFA), and mean kurtosis (Kmean) were calculated for nine deep gray matter regions and six different WM tracts. DKI identified differences (not found by DTI) between control and PSP groups in the globus pallidum externus, subthalamic region, and putamen, with Kmean in the putamen able to differentiate PSP-RS and PD. DKI WM measurements in the body of the corpus callosum and dentatorubrothalamic tract differentiated PSP-RS from PD, and the corticostriatal tract differentiated PSP-P from PD. KFA in the body of the corpus callosum identified worse microstructural anomalies in PSP-RS compared to PSP-P. DKI metrics correlated with the severity of ocular motor impairment and parkinsonism scores. DKI measurements could differentiate PSP-RS, PSP-P, and PD and, hence, may be a promising imaging tool for studying structural neuropathological changes in PSP.",Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of Neuroimaging,2025.0,Rodolfo G Gatto; Hossam Youssef; Nha Trang Thu Pham; Farwa Ali; Heather M Clark; Julie Stierwalt; Yehkyoung Stephens; Mary M Machulda; Keith A Josephs; Jennifer L Whitwell,diffusion tensor imaging dti commonly assess integrity gray white matter wm structure progressive supranuclear palsy psp dti nontraditional diffusion technique diffusion kurtosis imaging dki show characterize brain tissue work aim determine utility dki differential diagnosis psp richardson syndrome psp rs psp predominant parkinsonism psp p parkinson disease pd control multishell diffusion weight sequence acquire 3 tesla siemens system 22 patient psp rs 23 psp p 19 pd 19 control fractional anisotropy mean diffusivity kurtosis fractional anisotropy kfa mean kurtosis kmean calculate deep gray matter region different wm tract dki identify difference find dti control psp group globus pallidum externus subthalamic region putaman kmean putaman able differentiate psp rs pd dki wm measurement body corpus callosum dentatorubrothalamic tract differentiate psp rs pd corticostriatal tract differentiate psp p pd kfa body corpus callosum identify bad microstructural anomaly psp rs compare psp p. dki metric correlate severity ocular motor impairment parkinsonism score dki measurement differentiate psp rs psp p pd promising imaging tool study structural neuropathological change psp
40556366,Effects of Dual Inhibition of VEGF-A and Angpt-2 on Angiogenesis and Lymphangiogenesis in an Alkali-Induced Corneal Injury Model.,"Corneal neovascularization (CNV) is frequently observed after various corneal injuries and corneal transplantation, leading to impairment of corneal transparency. Lymphangiogenesis and the inflammatory response often accompany CNV. Chemical injury is one of the most common causes of CNV, and alkali injury has been widely used as an animal model of this pathological state. We examined the effects of subconjunctival injection of an anti-VEGFA antibody (anti-VEGFA_ab), anti-ANGPT2 antibody (anti-ANGPT2_ab), and bispecific antibody against VEGFA and ANGPT2 (BsAb) in CNV using the alkali injury mouse model. The pathological indexes were examined using anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) and whole-mount immunostaining, and gene expression patterns were examined using RT-qPCR. Treatment with anti-VEGFA_ab, anti-ANGPT2_ab, or BsAb did not affect the swelled thickness of the cornea; however, angiogenesis, but not lymphangiogenesis, was hampered by the treatment of either one of the antibodies. We observed an increase in the mRNA levels of Vegfa, Angpt2, Il1b, and Cx3cr1 following alkali injury. The administration of BsAb suppressed the induction of Vegfa and Cx3cr1. Additionally, BsAb treatment enhanced the mRNA levels of Angpt1 in this model.

40556363,Enhancing Duloxetine With Mirogabalin for Treating Taxane-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy in Advanced Lung Cancer.,"IntroductionTaxane-based cytotoxic anticancer drugs are a cornerstone of advanced lung cancer chemotherapy; however, they often result in chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Along with prolonged recovery, CIPN may cause irreversible damage. Consequently, dose reduction or discontinuation is justified, potentially impacting therapeutic efficacy. With no established treatment for CIPN, low-dose duloxetine is generally used as a supportive drug. However, studies have shown the potential effect of mirogabalin on CIPN. Therefore, at our hospital, patients with advanced lung cancer experiencing CIPN during taxane-based first-line therapy received low-dose duloxetine, and were subsequently treated with mirogabalin.MethodsIn this study, we conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of the impact of mirogabalin administration on 14 advanced lung cancer patients when duloxetine alone was deemed insufficient. The median age was 71 years (52-89 years), with 9 male and 5 female patients. The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) was utilized to evaluate outcomes, and Wilcoxon's signed rank-sum test was used in statistical analysis.ResultsThe median Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score decreased from 5.5 (interquartile range [IQR]: 4.5-7.0) before to 4.0 (IQR: 3.0-5.0) after mirogabalin administration (<i>P</i> = 0.041), indicating significant pain reduction.ConclusionThe addition of mirogabalin to duloxetine shows promise in alleviating CIPN in advanced lung cancer patients treated with taxane anticancer agents.

After VWR exercise in the AD mice, the rapid eye movement sleep was increased by 89%. The levels of circadian clock genes were significantly changed (brain and muscle arnt-like protein 1 [BMAL1] and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptorsα [RORα] reduced by 45.7% and 36.4%, reverse erythroblastosis virusα (REV-ERBα) increased by 119%) in the SCN by immunofluorescence staining, with the mRNA levels were markedly altered (Bmal1 and Rorα decreased by 57% and 68%, Rev-erbα elevated by 79%) in the hypothalamus at Zeitgeber Time 1; phospho-tau 231 (p-tau231) was reduced by 35%, whereas vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) was elevated by 38.7% in the SCN. In addition, ionized calcium binding adapter molecude 1 (Iba1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), amyloid β (Aβ), and p-tau231 were significantly reduced in the hippocampus and cortex. Our results demonstrate that VWR exercise improves sleep disorders, cognitive deficits, and neuropathology in AD mice. Voluntary wheel running (VWR) exercise improves the behavioral circadian rhythm disorder and sleep structure disturbance in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice. After VWR exercise, there is a significant change in the expression levels of circadian clock genes, and a remarkable reduction of tau phosphorylation and axonal damage in the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The levels of beta-site amyloid precurson protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) are reduced in the hypothalamus after VWR exercise in AD mice.

40556318,"Novel early-onset Alzheimer-associated genes influence risk through dysregulation of glutamate, immune activation, and intracellular signaling pathways.","Most genetic studies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been focused on late-onset AD (LOAD). There are no large genetic studies on early-onset AD (EOAD). We performed a multi-ancestry (non-Hispanic European, African, and East Asian) genome-wide association study (GWAS) including a total of 7,349 cases and 17,887 control.

Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and rates of ancillary study participation were described with means and frequencies. U.S. POINTER successfully enrolled a cohort, ages 60-79 years, which was ethno-racially inclusive (>30% individuals from groups often under-represented in clinical trials with cognitive outcomes) and 18% residing in neighborhoods with moderate or high levels of socioeconomic deprivation. Enrollees were cognitively intact but at increased risk for cognitive decline. Participation in ancillary studies (overall 73%) was uniformly high across sociodemographic groups.

40556310,Differences in electrode placements between consensual and nonconsensual electroconvulsive therapy: retrospective chart review study.,"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is often used to treat severe mental disorders in individuals with impaired capacity to consent to the treatment. Little is known about how different types of electrode placement are used in consensual and nonconsensual ECT. To investigate whether there was an association between ECT consent status and electrode placement, given that ECT electrode placement affects efficacy and cognitive outcomes. Using a statewide database across 3 years in Victoria, Australia, we performed chi-squared tests to determine whether consent status (consensual versus nonconsensual) was associated with particular electrode placements. A three-way log-linear analysis was then conducted to examine whether age, gender, level of education and psychiatric diagnosis influenced the relationship between consent status and electrode placement. Given the comparable cognitive outcomes of right unilateral and bifrontal ECT, these electrode placements were combined in the analysis. In total, 3882 participants received ECT in the Victorian public health service during the study period. In the nonconsensual ECT group, 722 of 1576 individuals (45.81%) received bitemporal ECT, compared with 555 of 2306 (24.06%) in the consensual group (<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup> = 200.53; <i>P</i> < 0.0001; odds ratio: 2.6673, 95% CI: 2.3244-3.0608). This association remained significant after adjustment for gender, age, level of education and diagnosis. Significantly more participants in the nonconsensual ECT group received bitemporal ECT rather than right unilateral or bifrontal ECT compared with those in the consensual group.

Changes in the cingulate cortex may be central to this disorder. This study investigates subregional alterations in the cingulate cortex of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and their relationship to cognitive deficits using functional and perfusion imaging. Thirty-eight patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and 30 healthy controls (HC) underwent resting-state MRI and neuropsychological assessments. We measured low-frequency amplitude (fALFF), degree centrality (DC), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the cingulate cortex, and performed functional connectivity (FC) and CBF connectivity analyses. We also analyzed the relationship between subregional changes and cognitive impairment. Finally, we applied support vector machines (SVM) to classify patients and controls based on functional and perfusion features. Patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis showed significant cognitive impairments in memory and executive function, along with anxiety symptoms. Neuroimaging revealed decreased fALFF, DC, and CBF in the left pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC.L). FC between pgACC.L and several brain regions, including the parahippocampal gyrus and precuneus, was reduced. Additionally, pgACC.L exhibited altered CBF connectivity patterns with other brain regions. Moreover, the changes of fALFF, DC, and FC are related to the impaired cognitive function of patients.

40556129,Optimizing GBM organoid construction with hydrogel-based models: GelMA-HAMA scaffold supports GBM organoids with clonal growth for drug screening.,"Adult glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly malignant tumor with a poor prognosis and high mortality rate. As versatile 3D culture systems <i>in vitro</i>, organoid models are emerging as a promising new tool for GBM research and combat. However, Matrigel, the most used extracellular matrix, is animal-derived with a complex composition and significant batch-to-batch variability, requiring further optimization for GBM organoid construction. Hydrogels, high-affinity polymers, have been widely employed in organoid construction for their customizable properties. In the present study, we selected and tested several commonly used hydrogel materials-hyaluronic acid methacryloyl (HAMA), chitosan methacryloyl (CSMA), and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA)-for the construction of GBM organoids. To address the limitations of a single Matrigel, we combined Matrigel with different hydrogels and found that hydrogels influenced glioblastoma stem cells and organoid formation in distinct ways. Matrigel-HAMA (MH) promoted the formation of independent spherical clones but with a significantly lower glioblastoma stem cell (GSC) proliferation rate. GelMA-HAMA(GH) could replace Matrigel preserving the characteristics and proliferative capacity of GSCs and supported the formation of more compact spherical clones than MH did.

Claims about this estimated relationship have recently proliferated within and beyond scientific research, particularly amidst escalating political struggles over the rights and recognition of trans people. Our study critically analyses discursive patterns among these claims to investigate how and to what effects diverse actors construct the intersection of autism and trans identities. We qualitatively analysed a purposive sample of 30 texts, including psychological research, clinical literature, news and opinion articles, state legislation, activist materials and autistic trans individuals' published narratives. We propose that claims about the autistic-trans intersection can be understood through four discursive types: psychiatrisation, repressive protection, medical management and affirmation and reclamation. These types represent differently patterned ways of (1) explaining medical vs. social 'causes' of the intersection and (2) legitimising versus delegitimising autistic trans identities, with each type promoting distinctive medical, cultural and political practices as responses.

Structured questionnaires were used to interview the study population, and all of them underwent ear, nose, and throat examinations, tympanometry, and pure tone audiometry for those aged >5 years after obtaining informed consent and medical ethics committee approval. Data were analyzed using international business machine (IBM) corporation statistical product and service solution (SPSS) version 25 software. Descriptive analysis was performed using tables, graphs, and charts, whereas inferential statistics were obtained using the Chi-square test of independence or Fisher's exact test, t-test, or analysis of variance (ANOVA). Statistical significance was set at P value < 0.05. The median ages of the SCD patients and their controls were 18 and 23 years, respectively. SCD patients have higher hearing thresholds, with 8.9% conductive loss, 4.5% unilateral mild mixed hearing loss, and 3.3% sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) (2.0% among the controls; P value of 0.669), and more commonly in the right ear. The overall HL prevalence was 16.7% SCD patients and 8.0% controls (double; P value of 0.067). SNHL is mostly mild and unilateral in nature and affects only adults. Type B tympanogram was only reported in children with SCD. HbSS was the most prevalent genotype, with greater (double) HL than controls, affecting the right ear of males. HL patterns included mild conductive HL, mixed HL, and SNHL. SCD could be a risk factor for OME.",Nigerian journal of clinical practice,2025.0,A G Adekanye; J B Okoi-Obuli; K O Akaba; A Umana; P M Francis,sickle cell disease patient high level hear threshold susceptibility pneumococcal infection otitis medium vaso occlusive injury cochlea study aim determine association hemoglobin variant hearing threshold hear loss hl tympanometry distribution patient sickle cell disease scd hospital base study conduct september 2019 september 2021 recruit 110 confirm ss sc patient adult pediatric sickle cell clinic calabar sickle cell club 110 healthy control aa structured questionnaire interview study population undergo ear nose throat examination tympanometry pure tone audiometry age > 5 year obtain inform consent medical ethic committee approval datum analyze international business machine ibm corporation statistical product service solution spss version 25 software descriptive analysis perform table graph chart inferential statistic obtain chi square test independence fisher exact test t test analysis variance anova statistical significance set p value < 0.05 median age scd patient control 18 23 year respectively scd patient high hearing threshold 8.9 conductive loss 4.5 unilateral mild mixed hearing loss 3.3 sensorineural hearing loss snhl 2.0 control p value 0.669 commonly right ear overall hl prevalence 16.7 scd patient 8.0 control double p value 0.067 snhl mild unilateral nature affect adult type b tympanogram report child scd hbss prevalent genotype great double hl control affect right ear male hl pattern include mild conductive hl mixed hl snhl scd risk factor ome
40556084,Assocıatıons Between Vıtamın D Receptor Gene Polymorphısms and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.,"Vitamin D deficiency is associated with Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), and Vitamin D supplementation may improve symptoms and electrophysiological findings in CTS patients. The biological effects of vitamin D may be modified by various genetic factors, including single nucleotide polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene. With this study, we aimed to show whether Taq I and Fok I polymorphisms of the VDR gene cause an increase in the occurrence and severity of carpal tunnel syndrome. 100 CTS patients and 100 healthy controls were included in this study. The severity of CTS was determined by electromyography and the patients were divided into 3 groups: mild, moderate and severe CTS. The Fok I and Taq I genotypes of the participants were determined from the peripheral blood samples taken from all participants. Genotypes and allele frequencies were compared between patient and control groups. VDR Fok I genotype distribution and allele frequency showed a significant relationship with the risk of developing CTS and its severity. Taq I, on the other hand, was not associated with the risk of developing CTS or its severity. VDR Fok I polymorphism increases the risk of developing CTS and the risk of severe CTS in the Turkish population. Further studies on this subject are needed to further understand the relationship between CTS and VDR polymorphisms and explain its mechanism.",Nigerian journal of clinical practice,2025.0,B Yildiz; F E Algul; E Yesilada,vitamin d deficiency associate carpal tunnel syndrome cts vitamin d supplementation improve symptom electrophysiological finding cts patient biological effect vitamin d modify genetic factor include single nucleotide polymorphism vitamin d receptor vdr gene study aim taq fok polymorphism vdr gene cause increase occurrence severity carpal tunnel syndrome 100 cts patient 100 healthy control include study severity cts determine electromyography patient divide 3 group mild moderate severe cts fok taq genotype participant determine peripheral blood sample take participant genotypes allele frequency compare patient control group vdr fok genotype distribution allele frequency show significant relationship risk develop cts severity taq hand associate risk develop cts severity vdr fok polymorphism increase risk develop cts risk severe cts turkish population study subject need understand relationship cts vdr polymorphism explain mechanism
40556075,'I Feel Like I'm Hitting A Wall or There's A Narrow Tunnel': A Qualitative Study Based on Online Forum Posts by Women With Vaginismus.,"Women may find it difficult to seek face-to-face support, as topics related to sexuality are often considered taboo. The online environment makes it easier to interact with others and share stories while using an anonymous username. This study aimed to explore the lived experiences of women with vaginismus by analysing online forum posts. By examining unfiltered personal narratives, we sought to gain insights into their challenges, coping mechanisms, and the factors influencing their help-seeking behaviours without the constraints of predefined research questions. Qualitative content analysis was used to explore the lived experiences of women with vaginismus. For this study, we used a simple search phrase, such as 'vaginismus forum', on Google, the most widely used online search engine. In this context, we chose an online forum with different topics to collect data to explore different perspectives of vaginismus patients. Posts from this topic were collected between November 2020 and November 2023. A total of 17,900 posts from the relevant dates were reviewed for analysis. The data was coded and analysed using qualitative content analysis. Three main themes and 12 subthemes were identified: (1) Facing the reality of vaginismus, (2) Obstacles for women with vaginismus to get help, (3) Facilitators to fight vaginismus. This study provides qualitative evidence on the experiences of women with vaginismus, shedding light on the challenges they face. The findings highlight that while stigma, emotional distress, and unsupportive environments create barriers, supportive partners, professional guidance, and online communities play a crucial role in their recovery process.

A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, ERIC, Global Health and PsycINFO was conducted in October 2024. Eligible studies included randomised controlled trials, quasi-experimental and qualitative research on school-based interventions in low- and middle-income countries for children and adolescents with NDDs (including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], autism, intellectual disabilities, epilepsy, cerebral palsy and foetal alcohol syndrome), as well as those involving their caregivers, teachers or peers. Only studies published in English, Spanish or Portuguese were included. A narrative synthesis was performed. A total of 2158 titles were screened, with 29 studies from 13 countries included. Most studies used a quasi-experimental design (n = 19, 66%). Nearly half focused on children and adolescents with NDDs only (n = 14, 48%), with intellectual disabilities being the most targeted condition (n = 12, 34%), followed by autism (n = 8, 23%) and ADHD (n = 8, 23%). Intervention strategies included multimodal approaches (n = 6, 21%) and educational workshops (n = 6, 21%). Targeted outcomes were social skills (n = 7, 16%) and knowledge attitudes and practice (n = 5, 12%). Lifelong learning (n = 11, 33%) and educational system-strengthening interventions (n = 10, 31%) were the primary content areas. The majority of studies exhibited a moderate to high risk of bias. Schools offer strategic platforms for delivering mental health and psychosocial support interventions to children and adolescents with NDDs in low- and middle-income countries, involving families, teachers and peers.

40556027,Robust molecular subgrouping and reference-free aneuploidy detection in medulloblastoma using low-depth whole genome bisulfite sequencing.,"Medulloblastoma comprises four principal molecular disease groups and their component subgroups, each with distinct molecular and clinical features. Group assignment is currently achieved diagnostically using Illumina DNA methylation microarray. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) capacity is rapidly expanding in the clinical setting and the development of platform-independent, sequence-based assays of molecular group offers significant potential. Specifically, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) enables assessment of genome-wide methylation status at single-base resolution, however its routine application has been limited by high DNA input requirements, cost, and a lack of pipelines tailored to more rapidly-acquired and cost-effective low-depth (< 10x) sequencing data. We utilised WGBS data for 69 medulloblastomas, comprising 35 in-house low-depth (~ 10x) and 34 publicly available high-depth (~ 30x) samples, alongside cerebellar controls (n = 8), all with matched DNA methylation microarray data. We assessed quality (QC) and imputation approaches using low-pass WGBS data, assessed inter-platform correlation and identified molecular groups and subgroups by directly integrating matched/associated loci from WGBS sample data with the MNP classifier probeset. We further assessed and optimised reference-free aneuploidy detection using low-pass WGBS and assessed concordance with microarray-derived calls. We developed and optimised pipelines for processing, QC, and analysis of low-pass WGBS data, suitable for routine molecular subgrouping and reference-free aneuploidy assessment. We demonstrate that low-pass WGBS data can (i) be integrated into existing array-trained models with high assignment probabilities for both principal molecular groups (97% concordance) and molecular subgroups (94.2% concordance), and (ii) detect clinically relevant focal copy number changes, including SNCAIP, with greater sensitivity than microarray approaches. Low-pass WGBS performs equivalently to array-based methods at comparable cost. Finally, its ascertainment of the full methylome enables elucidation of additional biological complexity and inter-tumoural heterogeneity that has hitherto been inaccessible. These findings provide proof-of-concept for clinical adoption of low-pass WGBS, applied using standard WGS technology.",Acta neuropathologica communications,2025.0,Dean Thompson; Jemma Castle; Martin Sill; Stefan M Pfister; Simon Bailey; Debbie Hicks; Steven C Clifford; Edward C Schwalbe,medulloblastoma comprise principal molecular disease group component subgroup distinct molecular clinical feature group assignment currently achieve diagnostically illumina dna methylation microarray genome sequencing wgs capacity rapidly expand clinical setting development platform independent sequence base assay molecular group offer significant potential specifically genome bisulfite sequence wgbs enable assessment genome wide methylation status single base resolution routine application limit high dna input requirement cost lack pipeline tailor rapidly acquire cost effective low depth < 10x sequence datum utilise wgbs datum 69 medulloblastoma comprise 35 house low depth ~ 10x 34 publicly available high depth ~ 30x sample alongside cerebellar control n = 8) match dna methylation microarray datum assess quality qc imputation approach low pass wgbs datum assess inter platform correlation identify molecular group subgroup directly integrate match associate loci wgbs sample datum mnp classifier probeset assess optimise reference free aneuploidy detection low pass wgbs assess concordance microarray derive call develop optimise pipeline processing qc analysis low pass wgbs datum suitable routine molecular subgroupe reference free aneuploidy assessment demonstrate low pass wgbs datum integrate exist array train model high assignment probability principal molecular group 97 concordance molecular subgroup 94.2 concordance ii detect clinically relevant focal copy number change include sncaip great sensitivity microarray approach low pass wgbs perform equivalently array base method comparable cost finally ascertainment methylome enable elucidation additional biological complexity inter tumoural heterogeneity hitherto inaccessible finding provide proof concept clinical adoption low pass wgbs apply standard wgs technology
40556014,Does treatment of adolescent depression reduce risk of later psychosis: A quasi-experimental study of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment in a total population cohort.,"Psychotic disorders are frequently preceded by depressive disorders, and it has been hypothesized that treatment of depression in youth may reduce risk for later psychosis. Using quasi-experimental methods, we estimated the causal relationship between the treatment of adolescent depression with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and the risk of later psychosis. We used data linkage from multiple national Finnish registries for all individuals (<i>n</i> = 697,289) born between 1987 and 1997 to identify depression diagnosed before age 18, cumulative SSRI treatment within three years of diagnosis, and diagnoses of non-affective psychotic disorders by end of follow-up (age 20-29). We used instrumental variable analyses, exploiting variability in prescribing across hospital districts to estimate causal effects. Analyses were conducted using two-stage least squares modelling. Sensitivity analyses examined effects stratified by confounders and effects of specific SSRIs. Our final sample included 22,666 individuals diagnosed with depression in adolescence, of whom 60.2% (<i>n</i> = 13,650) had used SSRIs. 10.7% of adolescents with depression went on to be diagnosed with a non-affective psychotic disorder. SSRI treatment for adolescent depression was not associated with a reduced risk of developing a psychotic disorder (one-year <i>β =</i> 0.04,CI:-0.01 to 0.09; two-years <i>β =</i> 0.02,CI:-0.06 to 0.09; three-years <i>β =</i> -0.02,CI:-0.08 to 0.05). Our quasi-experimental investigation does not support the hypothesis that treatment of adolescent depression reduces the subsequent risk of psychosis.

40556004,Effect of deterioration of swallowing functions on the frailty status in older adults: a longitudinal cohort study.,"Deterioration of swallowing function (DSF) is common among aging adults and can lead to negative health outcomes such as increased risk of malnutrition. However, the longitudinal relationship between the DSF and frailty status remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether declining swallowing function is linked to frailty progression in independent older adults. This study included 795 community-dwelling Japanese individuals aged ≥ 65 years who participated in two surveys: one at baseline and one after two years. Swallowing function was evaluated using the repetitive saliva swallowing test, tongue pressure test, and questionnaire. DSF was identified by meeting more than one of three criteria: Repeated Saliva Swallow Test below 3, tongue pressure under 27.4 kPa for men and 26.5 kPa for women, and a ""yes"" response to the questionnaire. Frailty status was assessed using the Kihon Checklist, with participants showing a decline categorized into the ""aggravation group."" Oral function (number of teeth, occlusal force, masticatory performance, and oral dryness) and physical function (body mass index, gait speed, grip strength, and skeletal muscle mass index) were evaluated. Comparisons between the two groups were made using the Student's t-test or the χ2 test. Differences among the three groups were assessed using the one-way analysis of variance or the χ2 test. Significant differences in continuous variables were analyzed using the Least Significant Difference method, with P-values adjusted using the Bonferroni correction. Initially, 87 (10.9%) participants were frail. By follow-up, 149 participants (37.9%) had progressed to frailty, 83 of whom (55.7%) exhibited impaired swallowing function at baseline. At baseline, frailty was significantly associated with age, gait speed, decreased swallowing function, number of functional teeth, occlusal force, and masticatory performance. None of the three swallowing function assessment methods were significantly associated with the progression of frailty. In contrast, logistic regression analysis of frailty progression showed that impaired swallowing function was a significant explanatory variable (OR, 1.53; 95% CI: 1.04-2.21). This study found a significant association between frailty and multiple factors, particularly oral function. Specifically, diminished swallowing function has emerged as a notable independent predictor of frailty progression.",BMC geriatrics,2025.0,En-Chih Weng; Yoko Hasegawa; Tasuku Yoshimoto; Ma Therese Sta Maria; Koutatsu Nagai; Naoko Sato; Kana Tokumoto; Kazuhiro Hori; Hiroshi Kusunoki; Hiromitsu Kishimoto; Ken Shinmura,deterioration swallow function dsf common age adult lead negative health outcome increase risk malnutrition longitudinal relationship dsf frailty status remain unclear study aim investigate decline swallowing function link frailty progression independent old adult study include 795 community dwell japanese individual age ≥ 65 year participate survey baseline year swallowing function evaluate repetitive saliva swallowing test tongue pressure test questionnaire dsf identify meet criterion repeated saliva swallow test 3 tongue pressure 27.4 kpa man 26.5 kpa woman yes response questionnaire frailty status assess kihon checklist participant show decline categorize aggravation group oral function number tooth occlusal force masticatory performance oral dryness physical function body mass index gait speed grip strength skeletal muscle mass index evaluate comparison group student t test χ2 test difference group assess way analysis variance χ2 test significant difference continuous variable analyze significant difference method p value adjust bonferroni correction initially 87 10.9 participant frail follow 149 participant 37.9 progress frailty 83 55.7 exhibit impaired swallowing function baseline baseline frailty significantly associate age gait speed decrease swallowing function number functional tooth occlusal force masticatory performance swallow function assessment method significantly associate progression frailty contrast logistic regression analysis frailty progression show impair swallowing function significant explanatory variable 1.53 95 ci 1.04 2.21 study find significant association frailty multiple factor particularly oral function specifically diminish swallowing function emerge notable independent predictor frailty progression
40555967,Innovative Synchronous Spectrofluorometric Method for Assessing a Novel Drug Combination in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: In Vivo Human Application With Greenness and Sustainability Evaluation.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe neurological disorder that causes damage to sensory neurons, then paralysis and death. A novel combination of celecoxib (CXP) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) has recently been used to enhance both motor performance and CNS cell morphology, alterations in the rate of disease progression, quality of life, and survival, which passed phase IIb RCT study. Celecoxib is classified as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that has a synergistic effect for the treatment of ALS, which is a severe neurological disorder. A new sustainable, simple, sensitive, and environmentally friendly synchronous spectrofluorimetric approach (SSF) was established to simultaneously estimate celecoxib and ciprofloxacin in pure form and biological fluids. The approach depends on synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy, where CXP and CIP were detected at 364 and 438 nm, correspondingly, using Δλ of 80-nm utilizing sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) micellar system, which considerably improved synchronous fluorescence intensity. The approach was validated and revealed excellent linearity with concentrations varying from 10 to 10,000 and 5 to 20,000 ng/mL for CXP and CIP; correspondingly, CXP and CIP showed extremely low limits of detection (LODs) 0.58-0.24 ng/mL, which guarantee the sensitivity of the proposed approach. The suggested approach was successfully implemented to analyze the co-administered pharmaceuticals in their pure form and actual human plasma after concurrent oral administration of both drugs, which may be employed in an inquiry on the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of human plasma to the new coming PrimeC pharmaceutical formulation. Ultimately, the method's remarkable greenness was proved by evaluating its greenness profile using various assessment strategies.

40555935,Inhibition of Rac1 Attenuated Propofol-Induced Neurotoxicity in the Hippocampal Dentate Gyrus in Developing Mice.,"Accumulating evidence from animals has shown that multiple exposures to general anesthetics during brain development may cause extensive neuronal apoptosis and long-term memory impairments. However, the underlying mechanism is still poorly understood. In the present study, C57BL/6 mice were administered with propofol at postnatal days 19-21. We found that propofol exposure significantly increased neuronal apoptosis in the mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus, as evidenced by cleaved caspase-3 immunofluorescence. Additionally, propofol exposure increased the activation and expression of Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) in the dentate gyrus, as shown by western blotting. Modulating Rac1, either through inhibition or overexpression, was found to mitigate or exacerbate propofol-induced neuronal apoptosis, respectively. We further demonstrated that propofol decreased the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein phosphorylated serine/threonine kinase Akt via Rac1. The results of the open field and Morris water maze test further revealed that silencing Rac1 alleviated propofol-induced cognitive dysfunction. Our findings demonstrated that propofol exposure induced neuronal apoptosis and long-term cognitive dysfunction in the mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus by regulating Rac1.",Neurochemical research,2025.0,Yuan Li; Haifeng Duan; Qi Wang; Yi Lin; Zhoujing Yang; Zhiru Wang; Yingwei Wang; Kai Wei; Daojie Xu,accumulate evidence animal show multiple exposure general anesthetic brain development cause extensive neuronal apoptosis long term memory impairment underlying mechanism poorly understand present study c57bl/6 mouse administer propofol postnatal day 19 21 find propofol exposure significantly increase neuronal apoptosis mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus evidence cleave caspase-3 immunofluorescence additionally propofol exposure increase activation expression ras relate c3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 rac1 dentate gyrus show western blotting modulate rac1 inhibition overexpression find mitigate exacerbate propofol induce neuronal apoptosis respectively demonstrate propofol decrease expression anti apoptotic protein phosphorylate serine threonine kinase akt rac1 result open field morris water maze test reveal silence rac1 alleviate propofol induce cognitive dysfunction finding demonstrate propofol exposure induce neuronal apoptosis long term cognitive dysfunction mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus regulate rac1
40555892,Quaking Protein in Myelin Maintenance and Regeneration in the Central Nervous System.,"Synthesized by oligodendrocytes (OLGs) in the central nervous system (CNS), the myelin sheath is a multilamellar structure that enables the rapid transmission of action potentials and provides metabolic support to the axons it surrounds. In multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic neurological disorder, the myelin membrane becomes the target of immune-mediated attacks. These attacks trigger the release of inflammatory cytokines and activate microglia (MG) and astrocytes, leading to severe demyelination and neurodegeneration. Quaking (QKI) is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that plays a critical role in CNS myelination by regulating RNA metabolism and lipid homeostasis in glial cells. Through its major isoforms-QKI-5, QKI-6, and QKI-7-QKI orchestrates essential post-transcriptional processes in OLGs, including splicing, stability, nuclear export, and local translation of key myelin transcripts. QKI deficiency alters the expression of numerous genes involved in axonal ensheathment and myelination pathways, such as MBP, PLP1, MAG, and Nfasc155. QKI also modulates cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis by acting as a transcriptional coactivator, ensuring the proper lipid composition of the myelin sheath. In MG, QKI regulates phagosome maturation and the expression of inflammatory genes, thus promoting efficient clearance of myelin debris and fostering a permissive environment for remyelination. Reduced QKI expression has been documented in MS and its experimental models. In this context, this review summarizes current evidence positioning QKI as a central regulator of myelin maintenance and regeneration and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for demyelinating diseases.",Molecular neurobiology,2025.0,Laura Thomas; María Verónica Galante Pasquini; Laura Andrea Pasquini,synthesize oligodendrocyte olgs central nervous system cns myelin sheath multilamellar structure enable rapid transmission action potential provide metabolic support axon surround multiple sclerosis ms chronic neurological disorder myelin membrane target immune mediate attack attack trigger release inflammatory cytokine activate microglia mg astrocyte lead severe demyelination neurodegeneration quaking qki multifunctional rna bind protein play critical role cns myelination regulate rna metabolism lipid homeostasis glial cell major isoform qki-5 qki-6 qki-7 qki orchestrate essential post transcriptional process olg include splicing stability nuclear export local translation key myelin transcript qki deficiency alter expression numerous gene involve axonal ensheathment myelination pathway mbp plp1 mag nfasc155 qki modulate cholesterol fatty acid biosynthesis act transcriptional coactivator ensure proper lipid composition myelin sheath mg qki regulate phagosome maturation expression inflammatory gene promote efficient clearance myelin debris foster permissive environment remyelination reduce qki expression document ms experimental model context review summarize current evidence position qki central regulator myelin maintenance regeneration highlight potential therapeutic target demyelinate disease
40555887,The Role of Interpersonal Characteristics in Early and Developing Therapeutic Alliance Among Periadolescents with Anxiety.,"Little work has examined associations between interpersonal factors and changes in the therapeutic alliance. We examined the association between baseline youth family and peer interpersonal characteristics and therapeutic alliance throughout treatment in a sample of anxious youths who received cognitive behavioral therapy or client-centered therapy. Youths (N = 135; M = 10.94; SD = 1.46) were in a randomized clinical trial for anxiety disorders. Interpersonal characteristics were assessed via parent-report, youth self-report, and observational methods. Lower levels of parent-rated shyness, higher levels of positive interpersonal style, and being female were associated with higher early therapist-rated alliance. Being female was associated with more rapid increases in therapist-rated alliance.

40555884,Association between vitamin D level and sleep quality in the elderly population: a prospective cohort study.,"Vitamin D is essential not only for skeletal health but also for regulating sleep. Recent studies suggest a link between vitamin D deficiency and poor sleep quality, including lower sleep efficiency and shorter sleep duration. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between sleep quality and serum vitamin D levels in healthy elderly individuals. This study examined the association between serum vitamin D levels and sleep quality in individuals aged 60 years and above residing in Taipei's Health & Culture Village and Active Aging Center. A total of 465 participants were enrolled, with those exhibiting specific organ abnormalities or dysfunctions excluded. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and vitamin D levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The relationships between vitamin D levels and PSQI scores were analyzed, with a focus on the daytime dysfunction component of the PSQI. Among the seven domains of the PSQI, the daytime dysfunction domain had the strongest statistical association with serum vitamin D levels (p = 0.044). Participants without daytime dysfunction had significantly higher vitamin D levels than did those with daytime dysfunction (p = 0.04). No significant associations were detected between vitamin D levels and other factors, such as sex or age. Higher serum vitamin D levels are associated with better sleep quality in elderly individuals, particularly in those without daytime dysfunction. This finding highlights the potential importance of maintaining adequate vitamin D levels to promote healthy sleep patterns in older adults.",Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung,2025.0,Wei-Hsuan Lee; Yu-Hsi Chen; Tsai-Yu Wang; Wen-Jui Chang; Ting-Wei Liao; Wei-Syun Hung; Shih-Wei Lin; Ning-Hung Chen; Ji-Tseng Fang; Li-Pang Chuang,vitamin d essential skeletal health regulate sleep recent study suggest link vitamin d deficiency poor sleep quality include low sleep efficiency short sleep duration study aim investigate relationship sleep quality serum vitamin d level healthy elderly individual study examine association serum vitamin d level sleep quality individual age 60 year reside taipei health culture village active aging center total 465 participant enrol exhibit specific organ abnormality dysfunction exclude sleep quality assess pittsburgh sleep quality index psqi vitamin d level measure enzyme link immunosorbent assay elisa relationship vitamin d level psqi score analyze focus daytime dysfunction component psqi seven domain psqi daytime dysfunction domain strong statistical association serum vitamin d level p = 0.044 participant daytime dysfunction significantly high vitamin d level daytime dysfunction p = 0.04 significant association detect vitamin d level factor sex age high serum vitamin d level associate well sleep quality elderly individual particularly daytime dysfunction finding highlight potential importance maintain adequate vitamin d level promote healthy sleep pattern old adult
40555878,Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children with a history of febrile seizures: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"There exists a disagreement in the current literature on whether febrile seizures (FS) are associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This systematic review and meta-analysis was thus commenced to determine the association between childhood FS and ADHD and quantitatively measure its magnitude. This review was reported according to the PRISMA and MOOSE guideline. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Google Scholar, CINAHL, Scopus, and PsycINFO were systematically searched for observational studies reporting the occurrence of ADHD in patients with childhood FS. Then, unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were extracted from studies and pooled. The protocol for this review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024541299). Our meta-analysis included 12 studies with a total of 958,082 participants. FS was associated with 1.91 times greater odds of ADHD in the unadjusted analysis (95% CI = 1.32 to 2.76) and 2.68 times greater odds in the adjusted analysis (95% CI = 1.21 to 5.93). Subgroup and meta-regression analyses identified mean baseline age, follow-up duration, study aim, ADHD diagnostic criteria, study design, and region as moderators of the overall effect. In the present meta-analysis, a significant association between childhood FS and later ADHD was observed. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the association between the two disorders. Our findings contradict the common belief that FS are benign, thus suggesting that children with FS may benefit from closer developmental monitoring given the observed association with ADHD. • Febrile seizure (FS) is the most common type of seizure in childhood, affecting 2% to 5% in all infants and children between ages 6 through 60 months. • Several studies and guidelines have determined FS as a universally benign disorder, but in recent years, an increasing amount of literature has challenged this idea. • Our findings suggest a positive association between FS and ADHD, challenging the widely accepted belief that childhood FS is benign. • Subgroup analyses and meta-regression have identified study aim, ADHD diagnostic criteria, study design, region, mean age, and follow-up duration as factors that modify the overall effect.",European journal of pediatrics,2025.0,Hyunjun Woo; Sang-Ung Lee; Dahyeon Yun; Suha Jeong; Hyewon Cho; Yong-Sik Kim,"exist disagreement current literature febrile seizure fs associate adverse neurodevelopmental outcome attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd systematic review meta analysis commence determine association childhood fs adhd quantitatively measure magnitude review report accord prisma moose guideline pubmed embase web science google scholar cinahl scopus psycinfo systematically search observational study report occurrence adhd patient childhood fs unadjusted adjusted odd ratio 95 confidence interval ci extract study pool protocol review register prospero crd42024541299 meta analysis include 12 study total 958,082 participant fs associate 1.91 time great odd adhd unadjusted analysis 95 ci = 1.32 2.76 2.68 time great odd adjusted analysis 95 ci = 1.21 5.93 subgroup meta regression analysis identify mean baseline age follow duration study aim adhd diagnostic criterion study design region moderator overall effect present meta analysis significant association childhood fs later adhd observe knowledge systematic review meta analysis investigate association disorder finding contradict common belief fs benign suggest child fs benefit close developmental monitoring give observed association adhd febrile seizure fs common type seizure childhood affect 2 5 infant child age 6 60 month study guideline determine fs universally benign disorder recent year increase literature challenge idea finding suggest positive association fs adhd challenge widely accept belief childhood fs benign subgroup analysis meta regression identify study aim adhd diagnostic criterion study design region mean age follow duration factor modify overall effect"
40555874,Effectiveness of an online mindfulness-based stress-reduction intervention to reduce anxiety in breast cancer survivors: a randomized-controlled trial.,"This study evaluated the efficacy of an online mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention in reducing anxiety among breast cancer (BC) survivors, leveraging the potential advantages of digital delivery to enhance psychosocial care for this population. In this randomized controlled trial, 68 BC survivors with elevated anxiety levels were assigned to either an 8-week online MBSR intervention (n = 33) or a waitlist control group (n = 35). Anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), fatigue (FACIT-F), insomnia (ISI), cancer-related worry (CWS), vasomotor symptoms (MENQOL), and mindful awareness (MAAS) were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and at 5- and 8-months follow-up. Compared to the control group, MBSR participants showed significant reductions in anxiety (mean difference -4.13 points, 95CI -6.79 to -1.46, p = 0.003), depression (mean score difference -6.03, p < 0.001), fatigue (mean difference + 6.03, p = 0.002), insomnia (mean difference -3.97, p = 0.026), and cancer-related worry (mean difference -4.57, p = 0.003) at post-intervention, but no change in vasomotor symptoms (p > 0.05). MBSR participants also demonstrated increased mindful awareness (mean difference + 1.00, p = 0.004) that persisted through follow-up. The proportion of participants with clinically significant anxiety decreased from 96% pre-intervention to 38% at 8-months follow-up in the MBSR group, compared to relatively stable rates (88% to 87%) in the control group. Online MBSR is a potentially effective intervention for reducing anxiety and improving psychological well-being in BC survivors.

We aimed to assess bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS) in individuals with FD, and to explore correlations with disease severity. This retrospective study included all the patients with FD who performed at least one dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan at our institution during 2015-2023. Demographic and clinical data obtained from medical records included: medical treatment, anthropometric measurements, Functional Severity Scale (FuSS) score, balance assessment, the Brief Ataxia Rating Scale score, ambulation ability, blood test results and fracture history. Forty-one patients (21 males) had at least one DXA scan. The median age at the first scan was 25 years (range 7-47). The mean BMD Z-score was - 1.2 ± 1.5 at the lumbar spine and - 1.3 ± 1.1 at the bilateral proximal femur. The mean TBS Z-score was - 1.8 ± 1.6. The bilateral proximal femur BMD Z-score correlated with better scores of balance (r = 0.612, p = 0.001), ambulation (r = 0.627, p = 0.001) and ataxia (r = - 0.470, p = 0.015).

40555833,Granzyme K<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells slow tauopathy progression by targeting microglia.,"Neurodegenerative diseases activate innate and adaptive immune responses that can either slow or accelerate disease progression. Here, we sought to define beneficial immune pressures that emerge during tauopathy development in mice and humans. Using mice that express mutant human tau in neurons, we observed that microglia slowed tauopathy development by controlling the spread of phosphorylated tau (pTau) in the central nervous system and blood. However, over time microglia converted into distressed antigen-presenting cells, acquired neuronal transcripts and were targeted by resident, clonally expanded CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. These cells did not express traditional effector molecules, such as IFNγ, TNF or granzymes a/b/c, but instead deposited granzyme K (GZMK) onto microglia and were regulated by immune checkpoint proteins (TIGIT, PD-1), as blockade of TIGIT and PD-1 enhanced disease progression. GZMK<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells also targeted microglia in pTau-rich human brain lesions resulting from age, Alzheimer's disease or chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Deletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in mice promoted the emergence of distressed microglia containing neuronal transcripts, markedly enhanced pTau spread and accelerated neurological decline.

40555745,GSDME-mediated pyroptosis in microglia exacerbates demyelination and neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis: insights from humans and cuprizone-induced demyelination model mice.,"Demyelination, a hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS), disrupts neural conduction due to myelin sheath degradation. Microglia-mediated inflammation plays a pivotal role in this process, with emerging evidence implicating gasdermin E (GSDME) in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. However, the specific role of GSDME in MS remains unclear. Here, we investigated the involvement of GSDME in MS using brain tissues from MS patients and cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination model mice. We observed elevated GSDME expression in the central nervous system (CNS) lesions of MS patients, with pronounced GSDME cleavage in microglia at injury sites. Genetic knockout of Gsdme alleviated CPZ-induced motor deficits, demyelination, and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, caspase-3 inhibition significantly suppressed GSDME activation, resulting in reduced demyelination, motor coordination impairment, and neuroinflammation. In an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, caspase-3/GSDME-mediated microglial pyroptosis critically mediated the progression of neuroinflammation and white matter demyelination. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that GSDME regulated the expression of genes related to disease-associated microglia (DAMs) and impaired microglial autophagy, a process critical for myelin debris clearance. Gsdme knockout downregulated the expression of genes associated with DAMs and CPZ-induced microglia-driven demyelination while increasing the expression of remyelination-related genes (Cybb and Cd74). In vitro, GSDME suppression promoted microglial autophagy and myelin debris clearance. Collectively, our findings highlight GSDME-mediated pyroptosis as a key driver of demyelination and neuroinflammation in MS, suggesting novel therapeutic targets for neuroinflammatory disorders.",Cell death and differentiation,2025.0,Danjie Wang; Tongtong Zhang; Qi Shao; Xinyi Wu; Xiaoqiang Zhao; Hongyu Zhang; Yumeng Wang; Jingxian Sun; Xuechun Chang; Keying Zhu; Shuai Wu; Li Cao; Wankun Chen; Jun Wang,demyelination hallmark multiple sclerosis ms disrupt neural conduction myelin sheath degradation microglia mediate inflammation play pivotal role process emerge evidence implicate gasdermin e gsdme neuroinflammation neurodegeneration specific role gsdme ms remain unclear investigate involvement gsdme ms brain tissue ms patient cuprizone cpz)-induce demyelination model mouse observe elevated gsdme expression central nervous system cns lesion ms patient pronounced gsdme cleavage microglia injury site genetic knockout gsdme alleviate cpz induce motor deficit demyelination neuroinflammation furthermore caspase-3 inhibition significantly suppress gsdme activation result reduce demyelination motor coordination impairment neuroinflammation experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis eae model caspase-3 gsdme mediate microglial pyroptosis critically mediate progression neuroinflammation white matter demyelination transcriptome sequencing reveal gsdme regulate expression gene relate disease associate microglia dams impair microglial autophagy process critical myelin debris clearance gsdme knockout downregulate expression gene associate dam cpz induce microglia drive demyelination increase expression remyelination relate gene cybb cd74 vitro gsdme suppression promote microglial autophagy myelin debris clearance collectively finding highlight gsdme mediate pyroptosis key driver demyelination neuroinflammation ms suggest novel therapeutic target neuroinflammatory disorder

Included were all published double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of these agents. Outcomes included subjective time to sleep onset at month 1 (sTSO, primary), subjective total sleep time at month 1 (sTST, co-primary), subjective wake after sleep onset at month 1, Insomnia Severity Index scores at month 1, all-cause discontinuation, discontinuation due to adverse events, and the incidence of individual adverse events such as somnolence, dizziness, falls, headache, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infection. This meta-analysis included eight trials (5198 adults, average age = 56.33 years, 67.84% female). The treatment arms included daridorexant 25 mg/day (DAR25), daridorexant 50 mg/day (DAR50), lemborexant 5 mg/day (LEM5), lemborexant 10 mg/day (LEM10), suvorexant 20 mg/day (15 mg/day for people ≥65years, SUV20/15), and placebo.

40555725,"Not just old wine in new bottles: Polygenic liability for ADHD is associated with electrophysiological affective-motivational processing beyond anxiety, depression, and ODD.","In attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), emotional features account for heterogeneity and exacerbate severity of behavioral and functional impairments, beyond cognitive and comorbidity features. Yet, debate remains about the extent to which, in ADHD, such emotional features are a ""core feature"", i.e. whether ADHD should be conceptualized as encompassing difficulties with regulating not only activity, attention, and impulses but also processing and regulating emotions. We aimed to address this issue by examining the extent to which in adolescents, ADHD polygenic scores (PGSs) are associated with electrophysiological indices of affective-motivational processing, measured during a monetary punishment/reward feedback paradigm.

40555718,Predicting individual treatment response in alcohol use disorders: a reverse translational proof-of-concept study.,"The development of medications for alcohol use disorders (AUD) faces stagnation, as promising drugs failed to translate in clinic. Screening on homogeneous groups of animals drugs later tested on heterogeneous clinical cohorts may contribute to the translational gap. We hypothesized that a preclinical model of AUD accounting for inter-individual heterogeneity would predict the lack of efficacy of a drug that failed clinical trials (Memantine) and the efficacy of an approved AUD medication (Naltrexone). Baseline alcohol drinking, motivation, and cued reinstatement were screened in NIH genetically heterogeneous-stock rats before testing the effect of Memantine and Naltrexone on alcohol (ASA) and saccharin self-administration (SSA). Based on the individual effect of Memantine and Naltrexone on ASA, rats were allocated into independent clusters of responders and non-responders to each drug. The same doses of Memantine reduced both ASA and SSA in both clusters, while Naltrexone selectively reduced ASA in responder rats. Naltrexone responders were in majority males, while non-responders were mostly females. Naltrexone responders and non-responders showed similar alcohol drinking and motivation, but non-responders did not show cued reinstatement of alcohol seeking. In line with clinical observations, in a model accounting for individual heterogeneity Memantine failed to selectively reduce ASA, the population could be unbiasedly clustered in responders and non-responders, and cued reactivity associated with Naltrexone response in males. These results advocate the use of inter-individual heterogeneity for preclinical prediction of drug efficacy in AUD before clinical trials.

Candidate variants were validated by Sanger sequencing, followed by bioinformatics analysis, American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) Standards and Guidelines for the Interpretation of Sequence Variants pathogenicity classification, and protein structure prediction. A literature search with ""Coats Plus syndrome"" or ""Cerebroretinal microangiopathy with calcifications and cysts"" as keywords was conducted at PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang databases to include recently published studies (up to December 2023). This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Hunan Children's Hospital (Ethics No. KY2020-07). Informed consent for clinical research was obtained from the guardian of the child. The proband was a 10-year-10-month-old boy. The clinical manifestations were intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, liver fibrosis, panhemopenia, bilateral exudative retinopathy, intracranial lesions and facial pigmentation. WES and Sanger sequencing revealed two novel heterozygous variants in the CTC1 gene: c.787G>A (p.Val263Met) in exon 5 and c.2930C>G (p.Ser977Cys) in exon 17, which were inherited from his mother and father, respectively. According to ACMG pathogenicity classification, both missense variants were classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Protein structure prediction showed the absence of LIG_SH3_3 motif and LIG_SH3_3 motif, and the p.Ser977Cys mutation may affect the binding between CST (CTC1-STN1-TEN) complex and DNA strand. The child had continued to experience recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding episodes despite propranolol treatment, but the condition was controlled after liver transplantation. According to the predefined literature search strategy of this study, a total of 10 relevant articles on pediatric CRMCC patients were retrieved, involving 11 children with gastrointestinal bleeding. Pharmacological and endoscopic therapies play a certain role in the management of CRMCC children complicated with gastrointestinal bleeding. The CTC1 gene c.787G>A and c.2930C>G variants probably underlay CRMCC in this child.

A child with NFNS who was treated at the Department of Endocrinology of Hangzhou Children's Hospital in January 2024 was selected as the study subject. Clinical data of the child was collected by retrospective analysis. Peripheral venous blood samples (2 mL each) were collected from the child and his parents. Genomic DNA was extracted, and trio-whole exome sequencing (Trio-WES) of the family was carried out. Sanger sequencing was used to perform family verification on the candidate variants. The identified variants were classified for pathogenicity according to the Standards and Guidelines for the Interpretation of Sequence Variants established by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) (hereafter referred to as the ""ACMG guidelines""). This study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Hangzhou Children's Hospital (Ethics No. 2021-06). The child was a 7-year and 4-month-old male. He has short stature, numerous café-au-lait spots on the neck and trunk, and special facial features such as a full forehead, wide interpupillary distance, a low nasal bridge, and low-set ears. The results of Trio-WES showed that the he had harbored the NF1 gene c.3773G>T (p.W1258L) mutation, which was verified by Sanger sequencing to be de novo in origin.

Clinical data of pregnant women with fetus at a high risk for trisomy/monosomy 13 by NIPT at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from May 2016 to May 2024 were reviewed, and relevant data such as Z-score, positive predictive value (PPV) and fetal fraction (FF) were analyzed to assess the correlation between them. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital (No. 2018-YB-08). 71 fetuses were found to have a high risk by NIPT, including 58 cases for trisomy 13 (T13) and 13 cases for monosomy 13 (M13). 52 women had opted invasive prenatal diagnosis and 13 cases were confirmed, which yielded a positive prediction value (PPV) of 25%. 12 fetuses were confirmed as T13 (PPV = 29.3%; 12/41), 1 was confirmed as M13 (PPV = 9.1%; 1/11). The PPV had increased along with the Z-score. Fetal faction (FF) was not correlated with the age of woman but gestational age, and was negatively correlated with the body mass index. No statistical difference was found in FF and Z-score between true- and false-positive fetuses, and there was a weak correlation between the Z-score and FF. The PPV of the NIPT could be improved by combining the results of ultrasonography. The high false positive rate for T13 may be related to confined placental mosaicism, PPV is related to the Z-score, which in turn is related to FF. High-risk women are strongly recommended to undergo genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis.

Yet, the causes of post-COVID-19 dizziness are still largely unclear. This paper presents a case of a patient in his 40s who developed persistent dizziness after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Dizziness only occurred during nasal respiration. Inspection of the tympanic membrane on respiration indicated a patulous eustachian tube (PET). Video-oculography showed a slight nystagmus during nasal respiration. Placement of a tympanostomy tube 6 months after the start of symptoms immediately resolved the dizziness, and nystagmus during nasal respiration was reduced. A few days after treatment, the patient developed ocular fatigue and pain associated with eye movement, which was diagnosed as vestibular asthenopia.

40555519,A positive allosteric modulator of the SERCA pump rescues hippocampal neuronal circuits dysfunction and cognitive defects in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that affects normal neuronal functioning, alters neuronal circuits activity and memory formation and storage. Disrupted neuronal calcium (Ca²⁺) signaling is one of the drivers of AD pathogenesis. Previously we suggested that positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA) pump may help to stabilize cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and exert neuroprotective effects in AD neurons. In the current manuscript we demonstrate synaptoprotective properties of several SERCA PAMs using an <i>in vitro</i> model of amyloid toxicity. Based on <i>in vitro</i> experiments, we selected the SERCA PAM NDC-9009 for in vivo evaluation in male and female 5xFAD transgenic mice model of Alzheimer's disease. Using the miniscope imaging technique, we observed hyperactivity and abnormal connectivity of hippocampal neuronal ensembles 5xFAD mice. We further discovered that the function of the hippocampal neuronal circuits in 5xFAD mice was normalized by NDC-9009 intraperitoneal administration. NDC-9009 intraperitoneal administration also rescued memory defects in 5xFAD mice as quantified by the fear conditioning behavioral test and significantly reduced accumulation of amyloid plaques in hippocampal region of these mice. The obtained results support the potential utility of NDC-9009 and other SERCA PAMs as lead molecules for development of disease-modifying treatments for AD and potentially other neurodegenerative disorders.<b>Significance statement</b> Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a significant medical and social burden, yet no treatment currently exists. One of the hallmarks of AD is disrupted Ca²⁺ signaling, which contributes to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. In the current study, we demonstrate the potential of the SERCA pump positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) as promising disease-modifying agents. Through an <i>in vitro</i> screening, we identified NDC-9009 as the most effective SERCA PAM, promoting robust cytosolic calcium clearance and exhibiting neuroprotective properties. Furthermore, using miniature fluorescence in vivo imaging, a significant restoration of hippocampal neuronal ensembles activity and cognitive function after chronic administration of NDC-9009 in the transgenic AD mouse model was demonstrated<b>.</b>",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2025.0,Evgenii Gerasimov; Anastasiya Rakovskaya; Ekaterina Pchitskaya; Olga Vlasova; Russell Dahl; Ilya Bezprozvanny,alzheimer disease ad common neurodegenerative disorder affect normal neuronal functioning alter neuronal circuit activity memory formation storage disrupt neuronal calcium ca²⁺ signal driver ad pathogenesis previously suggest positive allosteric modulator pam sarco endoplasmic reticulum < sup>2+</sup > atpase serca pump help stabilize cytosolic < sup>2+</sup > level exert neuroprotective effect ad neuron current manuscript demonstrate synaptoprotective property serca pam < > vitro</i > model amyloid toxicity base < > vitro</i > experiment select serca pam ndc-9009 vivo evaluation male female 5xfad transgenic mice model alzheimer disease miniscope imaging technique observe hyperactivity abnormal connectivity hippocampal neuronal ensemble 5xfad mouse discover function hippocampal neuronal circuit 5xfad mouse normalize ndc-9009 intraperitoneal administration ndc-9009 intraperitoneal administration rescue memory defect 5xfad mouse quantify fear condition behavioral test significantly reduce accumulation amyloid plaque hippocampal region mouse obtain result support potential utility ndc-9009 serca pam lead molecule development disease modify treatment ad potentially neurodegenerative disorders.<b > significance statement</b > alzheimer disease ad significant medical social burden treatment currently exist hallmark ad disrupt ca²⁺ signaling contribute neuronal dysfunction degeneration current study demonstrate potential serca pump positive allosteric modulator pam promise disease modify agent < > vitro</i > screening identify ndc-9009 effective serca pam promote robust cytosolic calcium clearance exhibit neuroprotective property furthermore miniature fluorescence vivo imaging significant restoration hippocampal neuronal ensemble activity cognitive function chronic administration ndc-9009 transgenic ad mouse model demonstrate < b>.</b >
40555516,Neural and Behavioral Markers of Negative Symptoms and Cognitive Impairment in Patients with Psychosis.,"Negative and cognitive symptoms impair functioning in patients with psychotic illnesses (i.e., schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SZ) and bipolar I disorder with psychotic features (BD)). Disruptions in mesocorticolimbic circuitry are hypothesized to underpin negative symptoms and cognitive impairment in patients with psychosis and may also facilitate reward-motivational deficits. In male and female patients with psychosis (N=44) and healthy controls (HC=27), we used neuroimaging to define gray matter morphology and white matter microstructure. We examined negative symptom severity with the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), effort allocation during reward processing with the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT), and cognitive performance with the MATRICS Cognitive Consensus Battery (MCCB). Reduced nucleus accumbens volumes in patients with psychosis were associated to higher CAINS total and Motivation and Pleasure subscale scores as well as lower effort expenditure for medium (50%) and high (88%) reward probability conditions during the EEfRT. The fornix showed reduced fractional anisotropy in patients with psychosis. Negative associations were present between CAINS Motivation and Pleasure subscores and MCCB composite and subscale scores. Lower gray matter volume in cerebellar lobule VI corresponded with impaired effort allocation during medium and high reward probability conditions and lower cognitive performance. However, lobule VI was not correlated with CAINS scores. While nucleus accumbens volume may serve as marker of negative symptoms in psychotic illnesses, cerebellar lobule VI morphology may inform on cognitive impairment in patients with SZ and BD. The nucleus accumbens and lobule VI may each contribute to reduced effort allocation during reward processing.<b>Significance Statement</b> Improving negative symptoms and cognitive impairment in SZ and BD remains an unmet clinical need. This study reveals that, in SZ and BD, structural changes in the nucleus accumbens and cerebellar lobule VI are associated with negative symptoms and cognitive impairments, respectively. The current findings also suggest that reductions in nucleus accumbens and cerebellar lobule VI volume may also underpin impaired reduced effort allocation during reward processing. This study provides impetus for further probing supratentorial and cerebellar circuitry to further understand negative and cognitive symptoms experienced by patients with psychotic illness and their associations with reward-motivational deficits.",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2025.0,Raquel van Gool; Mariesa Cay; Hanne van der Heijden; Emma Golden; Amanda Cao; Boyu Ren; Joseph Gonzalez-Heydrich; Ann K Shinn; Jaymin Upadhyay,negative cognitive symptom impair function patient psychotic illness i.e. schizophrenia spectrum disorder sz bipolar disorder psychotic feature bd disruption mesocorticolimbic circuitry hypothesize underpin negative symptom cognitive impairment patient psychosis facilitate reward motivational deficit male female patient psychosis n=44 healthy control hc=27 neuroimage define gray matter morphology white matter microstructure examine negative symptom severity clinical assessment interview negative symptoms cains effort allocation reward process effort expenditure rewards task eefrt cognitive performance matrics cognitive consensus battery mccb reduced nucleus accumben volume patient psychosis associate high cains total motivation pleasure subscale score low effort expenditure medium 50 high 88 reward probability condition eefrt fornix show reduce fractional anisotropy patient psychosis negative association present cains motivation pleasure subscore mccb composite subscale score low gray matter volume cerebellar lobule vi correspond impaired effort allocation medium high reward probability condition low cognitive performance lobule vi correlate cain score nucleus accumben volume serve marker negative symptom psychotic illness cerebellar lobule vi morphology inform cognitive impairment patient sz bd nucleus accumben lobule vi contribute reduced effort allocation reward processing.<b > significance statement</b > improve negative symptom cognitive impairment sz bd remain unmet clinical need study reveal sz bd structural change nucleus accumben cerebellar lobule vi associate negative symptom cognitive impairment respectively current finding suggest reduction nucleus accumben cerebellar lobule vi volume underpin impair reduce effort allocation reward processing study provide impetus probe supratentorial cerebellar circuitry understand negative cognitive symptom experience patient psychotic illness association reward motivational deficit
40555507,Digital interventions for common mental health problems among older adults in low- and middle-income countries: a scoping review.,"The proportion of older adults is projected to rise dramatically in most parts of the world, and in 2050, 80% of all older adults (≥65 years) will reside in low- and middle-income countries. Developing digital interventions tailored to this population will be a crucial part in appropriately addressing the challenges associated with the upcoming demographic changes. The objective of this scoping review was to map all published research on digital interventions for common mental health problems among older adults conducted in low- and middle-income countries. We conducted a literature search in four databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Cochrane Library) and conducted hand searches of existing reviews and reference lists of included studies. Eligibility criteria were that (1) the study investigated or discussed digital interventions for common mental health problems (depression, anxiety, sleep problems and/or substance use problems), (2) the study concerned older adults (at least 60 years or older), (3) the study was conducted in a low- or middle-income country and (4) the study was published in English in a peer-reviewed academic journal. Two reviewers independently screened, reviewed and extracted data. Out of 1344 identified studies, 6 were included. The hand searches rendered no additional studies, leaving a total of six included studies. Four of these studies included quantitative data: of these, three were randomised controlled trials and one was a feasibility study. All focused on depression/loneliness and were published in middle-income countries (South Africa, Brazil and Turkey), and showed promising results in terms of reductions in social isolation and depression. In addition, two expert opinions had been published, both also conducted in a middle-income country (India). Despite the projected demographic transition, surprisingly little research appears to have been conducted on digital interventions for common mental health disorders among older adults in low- and middle-income countries. https://osf.io/bmdnv Open Science Framework.",BMJ global health,2025.0,Indranil Saha; Christopher Sundström; Arun Kandasamy; Martin Kraepelien; Neha Dayia; Asim Saha; Nitya Jayaram-Lindström; Amit Chakrabarti; Vivek Benegal,proportion old adult project rise dramatically part world 2050 80 old adult ≥65 year reside low- middle income country develop digital intervention tailor population crucial appropriately address challenge associate upcoming demographic change objective scoping review map publish research digital intervention common mental health problem old adult conduct low- middle income country conduct literature search database pubmed embase scopus cochrane library conduct hand search exist review reference list include study eligibility criterion 1 study investigate discuss digital intervention common mental health problem depression anxiety sleep problem and/or substance use problem 2 study concern old adult 60 year old 3 study conduct low- middle income country 4 study publish english peer review academic journal reviewer independently screen review extract datum 1344 identify study 6 include hand search render additional study leave total include study study include quantitative datum randomise control trial feasibility study focus depression loneliness publish middle income country south africa brazil turkey show promising result term reduction social isolation depression addition expert opinion publish conduct middle income country india despite project demographic transition surprisingly little research appear conduct digital intervention common mental health disorder old adult low- middle income country https://osf.io/bmdnv open science framework
40555502,"Best practice for tobacco smoking policies within an acute substance use disorder care facility: considerations from a withdrawal management setting in British Columbia, Canada.","Smoking-related illness has historically been a major cause of death in persons with substance use disorders. Smoking cessation has the potential to support improved substance use disorder outcomes, as well as improved physical and mental health outcomes in persons receiving other substance use disorder treatment. However, tobacco abstinence-oriented policies within substance use disorder care settings may create barriers to clients who are uninterested in quitting smoking being able to access other potentially lifesaving substance use disorder treatment. In British Columbia, where the drug toxicity crisis has become the leading cause of unnatural death, reducing barriers to accessing substance use disorder treatment is a key public health priority. We present a <b>reflection on considerations from a withdrawal management setting</b> of a smoking policy change within that facility and review the potential benefits and harms of permissive smoking policies within substance use disorder care environments. Benefits include the elimination of a barrier to accessing other substance use treatment, patient autonomy over participation in smoking cessation treatment and the potential for less covert smoking and associated risks. Risks include ongoing physical and mental health harms of smoking, potentially poorer other substance use treatment outcomes, risks of tobacco relapse to other clients and secondhand smoke exposure to staff and other clients.

40555488,[Mechanisms of enhanced noise susceptibility in waardenburg syndrome <i>Sox10 p.S100Rfs*9</i> mutant mice].,"<b>Objective:</b>To investigate the impact of Waardenburg syndrome（WS） -associated <i>Sox10 p.S100Rfs*9</i> mutation on inner ear function and its mechanism in noise-induced hearing impairment. <b>Methods:</b>A mice model carrying the <i>Sox10 p.S100Rfs*9</i> mutation was established using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology. Auditory phenotypes were assessed under baseline conditions and after noise exposure（96 dB SPL, 2 hours）. Auditory brainstem response（ABR） tests were performed to evaluate hearing function, combined with immunofluorescence staining of cochlear basilar membrane whole-mounts to observe hair cells and ribbon synapses. Transcriptome sequencing was conducted to analyze molecular mechanisms. <b>Results:</b><i>Sox10 p.S100Rfs*9</i> heterozygous mice exhibited normal hearing thresholds with characteristic ventral pigmentation abnormalities under baseline conditions. Following noise exposure, mutant mice showed significantly higher ABR thresholds at 24 000 Hz compared to wild-type controls（[60.00±6.12]vs[48.13±4.28]dB SPL, <i>P</i><0.000 1）, and a significant reduction in ribbon synapses（CtBP2-positive puncta） in the basal turn（[55.0±2.3]vs[64.8±3.3]per inner hair cell, <i>P</i>=0.006 6）, while hair cell morphology and number remained intact. Transcriptome analysis revealed altered expression of genes involved in immune regulation, membrane structures, ion channels, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions. <b>Conclusion:</b>The <i>Sox10 p.S100Rfs*9</i> mutation does not alter baseline hearing function but significantly increases inner ear susceptibility to noise damage, primarily manifested as enhanced ribbon synapse vulnerability, especially in high-frequency regions. This gene-environment interaction reveals that <i>Sox10</i> haploinsufficiency may compromise noise tolerance by affecting synaptic stability and inner ear protective mechanisms.

40555479,Associations between neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage and psychological distress among Australian adults: longitudinal analysis of the HILDA survey (2007-2021).,"Mental disorders contribute substantially to the global burden of disease. The neighbourhood socioeconomic environment is a key determinant of mental health, even after accounting for individual-level socioeconomic factors. However, few longitudinal studies have examined this relationship. This study examined longitudinal associations between neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage and psychological distress from three perspectives: overall associations, trends over time and changing neighbourhood exposures. Data were from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey wave 7 (2007) to wave 21 (2021), a nationally representative household-based cohort study, including 109 604 observations. Mental health was assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), analysed as a continuous variable, score range 10-50. Neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage was measured using derived spatially and temporally consistent census-based data, analysed in quintiles. Multilevel and fixed effects linear regression models were used. Psychological distress increased with neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage, with K10 scores 1.35 points higher (95% CI 1.14 to 1.55) in the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods compared with the least. However, the rate of change in distress over time did not vary by neighbourhood disadvantage. An association was observed between changes in disadvantage and changes in psychological distress for the most socioeconomically disadvantaged neighbourhoods. The findings from nationally representative longitudinal data show that individuals living in more disadvantaged neighbourhoods consistently experienced higher psychological distress compared with those in less disadvantaged neighbourhoods. These inequalities remained stable over time, and limited evidence of change suggests that the association may reflect persistent differences between individuals living in different neighbourhoods.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2025.0,Rebecca A Reid; Suzanne Mavoa; Julia Gilmartin-Thomas; Sarah Foster; Jerome N Rachele,mental disorder contribute substantially global burden disease neighbourhood socioeconomic environment key determinant mental health account individual level socioeconomic factor longitudinal study examine relationship study examine longitudinal association neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage psychological distress perspective overall association trend time change neighbourhood exposure datum household income labour dynamics australia survey wave 7 2007 wave 21 2021 nationally representative household base cohort study include 109 604 observation mental health assess kessler psychological distress scale k10 analyse continuous variable score range 10 50 neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage measure derive spatially temporally consistent census base datum analyse quintile multilevel fix effect linear regression model psychological distress increase neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage k10 score 1.35 point high 95 ci 1.14 1.55 disadvantaged neighbourhood compare rate change distress time vary neighbourhood disadvantage association observe change disadvantage change psychological distress socioeconomically disadvantaged neighbourhood finding nationally representative longitudinal datum individual live disadvantaged neighbourhood consistently experience high psychological distress compare disadvantaged neighbourhood inequality remain stable time limited evidence change suggest association reflect persistent difference individual live different neighbourhood

40555472,Inhibition of spreading depolarizations by targeting GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and voltage-gated sodium channels improves neurological deficits in rats with traumatic brain injury.,"Spreading depolarizations (SDs) are frequently observed in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Current research on inhibiting SDs primarily focuses on single targets; however, the efficacy and safety of this approach remain controversial. Effects of a novel compound, CTMB, on both GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and voltage-regulated sodium channels (Na<sub>V</sub>s) was assessed by whole-cell patch-clamp experiments. Protection against mechanical scratch injury by CTMB or d-bicuculline, a competitive GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonist, was assessed using cultures of HT22 cells. In vivo, short- and long-term neurobehavioural performance of male Sprague-Dawley rats were evaluated following treatment with different doses of CTMB, 2 h after TBI. Western blots, RT-qPCR and immunohistochemical assays were used to explore mechanisms underlying the effects of CTMB. CTMB was an allosteric agonist at GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and inhibited Na<sub>V</sub>s, thereby increasing the threshold for SDs and potentially suppressing their initiation and propagation. During the subacute phase, CTMB restored the balance between excitation and inhibition, preventing neuron injury and loss by suppressing mitochondria-involved apoptosis. In the recovery phase, CTMB promoted synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus by activating the BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway. In TBI rats, CTMB enhanced neurological function, reducing epilepsy incidence and mortality, and prolonging survival times. Targeting both Na<sub>V</sub>s and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors can overcome limitations associated with single-target approaches, providing valuable insights and critical clues for drug discovery in TBI and offering a promising therapeutic strategy for other neurological disorders involving SDs, such as stroke and subarachnoid haemorrhage.",British journal of pharmacology,2025.0,Ruijie Yan; Qi Liu; Di Zhang; Kai Li; Yue Li; Yao Nie; Yingying Zhang; Pengyu Li; Shengjun Mao; Hui Li,spread depolarization sds frequently observe patient traumatic brain injury tbi current research inhibit sd primarily focus single target efficacy safety approach remain controversial effect novel compound ctmb gaba < sub > a</sub > receptor voltage regulate sodium channel na < sub > v</sub > s assess cell patch clamp experiment protection mechanical scratch injury ctmb d bicuculline competitive gaba < sub > a</sub > antagonist assess culture ht22 cell vivo short- long term neurobehavioural performance male sprague dawley rat evaluate follow treatment different dose ctmb 2 h tbi western blot rt qpcr immunohistochemical assay explore mechanism underlie effect ctmb ctmb allosteric agonist gaba < sub > a</sub > receptor inhibited na < sub > v</sub > s increase threshold sd potentially suppress initiation propagation subacute phase ctmb restore balance excitation inhibition prevent neuron injury loss suppress mitochondria involve apoptosis recovery phase ctmb promote synaptogenesis synaptic plasticity hippocampus activate bdnf trkb creb pathway tbi rat ctmb enhance neurological function reduce epilepsy incidence mortality prolong survival time target na < sub > v</sub > s gaba < sub > a</sub > receptor overcome limitation associate single target approach provide valuable insight critical clue drug discovery tbi offer promising therapeutic strategy neurological disorder involve sd stroke subarachnoid haemorrhage
40555467,Long-Read Sequencing Expands the Genotypic Spectrum of Patients With Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II.,"The substantial genetic heterogeneity associated with mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II) poses major challenges to current genetic testing. A comprehensive analysis of MPS II (CAMPS II), integrating long-range PCR with long-read sequencing (LRS), was established to identify IDS variants in 92 patients with clinically suspected MPS II. Comparative analysis against conventional genetic testing including multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and Sanger sequencing revealed concordant results in 75% (69/92) of cases, with discordant results in 25% (23/92) of cases. Among 23 discordant cases, CAMPS II newly identified IDS variants in 18 patients and enhanced variant detection in five patients. The diagnostic yield of CAMPS II for pathogenic variants was 82.6% (76/92), significantly higher than 66.3% (61/92) with conventional methods.

40555455,Effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation on perioperative neurocognitive dysfunction: study protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.,"Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNDs), a common postoperative complication associated with anaesthesia and surgical procedures, are characterised by impairments in memory, attention, language comprehension and social functioning. Accumulating evidence from clinical studies indicates that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-a non-invasive neuromodulatory modality capable of targeted cortical stimulation-may offer therapeutic promise for PND management. To comprehensively assess the intervention efficacy and safety parameters of TMS in mitigating postoperative cognitive decline, we propose conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Our findings aim to provide evidence-based insights into the neuroprotective potential of TMS for mitigating cognitive decline in surgical populations. The investigation will implement a multifaceted search protocol encompassing international and Chinese scholarly resources. The search will be conducted in major databases, including Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, China Biology Medicine, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wan Fang Database and Chinese Scientific Journal Database from inception to 31 March 2025. To capture the latest research trends, ongoing trials will be simultaneously searched in the WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov and the China Clinical Trial Registry. Grey literature will be supplemented through resources such as GreyNet International, OpenGrey and Google Scholar. The inclusion criteria for this review are restricted to randomised controlled trials investigating the application of TMS as an intervention for PND. Primary endpoints comprise clinically confirmed incidence rates of postoperative delirium and delayed neurocognitive recovery. Two researchers will independently perform literature screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment. The risk of bias in included studies will be evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0. Evidence certainty will be appraised through the GRADE framework with explicit justification for downgrading decisions. Meta-analysis will be conducted using STATA V.15.1 statistical software. The data synthesis process will incorporate standardised methodologies, including heterogeneity testing, sensitivity analysis and assessment of publication bias. This study will not involve the collection of biometric information or medical privacy data throughout the research process, thus complying with the exemption criteria outlined in the 'Measures for Ethical Review of Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects.' The findings will adhere to academic standards and be submitted for publication in reputable international medical journals following a rigorous double-blind peer-review process.

40555449,Prevalence of autism among adults in Canada: results from a simulation modelling study.,"To estimate the prevalence of autism among adults living in Canada. A Monte Carlo simulation modelling approach was employed. Input parameters included adult population estimates and mortality rates; autism population all-cause mortality risk ratios; and autism prevalence estimates derived from child and youth data due to the lack of adult data. This approach was executed through 10 000 simulations, with each iteration generating a distinct data scenario. Prevalence estimates were reported as the mean with the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles, corresponding to a 95% simulation interval (SI). Where possible, Canadian data sources were used, including the 2019 Canadian Health Survey on Children and Youth and Statistics Canada mortality rates and population estimates. National prevalence estimates of autistic adults living in private dwellings in Canada, with variations in prevalence by sex at birth and province/territory considered. The findings suggest the prevalence of autism among adults in Canada to be 1.8% (95% SI 1.6%, 2.0%). National prevalence estimates by sex at birth were 0.7% (95% SI 0.6%, 0.9%) for females and 2.9% (95% SI 2.6%, 3.2%) for males. Provincial/territorial estimates ranged from 0.7% in Saskatchewan (95% SI 0.3%, 1.3%) to 3.6% in New Brunswick (95% SI 2.4%, 5.1%). The limited availability of data on autistic adults constrains our ability to fully understand and address their unique needs. In this study, autism prevalence was estimated based on diagnosed cases, which excludes individuals without a formal diagnosis. Additionally, other factors such as data availability and methodological assumptions may influence the modelling of prevalence estimates. As a result, our findings should be interpreted within the context of these limitations. Nevertheless, this study provides a valuable reference point for understanding autism prevalence among adults in Canada.",BMJ open,2025.0,Erin Collins; Rojiemiahd Edjoc; Amy Farrow; Christoffer Dharma; Stelios Georgiades; Kieran Holmes; Christa Orchard; Siobhan O'Donnell; Sarah Palmeter; Mackenzie Salt; Ahmed Al-Jaishi,estimate prevalence autism adult live canada monte carlo simulation modelling approach employ input parameter include adult population estimate mortality rate autism population cause mortality risk ratio autism prevalence estimate derive child youth datum lack adult datum approach execute 10 000 simulation iteration generate distinct datum scenario prevalence estimate report mean 2.5th 97.5th percentile correspond 95 simulation interval si possible canadian data source include 2019 canadian health survey children youth statistics canada mortality rate population estimate national prevalence estimate autistic adult live private dwelling canada variation prevalence sex birth province territory consider finding suggest prevalence autism adult canada 1.8 95 si 1.6 2.0 national prevalence estimate sex birth 0.7 95 si 0.6 0.9 female 2.9 95 si 2.6 3.2 male provincial territorial estimate range 0.7 saskatchewan 95 si 0.3 1.3 3.6 new brunswick 95 si 2.4 5.1 limited availability datum autistic adult constrain ability fully understand address unique need study autism prevalence estimate base diagnose case exclude individual formal diagnosis additionally factor datum availability methodological assumption influence modelling prevalence estimate result finding interpret context limitation study provide valuable reference point understand autism prevalence adult canada
40555446,Randomised trial of home sleep apnoea testing compared to in-lab polysomnography for the evaluation of obstructive sleep apnoea in children: rationale and study protocol.,"Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) affects 1-5% of the paediatric population, including 55-90% of children with Down syndrome (DS), and has been associated with negative effects on neurocognitive development, cardiovascular health, immune development and quality of life. In-lab attended polysomnography (PSG) is currently the gold standard for the diagnosis of OSA in children, but it poses challenges due to the burden on families and limited testing facilities. Home sleep apnoea testing (HSAT), an unattended sleep test done at home, is an accepted alternative for adults but lacks sufficient evidence to be used clinically for the evaluation of OSA in children. HSAT may be especially beneficial for children with DS or others with sensory issues or those who struggle with sleeping in a laboratory setting overnight. This single-centre trial compares HSAT to PSG for the diagnosis of OSA in children, including those with DS. The trial will enrol 317 children 5-12 years old, including approximately 100 with DS. The primary outcome is the diagnostic accuracy of HSAT compared with PSG for OSA evaluated through ROC. Secondary outcomes include the agreement between HSAT and PSG for therapeutic decision-making and comparison of preference and acceptability of HSAT versus PSG. This trial seeks to evaluate HSAT as an alternative diagnostic tool for paediatric OSA, potentially expanding testing options for clinicians and families.

40555440,"Prognostic nutritional index in the prediction of adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Urumqi, China: a retrospective cohort study.","Prognostic nutritional index (PNI) is an index for assessing nutritional and immune status. The aim of this study is to investigate the predictive value of PNI for long-term major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This retrospective cohort study analysed 1582 STEMI patients with T2DM who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention from January 2015 to June 2023 in Urumqi, China. Patients were followed up for MACCE. The primary endpoint was new-onset MACCE including all-cause death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. This study ultimately included 1582 patients for analysis with a median follow-up period of 48 months (IQR: 24-84 months) and 282 patients (17.8%) developed MACCE. Of them, 138 (8.7%), 84 (5.3%) and 60 (3.8%) patients developed all-cause death, a non-fatal MI and a non-fatal stroke, respectively. Incidences of MACCE and all-cause death conversely correlated with PNI. Kaplan-Meier curves showed a significant difference in all components of MACCE between PNI quartiles (p<0.001). The multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that PNI was an independent predictor of MACCE (adjusted HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.93 to 0.97, p<0.001) and all-cause death (adjusted HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.97, p<0.001). The optimal PNI cut-off for predicting MACCE and all-cause death was 45.10 and 45.09, respectively. Moreover, the addition of PNI to the traditional prognostic model for MACCE improved the C-statistic value (p<0.001). PNI, a simple and easily obtainable index, was independently associated with MACCE and all-cause death in this study.

Thirty-one care staff members from elderly care facilities in Japan used the application during ABA-based consultations and evaluated its usability using a 10-item Likert scale. While overall ease of use was rated positively, differences were observed in participants' willingness to use it regularly and in their perception of how much they needed to learn to use it effectively. Stepwise multiple regression analysis using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) identified age, caregiving experience, and digital device usage as significant predictors of usability.

Disruption of iron homeostasis is associated with cognitive impairment. This study aimed to explore the relationship between brain iron deposition and cognitive impairment in patients with PD and HD by using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). The cross-sectional study enrolled 56 PD patients, 66 HD patients, and 56 age-sex matched healthy controls. All participants underwent QSM to measure brain iron content and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to assess cognitive function. In addition, relevant biochemical indicators were collected and analyzed. The ANOVA was used to test for differences in susceptibility value among bilateral caudate nuclei (CAU), thalamus (THA), putamen and pallidum. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to investigate the relationships between susceptibility value and clinical laboratory parameters or MoCA score. Compared with HC, PD patients showed higher susceptibility value in bilateral CAU and left THA. Compared with HD patients, PD patients showed higher susceptibility value in left THA.

40555137,NOVA1/2 genes and alternative splicing in neurodevelopment.,"NOVA1 and NOVA2 are neuron-specific RNA-binding proteins essential for alternative splicing (AS), influencing neurodevelopment by regulating transcript diversity. These proteins recognize YCAY sequences on pre-mRNA, regulating exon inclusion or skipping, intron retention, and alternative polyadenylation. Despite their 75% sequence identity, NOVA1 and NOVA2 exhibit distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns and target specificities, with NOVA2 predominantly expressed in cortical regions and NOVA1 in the cerebellum and spinal cord. De novo truncating variants in NOVA2 are responsible for a severe neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD), characterized by intellectual developmental disorder, motor delay, autistic features, and corpus callosum hypoplasia. Loss of Nova2 in animal models results in brain development anomalies, such as corpus callosum agenesis in mice, which mirrors the human neurodevelopmental phenotype. If direct evidence remains limited, emerging data suggest that mutations in NOVA1 might also be involved in neurological disorders. The contribution of other mRNA-binding proteins to NDD further underscores the critical role of regulation of RNA processing in neurodevelopment.

40555085,Multiorgan involvement and genetic spectrum of 20 Chinese patients with PMM2-CDG.,"The most common congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) is the phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2) deficiency (PMM2-CDG). PMM2-CDG is a complex genetic disorder that often found in infancy or early childhood with a clinically heterogeneous variety of neurological and non- neurological symptoms. To expand the phenotypic and genetic spectrum of PMM2-CDG, we summarized the characteristics of 20 Chinese patients. All patients were diagnosed by genetic analysis. Clinical characteristics, genotypes, imaging, electrophysiological, and metabolic data were analyzed retrospectively. Twelve males and eight females with PMM2-CDG were included. The median age at diagnosis was 12.0 (ranging from 6.0 to 52.0) months, while the median age at final follow-up was 10.3 (ranging from 5.1 to 12.8) years. All patients exhibited multisystem symptoms and various neurological symptoms were observed. Developmental delay was the primary initial symptoms. Dystaxia, growth retardation and liver damage were also common phenotypes. Cerebellar atrophy was the characteristic abnormality on brain imaging. Fourteen variants of the PMM2 gene were identified, of which five, c.82A > G (p.M28V), c.551C > T (p. P184L), c.640G > T (p.G214C), c.656A > T (p.E219V) and c.712C > G (p.R238G), were newly reported. The most prevalent variant was c.430 T > C (p.F144L), which was identified in 65.0 % of patients, followed by c.395 T > C (p.I132T). Consistent with reports from other populations, missense variants constituted the predominant type of PMM2 gene alterations. PMM2-CDG presents as a multi-system disease with diverse clinical phenotypes, posing challenges to early identification and diagnosis. The most common pathogenic variant in this Chinese cohort was c.430 T > C (p.F144L), which is close to, but different from, the common pathogenic variant c.422G > A (p.R141H) among European PMM2-CDG patients.",Molecular genetics and metabolism,2025.0,Huiting Zhang; Jingtao Zhang; Weimeng Ma; Xue Ma; Ruxuan He; Yuan Ding; Yupeng Liu; Wenyue Zhang; Hui Dong; Yao Zhang; Miao He; Yanling Yang,common congenital disorder glycosylation cdg phosphomannomutase 2 pmm2 deficiency pmm2 cdg pmm2 cdg complex genetic disorder find infancy early childhood clinically heterogeneous variety neurological non- neurological symptom expand phenotypic genetic spectrum pmm2 cdg summarize characteristic 20 chinese patient patient diagnose genetic analysis clinical characteristic genotype imaging electrophysiological metabolic datum analyze retrospectively male female pmm2 cdg include median age diagnosis 12.0 range 6.0 52.0 month median age final follow 10.3 range 5.1 12.8 year patient exhibit multisystem symptom neurological symptom observe developmental delay primary initial symptom dystaxia growth retardation liver damage common phenotype cerebellar atrophy characteristic abnormality brain imaging fourteen variant pmm2 gene identify c.82a > g p. m28v c.551c > t p. p184l c.640 g > t p. g214c c.656a > t p. e219v c.712c > g p. r238 g newly report prevalent variant c.430 t > c p. f144l identify 65.0 patient follow c.395 t > c p. i132 t consistent report population missense variant constitute predominant type pmm2 gene alteration pmm2 cdg present multi system disease diverse clinical phenotype pose challenge early identification diagnosis common pathogenic variant chinese cohort c.430 t > c p. f144l close different common pathogenic variant c.422 g > p. r141h european pmm2 cdg patient
40555083,Multivariate neural markers of individual differences in thought control difficulties.,"This study identified specific patterns of brain activity distributed within and across four different brain networks associated with an individual's difficulties in controlling thoughts, a transdiagnostic feature of mental health disorders. Previously, we demonstrated that four working memory control operations-maintaining, replacing, suppressing, and clearing thoughts-are represented by distinct multi-voxel patterns of brain activation. Moreover, the exact pattern that characterizes these operations is distinct across four sets of brain regions, referred to as working memory operation networks, that include a Visual Network (VN), Somatomotor Network (SMN), Default Mode Network (DMN), and Frontoparietal Control Network (FPCN). The current study examined the hypothesis that aspects of these multi-voxel patterns are associated with an individual's difficulty in controlling thoughts, as derived from a composite of three self-report questionnaires, in a non-clinical (N = 48) sample. Consistent with our hypothesis, three effects were observed. Individuals with higher levels of thought-control difficulty have less distinct multi-voxel patterns for each of the four operations, have a less distinct representation of the suppression and clear operations in the DMN network from its representations in other networks, and have a more variable representation of multiple operations within each of the FPCN, VN and SMN networks. These neural patterns accounted for over 30 % of the variance in self-reported thought difficulties. Moreover, these associations were specific to working memory operations as they were not observed at rest, highlighting their relevance for understanding the neural mechanisms of repetitive negative thinking and their potential as biomarkers for interventions targeting impaired thought control.",NeuroImage.

We investigated possible differences in the acquisition and extinction of conditioned responses using unconditioned stimuli (UCS) which elicit fear, disgust, or both emotions simultaneously. Participants underwent a sequential conditioning paradigm over three consecutive days (acquisition, extinction, and extinction retrieval) and were randomly assigned to fear (F), disgust (D), or mixed (FD) conditioning. Pictorial stimuli (UCS) and neutral faces (as conditioned stimuli; CS) were used, with CS-UCS contingency, valence, fear, and disgust ratings as readout measures. The D and FD groups showed higher valence and disgust ratings after acquisition than the F group, with no group differences in CS-UCS contingency or fear ratings. During extinction, the F group had the greatest reduction in CS-UCS contingency ratings, and the D group showed the largest decrease in disgust ratings for CS+. At extinction retrieval, disgust ratings decreased most in the D group, while fear ratings dropped most in the F and FD groups for CS-. No significant group differences were found for valence during extinction and extinction retrieval. Conditioning with UCS evoking disgust or disgust and fear simultaneously led to stronger negative valence and disgust responses compared to conditioning with fear-evoking stimuli. Extinction was most effective in the F group (highest reduction of CS-UCS contingency ratings), offering some support for the idea that disgust may be more resistant to extinction than fear.",Behaviour research and therapy,2025.0,Annalisa Lipp; Armin Zlomuzica,understand difference conditioning stimulus evoke fear and/or disgust valuable develop meaningful intervention phobia anxiety disorder obsessive compulsive disorder ocd investigate possible difference acquisition extinction condition response unconditioned stimulus ucs elicit fear disgust emotion simultaneously participant undergo sequential conditioning paradigm consecutive day acquisition extinction extinction retrieval randomly assign fear f disgust d mixed fd conditioning pictorial stimulus ucs neutral face condition stimulus cs cs ucs contingency valence fear disgust rating readout measure d fd group show high valence disgust rating acquisition f group group difference cs ucs contingency fear rating extinction f group great reduction cs ucs contingency rating d group show large decrease disgust rating cs+ extinction retrieval disgust rating decrease d group fear rating drop f fd group cs- significant group difference find valence extinction extinction retrieval conditioning ucs evoke disgust disgust fear simultaneously lead strong negative valence disgust response compare conditioning fear evoke stimulus extinction effective f group high reduction cs ucs contingency rating offer support idea disgust resistant extinction fear
40555075,An anxiety screening framework integrating multimodal data and graph node correlation.,"Anxiety disorders are a significant global health concern, profoundly impacting patients' lives and social functioning while imposing considerable burdens on families and economies. However, current anxiety screening methods face limitations due to cost constraints and cognitive biases, particularly in their inability to deeply model correlations among multidimensional features. They often overlook crucial information inherent in their internal couplings, limiting their accuracy and applicability in clinical diagnostics. To address these challenges, we propose an advanced anxiety screening framework that integrates multimodal data, such as physiological, behavioral, audio, and textual, using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). While our framework draws upon existing technologies such as GCN, one-dimensional convolutional neural networks, and gated recurrent units, the uniqueness of our framework lies in how these components are combined to capture complex spatiotemporal relationships and correlations among multimodal features. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's robust performance, achieving an accuracy of 93.48%, Area Under Curve of 94.58%, precision of 90.00%, sensitivity of 81.82%, specificity of 97.14%, F1 score of 85.71%. Notably, the method remains effective even when questionnaire data is unavailable, underscoring its practicality and reliability.

40555059,Clinical insights into the mechanisms of infectious microbes and microbiota in chronic neurologic and psychiatric diseases.,"Chronic neurologic and psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia, depression, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's are increasingly linked to infectious microorganisms and gut microbiota. This review explores how pathogenic microorganisms and microbial communities impact neuropsychiatric, neurodegenerative, and neuroinflammatory processes, highlighting the gut-brain axis' crucial communication network in influencing behavior and brain function. Infectious agents like bacteria, viruses, and fungi cause disease by causing neurotoxic reactions, disrupting the blood-brain barrier, and activating neuroinflammatory cascades. Gut dysbiosis impacts immunological homeostasis and neural transmission by altering the synthesis of metabolites from microorganisms, such as short-chain fatty acids and neurotransmitter precursors. Neurodegeneration and psychiatric diseases are influenced by molecular mechanisms such as toll-like receptor signaling, microglial activation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. This review highlights the potential of microbiota-targeted treatments such as probiotics, prebiotics, and microbiome transplantation as novel treatments for chronic diseases. Understanding the intricate interactions between infectious microorganisms, microbiota, and the central nervous system enables the formation of precision medicine strategies to challenge the rising incidence of neurologic and psychiatric diseases. Future research should explore causal relationships and identify specific microbial biomarkers to enhance early diagnosis, prevention, and personalized treatment plans.","Pathology, research and practice",2025.0,Md Faysal; Mehrukh Zehravi; Md Al Amin; Safia Obaidur Rab; Patibandla Jahnavi; Uppuluri Varuna Naga Venkata Arjun; Jeetendra Kumar Gupta; Abdul Ajeed Mohathasim Billah; Rajeshwar Vodeti; P Dharani Prasad; Sultan Saeed Sultan Aseri; Falak A Siddiqui; Talha Bin Emran,chronic neurologic psychiatric disease schizophrenia depression parkinson alzheimer increasingly link infectious microorganism gut microbiota review explore pathogenic microorganism microbial community impact neuropsychiatric neurodegenerative neuroinflammatory process highlight gut brain axis crucial communication network influence behavior brain function infectious agent like bacteria virus fungi cause disease cause neurotoxic reaction disrupt blood brain barrier activate neuroinflammatory cascade gut dysbiosis impact immunological homeostasis neural transmission alter synthesis metabolite microorganism short chain fatty acid neurotransmitter precursor neurodegeneration psychiatric disease influence molecular mechanism toll like receptor signal microglial activation mitochondrial dysfunction review highlight potential microbiota target treatment probiotic prebiotic microbiome transplantation novel treatment chronic disease understand intricate interaction infectious microorganism microbiota central nervous system enable formation precision medicine strategy challenge rise incidence neurologic psychiatric disease future research explore causal relationship identify specific microbial biomarker enhance early diagnosis prevention personalize treatment plan
40554975,LG-TriCapsNet: A lightweight graph capsule framework with nearest neighbor graphs for multi-disease EEG classification.,"EEG signal classification for neurological disorders is a very critical task in the healthcare field, demanding accuracy and efficiency. Due to the diversity of these disorders and the complexity of the EEG signals, the task of diagnosing these disorders is very challenging. Traditional methods usually cannot capture the intricate relationships between temporal and spatial features, which are inherent in EEG data. To overcome this challenge, the proposed Lightweight Graph Triplet Capsule Networks combined with Nearest Neighbor Graphs effectively leverage both temporal and spatial information in EEG signals. The graph-based representation enhances the spread of information across the network, which thus performs efficient feature extraction and good classification performance. By integrating NNG, the model dynamically captures spatial-temporal dependencies between EEG channels, significantly improving feature discrimination across neurological conditions. The novelty of the approach lies in the combination of graph structures and capsule networks, which particularly makes it suited for handling the complexities of EEG data. LG-TriCapsNet is performing quite well as the F1 score is 98.32 %, accuracy is 98.34 %, sensitivity is 98.30 %, and specificity is 98.40 %, and it also outperforms the current state-of-the-art models, which points to the fact that this framework is really effective for the classification of such a variety of neurological disorders. LG-TriCapsNet, by providing a computationally efficient, real-time solution, holds great potential for advancing clinical decision-making and patient care by offering a robust tool for automated neurological disease detection and diagnosis.

40554955,Functional food lycopene mitigates obesity-related cognitive decline via lipid metabolism regulation and neuroprotection via taurine and glutathione pathway.,"Obesity has emerged as a critical global public health challenge, contributing not only to metabolic disorders but also to neurological complications, including cognitive decline. Lycopene, a carotenoid found abundantly in tomatoes, has gained attention as a functional food due to its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study explores the neuroprotective effects of lycopene against obesity-related cognitive impairment in male C57BL/6 mice. Mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for four months to induce obesity, followed by supplementation with lycopene (50 mg/kg). Cognitive performance was assessed through Y-maze, Morris water maze, and novel object recognition tests. We also examined systemic and hippocampal inflammatory markers, along with lipidomic and proteomic profiles. Lycopene supplementation significantly improved cognitive function, restored neuronal density, and enhanced levels of key neuroprotective proteins, including BDNF and NeuN. Lipidomic analysis revealed a reduction in pro-inflammatory lipids (e.g., lysophosphatidylcholine, triglycerides) and an increase in neuroprotective lipids (e.g., phosphatidylserine, fatty acids). Additionally, proteomic data showed a decrease in lipid-induced neurotoxic proteins and an upregulation of pathways associated with taurine and glutathione metabolism, promoting neuronal stability and plasticity. These results suggest that lycopene exerts neuroprotective effects by restoring lipid balance and modulating amino acid signaling pathways, thereby alleviating cognitive decline in obese mice. This study highlights lycopene's potential as a functional dietary ingredient to combat obesity-related neurological disorders and provides novel insights into the development of food-based strategies to improve both metabolic health and cognitive function.","Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2025.0,Yuqing Wu; Jingfang Liu,obesity emerge critical global public health challenge contribute metabolic disorder neurological complication include cognitive decline lycopene carotenoid find abundantly tomato gain attention functional food potent antioxidant anti inflammatory property study explore neuroprotective effect lycopene obesity relate cognitive impairment male c57bl/6 mouse mouse feed high fat diet hfd month induce obesity follow supplementation lycopene 50 mg kg cognitive performance assess y maze morris water maze novel object recognition test examine systemic hippocampal inflammatory marker lipidomic proteomic profile lycopene supplementation significantly improve cognitive function restore neuronal density enhance level key neuroprotective protein include bdnf neun. lipidomic analysis reveal reduction pro inflammatory lipid e.g. lysophosphatidylcholine triglyceride increase neuroprotective lipid e.g. phosphatidylserine fatty acid additionally proteomic datum show decrease lipid induce neurotoxic protein upregulation pathway associate taurine glutathione metabolism promote neuronal stability plasticity result suggest lycopene exert neuroprotective effect restore lipid balance modulate amino acid signal pathway alleviate cognitive decline obese mouse study highlight lycopene potential functional dietary ingredient combat obesity relate neurological disorder provide novel insight development food base strategy improve metabolic health cognitive function
40554893,Xiaoer Huanglong pellets remodels the periphery microenvironment to improve attention deficit hyperactivity disorder based on the microbiota-gut-brain axis.,"Recently, research interest in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has grown significantly, driven by its increasing incidence and substantial societal impact. Among the various pathogenic mechanisms under investigation, the microbiota-gut-brain axis has emerged as a crucial area of focus. In the context of ADHD treatment, Xiaoer Huanglong Pellets (XRHLP), a traditional Chinese herbal formulation, have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy, although the underlying mechanisms remain partially understood. This study aimed to analyze and compare the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of XRHLP, including gastric release (WR_HL), enteric release (CR_HL), and colon release (JCR_HL) pellets, for ADHD treatment. This study employed a multi-modal approach to investigate the effects of XRHLP on ADHD. Behavioral assessments combined with Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western-blot analyses were conducted to evaluate the therapeutic outcomes in model rats with ADHD. Comprehensive profiling of the gut-brain axis was performed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and untargeted and targeted metabolomic analyses. The causal role of the gut microbiota was further validated using fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). WR_HL, CR_HL, and JCR_HL improved ADHD-like behaviors and neurotransmission dysfunction, with JCR_HL exhibiting superior intervention effects compared to WR_HL and CR_HL. These therapeutic effects are mediated through multiple pathways, including the restoration of gut microbial homeostasis, attenuation of inflammatory cascades, and repair of compromised intestinal and blood-brain barrier. The intervention also corrected systemic metabolic imbalances by specifically addressing the abnormalities in amino acid metabolism, neurotransmitter regulation, and short-chain fatty acid production. FMT experiments further confirmed the critical role of microbial modulation in mediating the behavioral and microbial regulatory effects of XRHLP. In summary, XRHLP exerts anti-ADHD effects by improving the microbiota-gut-brain axis and correcting amino acid metabolic disorders, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which traditional Chinese medicine influences ADHD and offers potential avenues for drug development.",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2025.0,Longtai You; Hulinyue Peng; Jing Liu; Na Sai; Wenwen Zhao; Xiao Li; Chunjing Yang; Peng Guo; Jian Ni,recently research interest attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd grow significantly drive increase incidence substantial societal impact pathogenic mechanism investigation microbiota gut brain axis emerge crucial area focus context adhd treatment xiaoer huanglong pellets xrhlp traditional chinese herbal formulation demonstrate therapeutic efficacy underlie mechanism remain partially understand study aim analyze compare therapeutic effect underlie mechanism xrhlp include gastric release wr_hl enteric release cr_hl colon release jcr_hl pellet adhd treatment study employ multi modal approach investigate effect xrhlp adhd behavioral assessment combine enzyme link immunosorbent assay western blot analysis conduct evaluate therapeutic outcome model rat adhd comprehensive profiling gut brain axis perform 16s ribosomal rna sequence untargeted target metabolomic analysis causal role gut microbiota validate fecal microbiota transplantation fmt wr_hl cr_hl jcr_hl improve adhd like behavior neurotransmission dysfunction jcr_hl exhibit superior intervention effect compare wr_hl cr_hl therapeutic effect mediate multiple pathway include restoration gut microbial homeostasis attenuation inflammatory cascade repair compromise intestinal blood brain barrier intervention correct systemic metabolic imbalance specifically address abnormality amino acid metabolism neurotransmitter regulation short chain fatty acid production fmt experiment confirm critical role microbial modulation mediate behavioral microbial regulatory effect xrhlp summary xrhlp exerts anti adhd effect improve microbiota gut brain axis correct amino acid metabolic disorder provide new insight molecular mechanism traditional chinese medicine influence adhd offer potential avenue drug development
40554870,Exploring applications of electrically evoked compound action potentials using the vestibulo-cochlear implant.,"Vestibulo-cochlear implants are a potential treatment approach for patients with loss of vestibular function. A critical aspect is the development of reliable and objective outcome measures, to assess their efficacy and optimize their performance. As in cochlear implant care and other neural prostheses, electrically evoked compound action potentials (eCAP) can be used to measure the neural response to implant stimulation. eCAPs might provide information about the presence and misalignment of the electrically evoked vestibulo-ocular reflex, and potential vestibulo-cochlear interactions. This could be valuable in intra-operative functionality assessment, as input for fitting, and to measure spread of excitation. This study aimed to explore the potential role of eCAPs in vestibulo-cochlear implant research. eCAPs were measured in ten subjects with a vestibulo-cochlear implant. Different configurations were used, i.e., trans-canal, vestibulo-cochlear and cochleo-vestibular. The predictive value of eCAPs was evaluated for four outcomes: presence of an electrically evoked vestibulo-ocular reflex (eVOR), degree of misalignment of the eVOR, auditory perception due to vestibular stimulation, and the prevalence of vestibular activation due to cochlear stimulation. The results demonstrated a high positive predictive value of the eCAP for the presence of an eVOR (i.e., 1.0), while the negative predictive value was low (i.e., 0.54). The presence of trans-canal eCAP did not correspond with the degree of misalignment in the eVOR. Furthermore, the predictive values for auditory perception were low (i.e., ≤0.5). eCAP recordings in the cochlea to vestibular configuration imply a high likelihood of cochlear to vestibular interaction (i.e., 67% of electrodes). The presence of a vestibular eCAP was demonstrated to be a predictor of the presence of the eVOR. However, the low negative predictive value prevents the eCAP from providing a reliable indicator for intra-operative electrode position evaluation. eCAP measurements in vestibulo-cochlear configurations indicated that spread of excitation between the cochlea and canals is already possible at stimulation levels within the clinical fitting range of both the vestibular and cochlear electrodes. Measured eCAPs did not correspond with misalignment of the eVOR or the presence of an auditory percept as result of vestibular stimulation. Future research is needed to elucidate the full potential of vestibulo-cochlear implant eCAP measurements.",Hearing research,2025.0,Stan C J van Boxel; Bernd L Vermorken; Benjamin Volpe; Nils Guinand; Angélica Perez-Fornos; Elke M J Devocht; Raymond van de Berg,vestibulo cochlear implant potential treatment approach patient loss vestibular function critical aspect development reliable objective outcome measure assess efficacy optimize performance cochlear implant care neural prosthesis electrically evoke compound action potential ecap measure neural response implant stimulation ecaps provide information presence misalignment electrically evoke vestibulo ocular reflex potential vestibulo cochlear interaction valuable intra operative functionality assessment input fitting measure spread excitation study aim explore potential role ecaps vestibulo cochlear implant research ecaps measure subject vestibulo cochlear implant different configuration i.e. tran canal vestibulo cochlear cochleo vestibular predictive value ecaps evaluate outcome presence electrically evoke vestibulo ocular reflex evor degree misalignment evor auditory perception vestibular stimulation prevalence vestibular activation cochlear stimulation result demonstrate high positive predictive value ecap presence evor i.e. 1.0 negative predictive value low i.e. 0.54 presence trans canal ecap correspond degree misalignment evor furthermore predictive value auditory perception low i.e. ≤0.5 ecap recording cochlea vestibular configuration imply high likelihood cochlear vestibular interaction i.e. 67 electrode presence vestibular ecap demonstrate predictor presence evor low negative predictive value prevent ecap provide reliable indicator intra operative electrode position evaluation ecap measurement vestibulo cochlear configuration indicate spread excitation cochlea canal possible stimulation level clinical fitting range vestibular cochlear electrode measure ecaps correspond misalignment evor presence auditory percept result vestibular stimulation future research need elucidate potential vestibulo cochlear implant ecap measurement
40554822,A repertoire and critical review of international resources relevant to medical assistance in dying where a mental disorder is the sole underlying medical condition.,"The possibility of asking for help in ending one's life is at the heart of some of the most enduring debates in medicine and bioethics. As a growing number of countries open to the practice, many concerns are emerging internationally about medical assistance in dying where a mental disorder is the sole underlying medical condition (MAiD-MD). It is paramount to understand what academic literature and resources are available to support different stakeholders in the context of MAiD-MD. This review aims to specifically identify various resources related to MAiD-MD and to initiate a process of compiling international resources to raise awareness about certain resources and support stakeholders to develop new resources. This review of resources adopted a methodology inspired by the work of Arksey and O'Malley (2005) and Levac et al. (2010)'s scoping studies, as well as more structured forms of thematic literature reviews for content extraction. 165 resources related directly or indirectly to MAiD-MD were identified and grouped according to the following six categories: 1) Laws, judgments, decisions, and reports from the operationalization of laws; 2) Ethical and clinical guidelines, protocols, practice guides, and information for healthcare professionals; 3) Resource directories; 4) Resources for sharing experiences, discussions, support or training; 5) Written resources for MAiD applicants, their relatives or the population; 6) Resources to support reflections and guide the development of practices. Twenty main relevant themes were identified through the thematic analysis. These themes are addressed and explored in varying degrees of depth throughout different resources. A diversity of relevant resources is developed internationally, but these are sometimes dispersed, little known, or inaccessible to the public. Numerous resources are developed to inform the various stakeholders and train healthcare professionals, but there seems to be a need to develop advanced support resources to help the various stakeholders in the context of MAiD-MD.",International journal of law and psychiatry,2025.0,Caroline Favron-Godbout; Izadora Foster; Eric Racine,possibility ask help end life heart enduring debate medicine bioethic grow number country open practice concern emerge internationally medical assistance die mental disorder sole underlie medical condition maid md paramount understand academic literature resource available support different stakeholder context maid md review aim specifically identify resource relate maid md initiate process compile international resource raise awareness certain resource support stakeholder develop new resource review resource adopt methodology inspire work arksey o'malley 2005 levac et al 2010 scope study structured form thematic literature review content extraction 165 resource relate directly indirectly maid md identify group accord follow category 1 law judgment decision report operationalization law 2 ethical clinical guideline protocol practice guide information healthcare professional 3 resource directory 4 resource share experience discussion support training 5 write resource maid applicant relative population 6 resource support reflection guide development practice main relevant theme identify thematic analysis theme address explore vary degree depth different resource diversity relevant resource develop internationally disperse little know inaccessible public numerous resource develop inform stakeholder train healthcare professional need develop advanced support resource help stakeholder context maid md
40554800,Pursuit of Digital Innovation in Psychiatric Data Handling Practices in Ireland: Comprehensive Case Study.,"Ireland is ranked among the most disadvantageous European countries in terms of mental health challenges. Contrary to general health services that primarily focus on diagnosis and treatment, the mental health sector in Ireland deals with highly sensitive psychiatric case notes based on patient-doctor conversations. Such data, therefore, must be collected, analyzed, and stored with an approach customized specifically for psychiatry. This study's objective involves examining the state of data handling practices in the Irish Mental Health Services (MHS), identifying the shortcomings regarding privacy, security, and usability of psychiatric case notes, and proposing an innovative technological solution that addresses most of the surfaced challenges. The study was conducted using a comprehensive methodology. Our approach involved a thorough literature review, ethics approval, web-based surveys with mental health professionals as participants, interviews of psychiatrists, interactions with mental health organizations, analysis of inspection reports by the Ireland Mental Health Commission, and comparative evaluation of existing IT solutions. The thoroughness of our adopted research methodology instills confidence in the reliability and validity of our findings. Our study revealed outdated data management, heavy reliance on paperwork resulting in serious repercussions, parallel workload, alarmingly low readability of notes, and a nonviable setup that hinders research and analytical examination. Our survey reported an average score of 4.37 of 10 (SD 1.25) given by participants in terms of technology use. Regarding privacy measures, 75% (n=12) of participants mentioned that staff members are allowed to keep their phones while accessing psychiatric case notes. Similarly, 80% (n=13) of submissions highlighted that multiple staff members can access sensitive notes and patients' contact information. On the other hand, Mental Health Commission reports showed that their inspections are limited to evaluating physical privacy only. Regarding technological comparative analysis, we observed that conventional IT solutions are vulnerable against cyberattacks and fall short in addressing multiple challenges simultaneously. Therefore, an innovative convergence of different technologies is needed. Our research supports speech-to-text transcription for data collection, interactive artificial intelligence for data analysis, and permissioned blockchain for data storage and retrieval. Our survey participants also estimated the proposed solution to optimize their workload by an average of 35%. Irish MHS seem to be handling psychiatric data under polycrisis circumstances; therefore, a single-dimensional digitization of records would not be sufficient in addressing the wide range of concerns. In addition to highlighting intertwined challenges in Irish psychiatry and validating the need for innovation in data handling practices in Irish MHS, this study culminated in the proposal of an innovative technological solution that offers a significant contribution to a considerably improved, efficient, and compliant service delivery in mental health care.",JMIR human factors,2025.0,Rana Zeeshan; John Bogue; Amna Gill; Mamoona Naveed Asghar,ireland rank disadvantageous european country term mental health challenge contrary general health service primarily focus diagnosis treatment mental health sector ireland deal highly sensitive psychiatric case note base patient doctor conversation datum collect analyze store approach customize specifically psychiatry study objective involve examine state datum handle practice irish mental health services mhs identify shortcoming privacy security usability psychiatric case note propose innovative technological solution address surface challenge study conduct comprehensive methodology approach involve thorough literature review ethic approval web base survey mental health professional participant interview psychiatrist interaction mental health organization analysis inspection report ireland mental health commission comparative evaluation exist solution thoroughness adopt research methodology instill confidence reliability validity finding study reveal outdated datum management heavy reliance paperwork result repercussion parallel workload alarmingly low readability note nonviable setup hinder research analytical examination survey report average score 4.37 10 sd 1.25 give participant term technology use privacy measure 75 n=12 participant mention staff member allow phone access psychiatric case note similarly 80 n=13 submission highlight multiple staff member access sensitive note patient contact information hand mental health commission report show inspection limit evaluate physical privacy technological comparative analysis observe conventional solution vulnerable cyberattack fall short address multiple challenge simultaneously innovative convergence different technology need research support speech text transcription data collection interactive artificial intelligence datum analysis permissione blockchain datum storage retrieval survey participant estimate propose solution optimize workload average 35 irish mhs handle psychiatric datum polycrisis circumstance single dimensional digitization record sufficient address wide range concern addition highlight intertwine challenge irish psychiatry validate need innovation datum handle practice irish mhs study culminate proposal innovative technological solution offer significant contribution considerably improve efficient compliant service delivery mental health care
40554785,Factors Related to Depressive Symptoms in People with Gambling Disorder.,"Gambling disorders may be associated with mental health issues, such as depressive disorders, as well as poor overall health and specific medical conditions. This study was a case-control study that compared a group with depressive symptoms (<i>n</i> = 33) to a group without depressive symptoms (<i>n</i> = 33), aiming to explore the relationship between factors associated with depressive symptoms. The group with depressive symptoms had shorter weekly exercise time and higher problem gambling severity and physical symptom scores than the group without depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms were associated with increased levels of problem gambling severity and physical symptoms. In the group with depressive symptoms, a decrease in the severity of problem gambling was associated with an increase in problem drinking. Although serotonin levels did not differ between the two groups based on depressive symptoms, serotonin levels were correlated with changes in appetite in the depressive symptom group. The lower the serotonin levels in the group with depressive symptoms, the greater the tendency to borrow money or sell personal belongings to fund gambling activities.

40554780,Video- Versus Text-Based Psychoeducation in Web-Based E-Mental Health Programs: Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Mental health disorders affect 1 in 8 people worldwide, yet many face barriers to accessing care. E-mental health interventions, including self-guided internet-based programs, offer promising solutions. However, the mechanisms driving knowledge gain in such programs remain poorly understood. The role of medium, topic, sequence, and confidence and their interaction in learning outcomes need further investigation. Additionally, the influence of knowledge gaps on the outcome of psychoeducational intervention is not well understood (eg, whether psychoeducation requires an existing knowledge gap to be effective). This randomized controlled trial investigated the role of medium, topic, sequence, and participants' initial knowledge levels on knowledge gain and confidence in fully automated self-guided e-mental health psychoeducation. A total of 158 adults (mean age 34, SD 12.4 years; n=118, 74.7% female) were randomized to 8 experimental conditions (receiving video, texts, or both containing psychoeducational content on sleep or social competence; n=142) or a control group (neutral video; n=16). The fully automated interventions (videos) were developed for use in web-based e-mental health interventions. They address transdiagnostic symptoms and hence are relevant across various disorders. To assess the added value of video production for knowledge gain, text-based scripts corresponding to the video content were created and compared. All interventions and outcome assessments were delivered on the web via Qualtrics without face-to-face components. Pre- and postintervention knowledge was assessed using a validated 30-item knowledge test (true/false). Confidence in responses was rated on a 0% to 100% scale. Statistical analyses included 3-way ANOVA and multivariate ANOVA. Knowledge significantly increased across experimental groups (F<sub>1,156</sub>=17.272; P<.001; η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.10). Participants with social competence deficits had significantly lower baseline knowledge (P=.04; d=0.41). For sleep deficits, a nonsignificant trend emerged (P=.09; d=0.28). Participants with social competence deficits demonstrated greater knowledge improvement (t<sub>141</sub>=7.12; P<.001; d=0.60). Participants with sleep deficits showed smaller but significant gains (t<sub>141</sub>=2.43; P=.02; d=0.20). No significant differences in knowledge gain were found between video and text formats. Confidence in correct answers increased significantly in the experimental group (mean 42.82, 95% CI 41.15-44.50 to mean 51.67, 95% CI 49.28-54.04), with larger gains for social competence than sleep. Confidence in the control group remained unchanged. Both video and text formats effectively facilitated knowledge gain in e-mental health interventions, with no clear advantage of one medium over the other. Participants with prior deficits learned more in areas where they initially lacked knowledge. Confidence in correct answers increased alongside knowledge, highlighting psychoeducation's role in promoting self-efficacy.

Inclusion criteria included studies that related ADHD and Pyromania/Firesetters, while exclusion criteria included articles not related to the researched variables, articles from other systematic reviews, and articles not related to childhood and/or adolescence. Of the 71 articles initially identified, five met the eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis, which demonstrated that ADHD and Pyromania/Firesetters are comorbid conditions that can be diagnosed during childhood and/or adolescence. The comorbid relationship was observed to be more prevalent in boys, with an estimated prevalence of approximately 33%. Firesetting behavior was associated with a sixfold increase in the likelihood of boys being diagnosed with ADHD. Moreover, the comorbid relationship between ADHD and Pyromania/Firesetters was linked to conduct disorders and an elevated risk of future delinquent behavior. Mental health professionals should consider investigating firesetting history during the diagnostic assessment of ADHD, as the absence of early diagnosis and treatment increases the risk of adverse social outcomes. The study concluded that the results demonstrated the comorbid relationship between ADHD and Pyromania/Firesetters in childhood and adolescence, but more research is needed to better understand this relationship.",Trends in psychiatry and psychotherapy,2025.0,Rodolfo Teles de Melo; Laiana Quagliato,following article aim explore relationship pyromania firesetters attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd childhood adolescence systematic literature review carry search engine pubmed psycinfo cochrane sicelo find relevant article inclusion criterion include study relate adhd pyromania firesetters exclusion criterion include article relate research variable article systematic review article relate childhood and/or adolescence 71 article initially identify meet eligibility criterion include analysis demonstrate adhd pyromania firesetter comorbid condition diagnose childhood and/or adolescence comorbid relationship observe prevalent boy estimate prevalence approximately 33 firesette behavior associate sixfold increase likelihood boy diagnose adhd comorbid relationship adhd pyromania firesetters link conduct disorder elevated risk future delinquent behavior mental health professional consider investigate firesette history diagnostic assessment adhd absence early diagnosis treatment increase risk adverse social outcome study conclude result demonstrate comorbid relationship adhd pyromania firesetters childhood adolescence research need well understand relationship
40554626,Characterization of the Pank2-/- mouse retinal phenotype as a pre-clinical model for pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration.,"Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) is an autosomal recessive movement and vision disorder in the neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation family of diseases. PKAN is caused by mutations in PANK2, encoding pantothenate kinase 2, causing an inborn error of coenzyme A metabolism and leading to iron accumulation in the basal ganglia. Peripheral pigmentary retinopathy is common in people with PKAN. The knockout murine model of the orthologous Pank2 gene is known to manifest retinal degeneration through electroretinography, pupillary response and histology analyses. Our longitudinal characterization of the retinopathy in this model reveals reduced visual performance and reduced photoreceptor thickness compared to wild-type mice. Additionally, retinal perturbations in coenzyme A metabolism and dopamine metabolism pathways mimic those previously observed in the brain. These data extend the murine ocular phenotype associated with loss of function of Pank2. With a measurable behavioral, structural and mechanistic retinal phenotype, this mouse model is an ideal pre-clinical model that can be used to evaluate therapeutics for PKAN.",PloS one,2025.0,Grace Li-Na Su; Suh Young Jeong; Dahlia Wafai; Wayne Tschetter; Dolly Zhen; Susan J Hayflick; Renee C Ryals,pantothenate kinase associate neurodegeneration pkan autosomal recessive movement vision disorder neurodegeneration brain iron accumulation family disease pkan cause mutation pank2 encode pantothenate kinase 2 cause inborn error coenzyme metabolism lead iron accumulation basal ganglia peripheral pigmentary retinopathy common people pkan knockout murine model orthologous pank2 gene know manifest retinal degeneration electroretinography pupillary response histology analysis longitudinal characterization retinopathy model reveal reduce visual performance reduced photoreceptor thickness compare wild type mouse additionally retinal perturbation coenzyme metabolism dopamine metabolism pathway mimic previously observe brain datum extend murine ocular phenotype associate loss function pank2 measurable behavioral structural mechanistic retinal phenotype mouse model ideal pre clinical model evaluate therapeutic pkan

This study aimed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the global burden and temporal trends of childhood meningitis from 1990 to 2021. We extracted data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2021 to estimate incident cases, incidence rates, deaths, and mortality rates of childhood meningitis at global, regional, and national levels. We further assessed the etiological composition of childhood meningitis across different age groups and sociodemographic index (SDI) regions. Additionally, cross-country inequality analyses were conducted to measure the distributional inequality of childhood meningitis burden across countries. In 2021, childhood meningitis accounted for approximately 1.33 million incident cases and 112,000 deaths worldwide. The global incidence rate of childhood meningitis decreased by 59.8%, from 164.80 per 100,000 in 1990 to 66.24 per 100,000 in 2021. The global mortality rate also decreased by 69.18%, from 18.12 per 100,000 in 1990 to 5.59 per 100,000 in 2021. In 2021, the top three etiologies responsible for global childhood meningitis deaths were Streptococcus pneumoniae (17.01%), Neisseria meningitidis (14.03%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.11%). Notably, the leading etiologies of neonatal meningitis deaths were Group B Streptococcus (22.70%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.97%), and viral etiologies (15.35%). Cross-country inequality analysis revealed that low SDI regions bore a disproportionate burden.

40554578,Prevalence of vision impairment among patients with diabetes mellitus in sub-Saharan Africa: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Diabetes mellitus is a growing global public health challenge, especially in low- and middle-income regions like sub-Saharan Africa, where healthcare resources are often limited. One of its most debilitating complications is vision impairment, which significantly impacts the quality of life, productivity, and independence of individuals. Although several studies have assessed the prevalence of vision impairment among individuals with diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa, their findings have been inconsistent and fragmented across different areas. A comprehensive synthesis of this evidence is crucial for informing healthcare planning, early screening, and management strategies. This study aimed to systematically review and synthesize the existing evidence on the prevalence of vision impairment among patients with diabetes mellitus in the region. A literature exploration was done in an electronic database such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Hinary, and African Journals Online. We included all observational studies reporting the prevalence of vision loss among diabetes mellitus patients in Sub-Saharan Africa. A random-effect meta-analysis model was computed to estimate the pooled prevalence of vision impairment. I2 test and Cochrane Q test statistics were used to assess the heterogeneity of the studies. Subgroup analysis was done based on the countries where the research was conducted. STATA Version 16 statistical software was used for data analysis. Publication bias was examined by funnel plots and Egger's tests. Only 26 studies with 12508 participants, contributing data from 14 countries within Sub-Saharan Africa, met the inclusion criteria for the final analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of visual impairment was found to be 29% (95% CI: 22%-35%). Heterogeneity was observed among included studies (p < 0.001 for high I2 values). Subgroup analysis revealed the source of heterogeneity in the studies carried out in Ethiopia (I2 = 99.2%, p = < 0.001), Nigeria (I2 = 94.59%, p = < 0.001), and Zambia (I2 = 77.34%, p = 0.036). The findings of this study indicated that the pooled prevalence of vision impairment among diabetes mellitus patients is relatively higher. It can be concluded that diabetes mellitus patients should be managed properly to prevent visual impairment.

40554536,"The Healthy Brain 9 (HB9): A new instrument to characterize subjective cognitive decline, and detect anosognosia in mild cognitive impairment.","Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) affects 10% of older adults and may be a risk factor for future mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Some individuals with MCI have anosognosia, the denial or lack of awareness of their cognitive deficits. We developed and tested the Healthy Brain 9 (HB9), a self-reported assessment of cognitive performance and everyday functioning, in a diverse community-based cohort of older adults in South Florida. Cross-sectional study. Community-based longitudinal study of brain health. A total of 344 participants (mean age of 68.5±9.3y, 70% were female, 62% with 16 or less years of education, 39% ethnoracial minorities) completed the study. The sample included 42% normal cognition, 27% SCD and 30% MCI. Within the MCI group, 62% demonstrated awareness of cognitive deficits and 38% had MCI with anosognosia. The psychometric properties of the HB9 were examined and the performance of the HB9 was compared to Gold Standard comprehensive clinical-cognitive-functional-behavioral evaluations and biomarkers evaluations from the Healthy Brain Initiative at the University of Miami. The HB9 had strong psychometric properties with a Cronbach α of 0.898 (95%CI: 0.882-0.913) and low floor and ceiling effects. The HB9 performed well across different sociodemographic groups. Lower HB9 scores were associated with greater resilience, better physical performance, and less physical frailty. Higher HB9 scores were associated with more comorbid medical conditions, more mood symptoms, lower resilience, and more functional impairment. A cut-off score of 4 on the HB9 provided a 15-fold ability to detect SCD in cognitively normal individuals, and a 14-fold ability to detect anosognosia in MCI.

Clinical pharmacists play a crucial role in optimising medication management and ensuring patient safety within the primary care setting. However, little is known about the specific barriers and challenges they face when delivering dementia care. This study investigates the safety of dementia care in the community, focusing on the experiences of clinical pharmacists. A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with clinical pharmacists. Data analysis employed codebook thematic analysis, guided by the SEIPS 2.0 framework. Thirteen clinical pharmacists were interviewed. Key risks include variations in pharmacist expertise, communication barriers, limited resources, and systemic challenges. Using the SEIPS 2.0 framework, the complex interactions between work systems (people, tools, tasks, organisation and environment) and work processes were identified, which impact safety outcomes for both clinical pharmacists and people with dementia.

40554512,A comprehensive mapping of stress system interactions with pain and their contribution to chronification of musculoskeletal pain: Protocol of the STRAIN study.,"Stress is suggested to be an important factor contributing to the development and persistence of musculoskeletal pain. Although stress and pain interactions are well known, it remains largely unclear how (dys)function of the major stress systems (i.e., the autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) contributes to pain extent and duration, and what the underlying mechanisms are. A comprehensive characterization of the stress systems and their interactions with pain is needed to better understand how stress confers vulnerability for persistent pain. The primary aim of this study is to characterize stress system (dys)functioning (i.e., including basal levels, reactivity and recovery to acute stress, and chronic stress levels) in musculoskeletal pain groups with varying pain duration and extent, and to investigate the interaction between stress and pain at the psychosocial, (psycho)physiological and neural level. The secondary aim is to define the contribution of stress to pain trajectories, including chronification and recovery. A study with a cross-sectional and a longitudinal arm will be conducted in musculoskeletal pain groups with varying pain characteristics, including chronic widespread pain (fibromyalgia), chronic and subacute localized pain (low back pain), and pain-free controls (n = 35/group). To characterize pain trajectories (recovery/persisting), localized pain groups will be reassessed after six months. Stress and pain characteristics and functionality will be assessed using questionnaires, autonomic measures (alpha-amylase, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, skin conductance and skin temperature), hormonal concentrations (cortisol and oxytocin), quantitative sensory testing (pain thresholds, pain tolerances, conditioned pain modulation and temporal summation of pain), and magnetic resonance imaging (brain structure and function). This study will provide crucial insights in the role of stress in the extent of pain symptomatology and in conferring risk for pain chronicity. Additionally, it will shed light on the underlying mechanisms of stress and pain interactions.

40554510,Association between serum zinc and serum neurofilament light chains: A population-based analysis.,"While serum zinc levels are strongly associated with various neurological disorders, the relationship between serum zinc and axonal damage remains largely unexplored. Consequently, the objective of this study was to investigate whether an association exists between serum zinc levels and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) concentrations in the general population. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted during 2013-2014 were utilized for this study. We applied multiple linear regression and smoothed curve fitting methods to explore the connection between serum zinc levels and sNfL. Furthermore, subgroup analyses and interaction tests were performed to assess the consistency of this association among various populations. This analysis included a total of 585 adults. After controlling for various confounding variables, we identified a significant negative association between serum zinc levels and sNfL (β = -0.62, 95% CI: -1.18, -0.05, p = 0.0321). Stratified analyses revealed that this negative association was significant only among individuals who were divorced, widowed, or separated, with no such association observed in other subgroups. This finding suggests that serum zinc levels may have a more pronounced impact on neurological health within these specific populations. Additionally, we identified an L-shaped association between serum zinc and sNfL, with an inflection point at 10.21 nmol/L.

40554484,Predicting podoplanin expression and prognostic significance in high-grade glioma based on TCGA TCIA radiomics.,"Podoplanin (PDPN) is a membrane glycoprotein implicated in tumor invasion and immune modulation in high-grade gliomas (HGGs). However, the non-invasive prediction of PDPN expression and its prognostic significance using radiomics remains unexplored. This study used preoperative contrast-enhanced MRI T1WI data analyzed by gradient boosting machine to predict podoplanin (PDPN) expression and overall survival (OS) in HGG patients. We retrospectively analyzed 89 HGG patients' clinical data, MRI images, and RNA-seq profiles from TCIA. For each patient, 107 radiomics features were extracted from HGG subregions. The radiomics prognostic model was built using two selected features, glcm_Idmn and glcn_Idn. Through validation with external the REMBRANDT dataset (n=39), the model demonstrated great predictive performance for the PDPN expression levels and OS in HGG. The area under the curve of the ROC in the radiomics signature combined with clinical risk factors for the 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year OS rates in the TCIA-HGG were 0.799, 0.883, and 0.923, respectively.

The sample were consisted of first year psychology students (N = 54; 22 males, 31 females, and 1 prefer not to say; age 18-54 years; median age = 23). Schizophrenia traits were measured using the schizotypal personality questionnaire (SPQ) and perceptual aberration scale (PAS). We found that higher SPQ scores correlated with a top field bias. Higher interpersonal scores (an SPQ subscore) linked to a right field, and so did PAS (p = .007). Higher cognitive-perceptual scores linked to a left field bias.

40554463,Characterizing Long COVID Symptoms During Early Childhood.,"Recent studies have identified characteristic symptom patterns of long COVID (LC) in adults and children older than 5 years. However, LC remains poorly characterized in early childhood. This knowledge gap limits efforts to identify, care for, and prevent LC in this vulnerable population. To identify symptoms that had the greatest difference in frequency comparing children with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection to those without, to identify differences in the types of symptoms by age group (infants/toddlers [0-2 years] vs preschool-aged children [3-5 years]), and to derive an index that can be used in research studies to identify young children with LC. This was a multisite longitudinal cohort study with enrollment from over 30 US health care and community settings, including infants, toddlers, and preschool-aged children with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection history. Study data were analyzed from May to December 2024. SARS-CoV-2 infection. LC and 41 symptoms among infants/toddlers and 75 symptoms among preschool-aged children. The study included 472 infants/toddlers (mean [SD] age, 12 [9] months; 278 infected with SARS-CoV-2; 194 uninfected; 234 male [50%]; 73 Black or African American [16%]; 198 Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish [43%]; 242 White [52%]) and 539 preschool-aged children (mean [SD] age, 48 [10] months; 399 infected with SARS-CoV-2; 140 uninfected; 277 female [51%]; 70 Black or African American [13%]; 210 Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish [39%]; 287 White [54%]). The median (IQR) time between first infections and completion of symptom surveys was 318 (198-494) days for infants/toddlers and 520 (330-844) days for preschool-aged children. A research index was derived for each age group based on symptoms most associated with infection history. The index is calculated by summing scores assigned to each prolonged symptom that was present, where higher scores indicate greater magnitude of association with history of SARS-CoV-2 infection: poor appetite (5 points), trouble sleeping (3.5 points), wet cough (3.5 points), dry cough (3 points), and stuffy nose (0.5 points) for infants/toddlers, and daytime tiredness/sleepiness/low energy (6.5 points) and dry cough (3 points) for preschool-aged children. Among infants/toddlers with infection, 40 of 278 (14%) were classified as having probable LC by having an index of at least 4 points. Among preschool-aged children, 61 of 399 (15%) were classified as having probable LC by having an index of at least 3 points.

40554452,Effect of the Preoperative Application of Esketamine on Stress Indicators in Paediatric Patients Undergoing Bronchoalveolar Lavage Under General Anaesthesia.,"<b>Aims/Background</b> To explore the effect of the preoperative administration of esketamine on stress indices in paediatric patients undergoing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) under general anaesthesia. <b>Methods</b> A retrospective cohort study was conducted to collect clinical data from children undergoing BAL under general anaesthesia in Tianjin Hospital of Tianjin University between February 2021 and January 2024. The patients were divided into two groups: the reference group (taking no preoperative medications) and the study group (receiving preoperative esketamine). The baseline variables of the two groups were balanced using the 1:1 nearest neighbour matching method of propensity score matching (PSM), and the outcome indicators of the matched cohorts were compared. <b>Results</b> A total of 168 patients were included, including 86 in the reference group and 82 in the study group. After PSM, 46 cases in each group were successfully matched. Results showed that all postoperative stress indicators in the study group were significantly lower than those in the reference group (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The Paediatric Anaesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scores and Face, Legs, Arms, Crying, Consolability (FLACC) scale scores of the children in the study group were significantly lower than those in the reference group (<i>p</i> < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the overall incidence of perioperative adverse reactions between the two groups (<i>p</i> > 0.05). <b>Conclusion</b> The preoperative application of esketamine can reduce the stress response in paediatric patients undergoing BAL under general anaesthesia.

40554450,"Improving Understanding, Recognition and Treatment for Men With Anorexia Nervosa.","<b>Aims/Background</b> Anorexia Nervosa (AN) in males is often overlooked due to the traditional perception of eating disorders as female concerns. Despite this, there has been an increased focus on male presentations. Research evidence, including concerns from people with lived experience, highlights specific risks and unmet clinical needs as a result of delayed help-seeking, inaccessible services, and treatment that does not account for men's needs. <b>Methods</b> Published research and personal narrative from an author with lived experience are combined to assess (1) existing evidence and gaps in knowledge and treatment for males with AN, and (2) solutions which may address challenges across research, policy, and clinical practice. <b>Results</b> There is an increased prevalence of AN amongst males, with most recent data from National Health Service (NHS) England showing a faster increase in hospitalisations amongst males compared with females. However, the quantity and quality of prevalence data and research into the drivers of this trend are severely lacking. The exclusion of males from clinical research has hindered efforts to assess the efficacy of current AN treatments, despite emerging evidence for males-specific symptoms and health impacts across biopsychosocial domains. These include more frequent use of excessive exercise, feelings of emasculation, neurodivergence, and specific physiological risks occurring at higher weights than females. These factors combine with under-resourced treatment provision which often feels exclusionary to males to create an increased risk of death and significant barriers to recovery. <b>Conclusion</b> Evidenced solutions for providing more timely recognition and effective treatment for males with AN are limited, emphasising the importance of further research. Present-day clinical practice needs to ensure the safe medical management of males with AN, taking an integrated approach to treatment that accounts for co-occurring conditions and minority status identities. Being more responsive to the needs of males with AN and removing the barriers to effective care can be aided by projects that collaborate with men with lived experience.","British journal of hospital medicine (London, England : 2005)",2025.0,James Downs; Clive Kelly,< b > aims background</b > anorexia nervosa male overlook traditional perception eat disorder female concern despite increase focus male presentation research evidence include concern people live experience highlight specific risk unmet clinical need result delayed help seeking inaccessible service treatment account man need < b > methods</b > publish research personal narrative author live experience combine assess 1 exist evidence gap knowledge treatment male 2 solution address challenge research policy clinical practice < b > results</b > increase prevalence male recent datum national health service nhs england show fast increase hospitalisation male compare female quantity quality prevalence datum research driver trend severely lacking exclusion male clinical research hinder effort assess efficacy current treatment despite emerge evidence male specific symptom health impact biopsychosocial domain include frequent use excessive exercise feeling emasculation neurodivergence specific physiological risk occur high weight female factor combine resource treatment provision feel exclusionary male create increase risk death significant barrier recovery < b > conclusion</b > evidence solution provide timely recognition effective treatment male limited emphasise importance research present day clinical practice need ensure safe medical management male take integrated approach treatment account co occurring condition minority status identity responsive need male remove barrier effective care aid project collaborate man live experience
40554441,"Combined Effects of Donepezil and Memantine on Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms, Cognitive Function, and Daily Living Abilities in Patients With Alzheimer's Disease.","<b>Aims/Background</b> Combined with memantine, donepezil has a beneficial impact on the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it can potentially increase the risk of adverse events. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of low-dose and high-dose donepezil combined with memantine on the behavioral and psychological symptoms, cognitive function, and daily living abilities of patients with moderate to severe AD, and to explore their safety. <b>Methods</b> This retrospective study includes 106 AD patients who received treatment in the Third People's Hospital of Fuyang from January 2022 to January 2024. The patients were grouped according to treatment regimen: patients receiving low-dose donepezil (5 mg/day) combined with memantine were included in the low-dose group (<i>n</i> = 45), and those receiving high-dose donepezil (10 mg/day) combined with memantine were included in the high-dose group (<i>n</i> = 61). The assessment results of behavioral and psychological symptoms, cognitive function, daily living ability, quality of life, sleep quality, as well as the occurrence of adverse reactions during treatment were obtained from electronic medical records for the two groups of patients before and after 24 weeks of treatment, and were compared using appropriate statistical tests. <b>Results</b> After 24 weeks of treatment, the scores of neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) and behavioral pathology in Alzheimer's disease rating scale (BEHAVE-AD) were similar between the two groups (<i>p</i> > 0.05). The scores of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive section (ADAS-Cog) were similar between the two groups (<i>p</i> > 0.05). The scores of activities of daily living (ADL) were comparable between the two groups (<i>p</i> > 0.05), and the low-dose group had significantly higher quality of life-Alzheimer's disease (QOL-AD) scores compared to the high-dose group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores of patients in the high-dose group were significantly higher than those before treatment and those in the low-dose group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in PSQI scores between the low-dose group before and after treatment (<i>p</i> > 0.05). During the treatment period, the total incidence of adverse reactions in the low-dose group was significantly lower than that in the high-dose group (11.11% vs. 27.87%, <i>p</i> < 0.05). <b>Conclusion</b> Both 5 mg/day or 10 mg/day donepezil in combination with memantine holds the potential to improve behavioral and psychological symptoms, cognitive function and daily living abilities in patients with moderate-to-severe AD.

40554439,Bidirectional Causal Relationship Between Myopia and Neurodegenerative Diseases: Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization Analyses.,"<b>Aims/Background</b> Myopia is highly prevalent in certain neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), and both conditions demonstrate genetic susceptibility. This study investigated the potential bidirectional causal relationships between myopia and four NDDs, Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), using Mendelian randomization (MR). We aimed to determine whether myopia contributes to the risk of NDDs and vice versa. <b>Methods</b> We analyzed data from two independent, large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) cohorts on myopia, comprising 212,571 participants in the first cohort (finn-b-H7_MYOPIA) and 95,619 in the second (GCST009521). GWAS summary statistics for the four NDDs, encompassing 589,439 samples, were also incorporated. Bidirectional MR was employed to investigate causal relationships between myopia and each of the four NDDs. The inverse variance-weighted (IVW) method served as the primary analytical approach. Sensitivity analyses, including MR-Egger regression, weighted median, weighted mode, and simple mode, were conducted to assess the robustness of the findings. Horizontal pleiotropy was evaluated using the MR-Egger regression intercept test and the Mendelian randomization pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) global test, while heterogeneity was assessed via Cochran's Q test. Leave-one-out analyses were conducted to evaluate the influence of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported, and statistical significance was set at <i>p</i> < 0.05. <b>Results</b> MR analyses identified no evidence of a causal relationship between myopia and refractive error and increased risk of any of the four NDDs (all <i>p</i> > 0.05). Similarly, none of the NDDs were associated with an increased risk of myopia or refractive error (all <i>p</i> > 0.05). Sensitivity analyses revealed no SNPs with significant influence on the causal associations (all <i>p</i> > 0.05), supporting the robustness of the findings. <b>Conclusion</b> This study provides no evidence of a bidirectional causal relationship between myopia and the four NDDs among individuals of European ancestry.

40554380,The GREENBEAN checklist for reporting studies evaluating the effectiveness of EEG-based biomarkers.,"Advances in digital technology, signal analysis, and data science have led to a rapid increase in papers reporting EEG-based biomarkers. However, wide heterogeneity in study design and reporting poses challenges in assessing the reliability, validity and utility of these biomarkers. In this evolving field, best practices are sometimes debated but not yet rigorously defined, and the appropriate next step is to ensure that validation-focused research manuscripts report key methodological factors that are known or suspected to influence results. To assist authors in designing and reporting validation studies of EEG biomarkers, and to help editors and regulatory bodies evaluate them, an international working group-under the auspices of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology (IFCN) and in collaboration with the EQUATOR Network-developed the Guidelines for Reporting EEG/Neurophysiology Biomarker Evaluation for Application to Neurology and Neuropsychiatry (GREENBEAN). EEG biomarker validation studies are classified into four phases, similarly to therapeutic studies. Phases 1-2 are preliminary and do not constitute formal validation. Phase 3 studies provide compelling evidence of validity, while phase 4 studies assess the clinical utility and generalizability of previously validated biomarkers within real-world settings. We provide detailed definitions for each phase, along with a checklist of items to address and report. A detailed Explanation and Elaboration document is included in Supplementary Material with multiple examples of how to design and report EEG biomarker studies.

40554363,Hospital frailty risk score in predicting outcomes after simultaneous colon and liver resection for colorectal cancer liver metastasis in older adults: Evidence from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2015-2018.,"This study investigated the impact of clinical frailty on short-term outcomes of simultaneous colorectal cancer (CRC) and colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) resections. Data of older patients ≥ 60 years old undergoing simultaneous CRC/CRLM resections between 2005 and 2018 were identified in the United States (US) Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. Frailty was determined using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) according to the International Classification of Diseases Ninth and Tenth (ICD-9 and ICD-10) codes. Study outcomes included mortality, prolonged hospital stay (LOS), non-routine discharge, and complications. Data of 4514 patients were analyzed. Frailty was significantly associated with increased risks of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.65, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.52, 5.28), non-routine discharge (aOR = 2.44, 95% CI: 2.08, 2.87), prolonged LOS (aOR = 3.07, 95% CI: 2.60, 3.61), overall complications (aOR = 3.47, 95% CI: 3.03, 3.97), sepsis (aOR = 13.73, 95% CI: 9.76, 19.31), respiratory failure (aOR = 4.99, 95% CI: 3.80, 6.57), acute kidney injury (AKI) (aOR = 6.42, 95% CI: 4.83, 8.52), and acute liver failure (aOR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.38, 3.21), as well as 32.69 thousand USD higher total hospital costs (95% CI: 28.41, 36.97) than no frailty. Incorporating frailty with traditional demographic and clinical risk factors improved in-hospital mortality prediction (area under ROC curve [AUC]: 0.765 to 0.799). In older patients aged ≥ 60 years undergoing simultaneous CRC and CRLM resection, HFRS-defined frailty is a significant predictor of adverse in-hospital outcomes. The addition of HFRS-defined frailty to demographic and clinical variables in predictive models improved the AUC for mortality prediction. Incorporating frailty assessment into the preoperative risk stratification and decision-making process for these patients may support surgeons in delivering more personalized and effective care.","The journal of nutrition, health & aging",2025.0,Haohao Huang; Weidong Jin; Huiling Sun; Bo Diao; Ping Wang; Jiankun Jia; Dandan Ma; Yi Zhang,study investigate impact clinical frailty short term outcome simultaneous colorectal cancer crc colorectal cancer liver metastasis crlm resection datum old patient ≥ 60 year old undergo simultaneous crc crlm resection 2005 2018 identify united states nationwide inpatient sample nis database frailty determine hospital frailty risk score hfrs accord international classification diseases ninth tenth icd-9 icd-10 code study outcome include mortality prolonged hospital stay los non routine discharge complication datum 4514 patient analyze frailty significantly associate increase risk hospital mortality adjust odd ratio aor = 3.65 95 confidence interval ci 2.52 5.28 non routine discharge aor = 2.44 95 ci 2.08 2.87 prolonged los aor = 3.07 95 ci 2.60 3.61 overall complication aor = 3.47 95 ci 3.03 3.97 sepsis aor = 13.73 95 ci 9.76 19.31 respiratory failure aor = 4.99 95 ci 3.80 6.57 acute kidney injury aki aor = 6.42 95 ci 4.83 8.52 acute liver failure aor = 2.10 95 ci 1.38 3.21 32.69 thousand usd high total hospital cost 95 ci 28.41 36.97 frailty incorporate frailty traditional demographic clinical risk factor improve hospital mortality prediction area roc curve auc 0.765 0.799 old patient age ≥ 60 year undergo simultaneous crc crlm resection hfrs define frailty significant predictor adverse hospital outcome addition hfrs define frailty demographic clinical variable predictive model improve auc mortality prediction incorporate frailty assessment preoperative risk stratification decision make process patient support surgeon deliver personalized effective care
40554329,Insomnia and emotion dysregulation: a meta-analytical perspective integrating regulatory strategies and dispositional difficulties.,"Insomnia and emotion dysregulation are intricately related, yet their aggregate association across different domains of emotion dysregulation and the effect of moderating factors including health-related status, age, and gender remain unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized data from 57 studies, pooling 119 effect sizes from correlational and 55 effect sizes from group comparison studies. By separate analyses, we assessed both the strength of the association and whether clinically significant insomnia symptoms exacerbate difficulty in regulating emotion. Correlational analyses revealed a significant association between insomnia symptoms and emotion dysregulation, primarily in individuals with serious health-related conditions (Fisher Z<sub>no-serious condition</sub> = 0.22, Fisher Z<sub>serious-conditions</sub> = 0.37, p < 0.00001). Group comparison analyses indicated that clinically significant insomnia symptoms present worse emotion dysregulation regardless of health-related status (Hedges' g = 0.99, p = 0.01). The reliance on maladaptive emotion regulation strategies and difficulties in dispositional domains of emotion regulation, particularly impulsivity, were more strongly associated with insomnia than challenges related to adaptive strategies.

40554236,"Drivers of adolescent chasing behavior: The role of craving, decision-making, alcohol use, and gambling severity.","Craving and impaired decision-making are hallmark features of addiction, playing a prominent role in gambling disorder. These factors are central to loss-chasing behavior, a core diagnostic criterion of gambling dependence characterized by persistent attempts to recover prior losses. This study examines the interplay of craving, affective decision-making, decision-making styles, alcohol use, and gambling severity in chasing behavior among 272 Italian adolescents aged 14-19. Participants completed validated measures, including the South Oaks Gambling Screen-Revised for Adolescents (SOGS-RA), Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), General Decision-Making Style (GDMS), Gambling Craving Scale (GACS), and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Chasing behavior was assessed using a computerized task, with participants randomly assigned to either a Control or Loss condition. Regression and path analyses indicated that craving was the strongest predictor of both chasing initiation and persistence, while alcohol consumption was uniquely associated with greater chasing persistence. Conversely, a dependent decision-making style emerged as a protective factor, being associated with reduced engagement in chasing behavior. Notably, neither gambling severity (measured by the SOGS-RA) nor affective decision-making capacity (assessed via the IGT) predicted chasing outcomes. These findings suggest that chasing operates as an independent behavioral mechanism within gambling disorder, distinct from generalized gambling severity or neurocognitive decision-making deficits.",Addictive behaviors,2025.0,Marina Cosenza; Barbara Pizzini; Maria Ciccarelli; Mariagiulia Sacco; Giovanna Nigro,craving impaired decision making hallmark feature addiction play prominent role gambling disorder factor central loss chase behavior core diagnostic criterion gambling dependence characterize persistent attempt recover prior loss study examine interplay craving affective decision making decision make style alcohol use gambling severity chase behavior 272 italian adolescent age 14 19 participant complete validate measure include south oaks gambling screen revised adolescents sogs ra iowa gambling task igt general decision make style gdms gambling craving scale gacs alcohol use disorders identification test audit chase behavior assess computerized task participant randomly assign control loss condition regression path analysis indicate craving strong predictor chase initiation persistence alcohol consumption uniquely associate great chasing persistence conversely dependent decision make style emerge protective factor associate reduced engagement chase behavior notably gambling severity measure sogs ra affective decision make capacity assess igt predict chase outcome finding suggest chasing operate independent behavioral mechanism gambling disorder distinct generalized gambling severity neurocognitive decision make deficit

40554195,Contribution of activated complements and CD59 to the pathophysiology of Rasmussen syndrome.,"Rasmussen syndrome (RS) is an autoimmune-associated epilepsy with refractory seizures and deteriorating motor and cognitive functions. We expect to unveil complex immunological pathophysiology from the viewpoint of complements to establish newer immunomodulatory treatments. We examined CSF levels of activated complements (iC3b, C5a and soluble membrane attack complex (sMAC)) and CD59 (inhibitor of MAC) using ELISA kits in 36 patients with RS and 44 disease controls (DCs). Disease duration from the onset of RS to CSF examination (mean ± SD) was 80.5 ± 89.7 months (n = 73). Seizure frequency at CSF examination was daily in 56, weekly in four, monthly in six, yearly in four and seizure-free in three CSF samples. The level of iC3b was significantly higher in RS than in DCs, but that of C5a, sMAC or CD59 was not different between RS and DCs. Levels of iC3b increased along with duration of disease. The ratio of patients with the levels of CD59 more than zero increased after the acute stage. Levels of CD59 in patients with daily seizure frequency were significantly lower than those with seizure control.

40554136,Focus on epilepsy and epilepsy syndromes in children with autism spectrum disorders: a study of 74 patients.,"Epilepsy is a common finding in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but few studies describe the characteristics of epilepsy in these children. Our study aimed to characterize the electroclinical features of children with ASD and epilepsy through a retrospective multicenter study. Patients with ASD who subsequently developed epilepsy seen at nine pediatric neurology departments were included. Patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE), chronic neurological diseases with epilepsy who developed autism, and those with non-epileptic paroxysmal disorders were excluded. Overall, 74 patients were included, accounting for 15 % of 494 children with ASD seen between 2015 and 2023; 39 were female (52.7 %) and 35 male (47.3 %). Focal epilepsies were identified in 43 patients (58.1 %), which were non-self-limited in 24 and self-limited in 19. Generalized epilepsies were observed in 19 (25.7 %), including six with generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone (one in childhood, five in adolescence), nine with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, one with childhood absence epilepsy, and three with juvenile absence epilepsy. Eight patients (10.8 %) had epileptic encephalopathies: EE-SWAS in six and epilepsy with myoclonic atonic seizures in two. Four patients (5.4 %) had combined focal and generalized epilepsy. No significant differences were found between epilepsy syndrome or type of epilepsy, seizure type, and comorbidities.

40554101,Endothelial soluble epoxide hydrolase links polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism to oxidative stress and atherosclerosis progression.,"Atheroslcerosis manifests as localized lesions within the vascular tree, preferentially affecting arteries at branch points, the outer wall of bifurcations and the inner walls of curvatures. Such spatial localized sensitivity to atherosclerosis, can be partially attributed to endothelial cell heterogeneity which compromises vascular fitness and contributes to the pathogenesis of the diseases. Here we identified that in a subcluster of aortic endothelial cells characterized with atheroprone gene signatures, the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) metabolic enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is selectively upregulated. Genetic endothelial-specific overexpression of the sEH resulted in excessive and accelerated atherosclerosis development, while inducible endothelial-specific deletion of sEH protected against PCSK9 mediated atherosclerotic plaque formation. Mechanistically, sEH-derived docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) diol (19,20-DHDP) disrupts mitochondrial protein-cholesterol associations in endothelial cells, which through reduced oxidizing metabolic import of pyruvate and malate inhibited mitochondrial Complex I activity. Such inhibition, resulted in a lowering of the mitochondrial membrane potential and subsequent excessive mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and disrupted mitochondrial structure. Heightened mitochondrial redox generation ultimately led to TGFβ activation and the subsequent stimulation of an athroprone and pro-inflammatory endothelial transcriptional programme. Re-establishing redox homeostasis by antioxidant treatments, halted the atheroprone phenotypes of sEH overexpressing vessels. Our data propose that manipulating endothelial PUFA metabolism and sEH activity in the endothelium can exert vascular protective effects.",Redox biology,2025.0,Minghua Cao; Mengqing Li; Xixuan Li; Yuanyuan Li; Yunyun Chen; Maria-Kyriaki Drekolia; Xiang Cheng; Fredy Delgado Lagos; Sofia-Iris Bibli; Jiong Hu,"atheroslcerosis manifest localize lesion vascular tree preferentially affect artery branch point outer wall bifurcation inner wall curvature spatial localize sensitivity atherosclerosis partially attribute endothelial cell heterogeneity compromise vascular fitness contribute pathogenesis disease identify subcluster aortic endothelial cell characterize atheroprone gene signature polyunsaturated fatty acid pufa metabolic enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase seh selectively upregulate genetic endothelial specific overexpression seh result excessive accelerated atherosclerosis development inducible endothelial specific deletion seh protect pcsk9 mediate atherosclerotic plaque formation mechanistically seh derive docosahexaenoic acid dha diol 19,20 dhdp disrupt mitochondrial protein cholesterol association endothelial cell reduce oxidize metabolic import pyruvate malate inhibit mitochondrial complex activity inhibition result lowering mitochondrial membrane potential subsequent excessive mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production disrupt mitochondrial structure heighten mitochondrial redox generation ultimately lead tgfβ activation subsequent stimulation athroprone pro inflammatory endothelial transcriptional programme establish redox homeostasis antioxidant treatment halt atheroprone phenotype seh overexpressing vessel datum propose manipulate endothelial pufa metabolism seh activity endothelium exert vascular protective effect"

The present systematic review aimed to identify disorders in which the prevalence of left-right confusion is higher than in the general population. For this purpose, a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines was conducted using the databases Google Scholar, PubMed, and Mendeley. A total of 20 quantitative case-control studies were included. Lesions in parietal brain areas and damage to temporal-parietal-occipital brain areas because of Alzheimer's disease were associated with severe impairments in left-right orientation. Furthermore, evidence for developmental impairments in direction assignment was provided by studies on developmental topographical disorientation (DTD). These DTD-related impairments are associated with low functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the right prefrontal cortex. Individuals with DTD show significantly poorer performance in direction discrimination compared to healthy subjects. In addition, the review highlights that, despite previous research, there remains a substantial need for further studies and for the development of a uniform definition and operationalization of left-right confusion in clinical populations.",Brain research bulletin,2025.0,Moritz Thaler; Sebastian Ocklenburg,left right confusion common healthy individual increase prevalence report psychiatric neurodevelopmental neurological disorder present systematic review aim identify disorder prevalence left right confusion high general population purpose systematic review follow prisma guideline conduct database google scholar pubmed mendeley total 20 quantitative case control study include lesion parietal brain area damage temporal parietal occipital brain area alzheimer disease associate severe impairment left right orientation furthermore evidence developmental impairment direction assignment provide study developmental topographical disorientation dtd dtd relate impairment associate low functional connectivity hippocampus right prefrontal cortex individual dtd significantly poor performance direction discrimination compare healthy subject addition review highlight despite previous research remain substantial need study development uniform definition operationalization left right confusion clinical population

40553926,"A critical role for the Fascin family of actin bundling proteins in axon development, brain wiring and function.","Actin-based cell motility drives many neurodevelopmental events including guided axonal growth. Fascin is a major family of F-actin bundling proteins, but its role in axon development in vivo and brain wiring remains unclear. Here, we report that fascin is required for axon development, brain wiring and function. We show that fascin is enriched in the motile filopodia of axonal growth cones and its inhibition impairs axonal extension and branching of hippocampal neurons in culture. We next provide evidence that fascin is essential for axon development and brain wiring in vivo using Drosophila melanogaster as a model. Drosophila expresses a single ortholog of mammalian fascin called Singed (SN), which is expressed in the mushroom body (MB) of the central nervous system. Loss of SN causes severe MB disruption, marked by α- and β-lobe defects indicative of altered axonal guidance. SN-null flies also exhibit defective sensorimotor behaviors as assessed by the negative geotaxis assay. MB-specific expression of SN in SN-null flies rescues MB structure and sensorimotor deficits, indicating that SN functions autonomously in MB neurons. Together, our data from primary neuronal culture and in vivo models highlight a critical role for fascin in brain development and function.",Molecular and cellular neurosciences,2025.0,Katherine R Hardin; Arjolyn B Penas; Shuristeen Joubert; Changtian Ye; Kenneth R Myers; James Q Zheng,actin base cell motility drive neurodevelopmental event include guide axonal growth fascin major family f actin bundling protein role axon development vivo brain wiring remain unclear report fascin require axon development brain wiring function fascin enrich motile filopodia axonal growth cone inhibition impairs axonal extension branching hippocampal neuron culture provide evidence fascin essential axon development brain wiring vivo drosophila melanogaster model drosophila express single ortholog mammalian fascin call singed sn express mushroom body mb central nervous system loss sn cause severe mb disruption mark α- β lobe defect indicative altered axonal guidance sn null fly exhibit defective sensorimotor behavior assess negative geotaxis assay mb specific expression sn sn null fly rescue mb structure sensorimotor deficit indicate sn function autonomously mb neuron datum primary neuronal culture vivo model highlight critical role fascin brain development function

40553905,Sleep Disorders and Sleep Medications as Risk Factors for Dementia in Kidney Transplant Recipients: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Older (aged≥55 years) kidney transplant (KT) recipients diagnosed with a sleep disorder after transplantation may be at increased risk for developing dementia. Using USRDS/Medicare claims (2010-2020), we identified 16,573 older KT recipients with a functioning graft 1-year post-KT. First-time sleep disorders and newly prescribed sleep medications were ascertained within the first year post-KT. We used cause-specific hazard models to estimate the hazard ratio (aHR) of diagnosed dementia with inverse probability of treatment weights. Overall, 3,615 (21.8%) KT recipients were newly diagnosed with sleep disorders. Recipients diagnosed with a sleep disorder had a 1.32-fold increased risk for dementia (95%CI:1.15-1.51); those with insomnia had a 1.56-fold increased risk (95%CI:1.20-2.03). Of those diagnosed with insomnia, only 7.5% underwent cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). 12.9% of recipients with a sleep disorder were prescribed sleep medications. Recipients prescribed sleep medication had a 1.44-fold increased risk for dementia (95%CI:1.16-1.77).

Recent studies have demonstrated that MNPs not only enter the human body through multiple pathways but may also cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), causing irreversible toxic damage to the central nervous system (CNS). This review summarizes the possible mechanisms of MNPs crossing the BBB, including the disruption of tight junctions and adherens juctions, paracellular transport, and endocytosis pathways. We focused on investigating the key roles of oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, mitochondrial dysfunction, and iron metabolism disorders in MNP-induced neurotoxicity, and discovered significant interconnections among these mechanisms. Furthermore, as carriers of pollutants, MNPs can facilitate co-exposure with other environmental contaminants such as heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants, producing synergistic toxic effects that further aggravate neurological damage. This review synthesizes the main research progress in this field, evaluates the potential toxicological impacts of MNPs on the CNS, and identifies key scientific questions that need to be addressed in future research, thereby providing theoretical foundations for in-depth studies of MNP neurotoxicity mechanisms and risk assessment.",Neurotoxicology,2025.0,Yu Ma; Haitao Yang; Shuyan Niu; Menghao Guo; Yuying Xue,micro- nanoplastic mnps emerge global pollutant pose increase threat ecological environment human health widespread distribution potential toxicity recent study demonstrate mnp enter human body multiple pathway cross blood brain barrier bbb cause irreversible toxic damage central nervous system cns review summarize possible mechanism mnp cross bbb include disruption tight junction adheren juction paracellular transport endocytosis pathway focus investigate key role oxidative stress inflammatory response mitochondrial dysfunction iron metabolism disorder mnp induce neurotoxicity discover significant interconnection mechanism furthermore carrier pollutant mnp facilitate co exposure environmental contaminant heavy metal persistent organic pollutant produce synergistic toxic effect aggravate neurological damage review synthesize main research progress field evaluate potential toxicological impact mnp cns identify key scientific question need address future research provide theoretical foundation depth study mnp neurotoxicity mechanism risk assessment

This study investigates the influence of microplastics on the gut microbiome composition and assess subsequent alterations in the cephalic transcriptome, feeding patterns, and overall behaviour of the organism. D. magna individuals were exposed to low and high levels of bioplastic particles and kaolin natural particles and under starving conditions. Feeding and behavioral effects were assessed using previously well-established assays. Changes in gut microbiome composition, cephalic transcription and their functional interpretation were studied by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and cephalic D magna RNA high-throughput sequencing, respectively, and using appropriate bioinformatic pipelines. Only exposures to high concentrations of bioplastic microparticles inhibited feeding and impacted behavioural responses in D. magna, resembling effects observed under starvation. Microbiome analysis revealed shifts in taxonomic composition and functional profiles across the tested microplastic concentrations, which become more notable at higher ones. Functional changes in the gut microbiome indicated that bioplastics at high concentrations altered to a greater extent short-chain fatty acid biosynthesis and tryptophan and L-glutamate metabolism pathways than at low concentrations. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that microplastics up-regulated neurological pathways, cell turnover, and differentiation. In summary exposure to microplastics resulted in gut dysbiosis and increased biosynthesis of short-chain fatty acid signalling pathways in the gut, altered neurological pathways in the cephalic transcriptome and disrupted behavioural responses, altogether supporting the role of the microbiota-gut-brain crosstalk on neurological disorders.","Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2025.0,María Paula Carrillo; Maria Vila-Costa; Carlos Barata,role gut microbiome brain axis contaminant effect invertebrate limit poor knowledge gut microbiome neurological regulatory pathway study investigate influence microplastic gut microbiome composition assess subsequent alteration cephalic transcriptome feed pattern overall behaviour organism d. magna individual expose low high level bioplastic particle kaolin natural particle starve condition feeding behavioral effect assess previously establish assay change gut microbiome composition cephalic transcription functional interpretation study 16s rrna gene sequence cephalic d magna rna high throughput sequencing respectively appropriate bioinformatic pipeline exposure high concentration bioplastic microparticle inhibit feeding impact behavioural response d. magna resemble effect observe starvation microbiome analysis reveal shift taxonomic composition functional profile test microplastic concentration notable high one functional change gut microbiome indicate bioplastic high concentration alter great extent short chain fatty acid biosynthesis tryptophan l glutamate metabolism pathway low concentration transcriptomic analysis reveal microplastic regulate neurological pathway cell turnover differentiation summary exposure microplastic result gut dysbiosis increase biosynthesis short chain fatty acid signal pathway gut alter neurological pathway cephalic transcriptome disrupt behavioural response altogether support role microbiota gut brain crosstalk neurological disorder

In recent years, several studies have focused on the role of the microbiome-gut-brain-axis (MGBA) in its etiology, providing several novel insights. The communication within MGBA involves various pathways leading through the vagus nerve and the bloodstream mediators. The latter are represented by short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), produced by gut microbiota from dietary fiber. To date, several physiological and pathophysiological roles in the periphery and the central nervous system for SCFAs have been suggested. Studies investigating gut microbiota have consistently reported a decreased abundance of bacteria-producing SCFAs in people with mood and schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Yet, studies investigating faecal and blood levels of SCFAs have provided mixed findings.

40553540,Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis with Renal Tubular Acidosis in a Patient with Autoimmune Disorder.,"Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HPP) is characterized by transient episodes of skeletal muscle weakness due to hypokalemia. It can arise from primary or secondary causes, with renal tubular acidosis (RTA) being a notable secondary etiology. Here, we present a case of HPP associated with RTA in a patient with an underlying autoimmune disorder, Sjögren syndrome. A 29-year-old female presented with dry eyes and progressive weakness in both upper and lower limbs, leading to immobilization. Clinical examination revealed hypokalemia, normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, and alkaline urinary pH consistent with RTA type I. Immunological tests indicated markers suggestive of Sjögren syndrome. Treatment with potassium chloride resulted in motor function improvement. The coexistence of HPP and RTA underscores the complex interplay between electrolyte disturbances and autoimmune pathology. Sjögren syndrome, an autoimmune exocrinopathy, can manifest with extraglandular involvement, including RTA. The diagnosis was supported by clinical, biochemical, and immunological findings. This case highlights the clinical significance of recognizing HPP as a potential differential diagnosis in patients presenting with limb weakness, particularly in the context of autoimmune disorders such as Sjögren syndrome.

40553538,Unveiling the Psychiatric and Neurological Manifestations of Idiopathic Hypoparathyroidism: A Case of Auditory Hallucinations and Seizure Disorder.,"Idiopathic hypoparathyroidism (IHP) is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by hypocalcemia, leading to a diverse array of neurological and psychiatric manifestations. The emergence of psychiatric symptoms, particularly those that mirror primary psychiatric disorders, creates considerable difficulties in achieving a precise diagnosis and effective treatment. A 35-year-old female patient was admitted with status epilepticus and a documented history of psychiatric illness. Initial investigations revealed hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyperphosphatemia. A noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head showed striopallidodentate calcification, a characteristic finding in hypoparathyroidism. The patient reported persistent auditory hallucinations for the past 3 years, which were unresponsive to antipsychotic treatment. Additionally, she had a very low serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. Notably, the patient had no history of neck surgery, autoimmune disorders, cancers, radiation therapy, or infiltrative disorders such as hemochromatosis. There were no other congenital abnormalities or family history of similar illnesses. A diagnosis of IHP was established based on the patient's clinical symptoms and the results of the investigations. Calcium and magnesium supplements were started to correct the deficiencies of hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia. Antiepileptic drugs were administered to control seizures. Despite the normalization of serum calcium levels, the patient's auditory hallucinations persisted, indicating a possible need for alternative therapeutic approaches. This report emphasizes the need to consider IHP when diagnosing patients who present with ongoing psychiatric symptoms and seizures. The persistence of auditory hallucinations despite corrected hypocalcemia highlights the complexity of managing psychiatric manifestations in IHP.

40553529,Guillain-Barré Syndrome in India: A Call for Learning and Cohesive Action.,"In January 2025, a Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) outbreak was reported in Pune, which quickly spread to other states of India. Though GBS is a rare immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy, it is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis globally. Initially described in 1859, knowledge on pathophysiology, disease spectrum, and management has evolved with time. GBS typically develops postinfection, with symptoms emerging within 6 weeks of the infectious trigger. Clinically, GBS commonly presents with bilateral flaccid weakness, often following a monophasic course. However, multiple clinical variants and atypical presentations often lead to delay in diagnosis. Diagnosis of GBS is primarily clinical, with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and electrodiagnostic tests having a supportive role. The concept of ""time is nerve"" should be rooted in practice, and immunomodulatory therapy either as intravenous immune globulin (IVIg) or plasma exchange should be initiated at the earliest. Monitoring for respiratory and autonomic function is critical in management, with specific clinical parameters guiding intensive care unit (ICU) transfer. Overall, holistic and multidisciplinary supportive care is key to reduce patient morbidity and mortality.

40553526,Dental Health in People Living with Epilepsy.,"With major attention paid to the most evidently manifested illness like a seizure, few of the silent and deep-boring illnesses like dental issues are often neglected. This study has aimed to analyze the dental illness in people living with epilepsy (PWE). This was a prospective, single-center, case-control study conducted among PWE and their family members from March to May 2022. A survey on demographic parameters, dental hygiene practices, and symptoms of dental illness was taken, followed by a detailed dental examination of the study participants. Independent <i>t</i> -test was used to compare dental illness among PWE and controls. A total of 69 patients were included, with a mean age of 32.5 ± 2.4 years, and 45 (63%) patients were symptomatic with dental issues. Patients from higher socioeconomic status were found to have better dental hygiene practices but also had a higher prevalence of wasting disease of teeth. About 67 of 69 PWE and 19 of 33 controls were found to have dental illness. PWE had a higher degree of asymptomatic soft tissue abnormalities (24 vs 0%, <i>p</i> < 0.0001) and periodontal disease (13 vs 7.4%, <i>p</i> < 0.0001) as compared to controls.

The present research intends to examine the neurocognitive functions in PLHIV, compared to healthy volunteers. About 48 HIV patients were recruited from one tertiary health care center, while 24 matched healthy volunteers were enrolled as controls from the community. Neurocognitive functions were assessed using the Hindi Mental Status Examination (HMSE), Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE)-III, and International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS) questionnaires, along with the computer-based color-word Stroop cognitive task. The total HMSE scores (<i>p</i> = 0.0047), IHDS scores (<i>p</i> = 0.0002), and ACE-III scores (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) were statistically lower in PLHIV, compared to controls. The specific domain scores of ACE-III in PLHIV were also statistically lower compared to the control group, with greater differences seen in memory (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) and language (<i>p</i> = 0.0012) domains. Similarly, higher reaction time was seen in PLHIV in comparison with the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) during Stroop cognitive task performance, while a statistically significant difference in accuracy was not observed among groups. Further, among PLHIV, reaction time had a significant positive correlation with years since diagnosis of HIV infection (<i>p</i> = 0.006, <i>r</i> = 0.39, Spearman correlation).

40553520,A Comparative Study of Risk Factors across Young and Old Acute Ischemic Strokes: A Hospital-based Study in North India.,"Stroke is an important cause of death and disability. Prevalence of stroke differs with age. The risk factors in young differ in comparison to the old age-group. In this study, risk factors of stroke in young are compared to the old age-group. To compare the established risk factors in young and old acute ischemic strokes. The study was conducted at the neurosciences department of Santokba Durlabhji Memorial Hospital, Jaipur, a tertiary referral center in North India, from June 2015 to December 2016. It was a hospital-based analytical type of observational, cross-sectional study. One hundred fifty stroke patients above 18 years of age were included in young (<50 years) or old age (>50 years) groups. The risk factors of stroke were defined in terms of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, ischemic heart diseases, valvular heart disease, history of transient ischemic attack or stroke, smoking, oral contraceptive pill, raised serum homocysteine, and low serum vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels. Of 150 patients, 75 patients were in the young stroke group and 75 patients in the old stroke group. Out of these 150 patients, 66.67% were males and 33.33% were female patients. The mean age (in years) of young patients was 41.64, while in old stroke patients it was 65.8. Thirty-eight percent in the young group and 72% in the old group had hypertension. Diabetes was found in 16% and 32% in the young and old group, respectively. High serum homocysteine was seen in 64% young and 73% old. Low serum vitamin B<sub>12</sub> was found in 25% young and 32% old. Venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) was reactive in 1.3% in young and 4% in old. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) was positive in 6.6% in young and 2.6% in old. From those tested, antiphospholipid antibody (APLA) was positive in 3.64% in young and 4.16% in old. Cardioembolic stroke was found equally in old as in young. The number of patients with rheumatic heart disease showed comparatively higher numbers in the young group, while atrial fibrillation was higher in the old age-group, signifying the importance of detailed cardiac workup and Holter monitoring in the old age-group when indicated. Serum vitamin B12 and homocysteine levels should be done routinely in the evaluation of ischemic stroke irrespective of the age of onset of stroke(s), as their levels were impaired equally in both young and old age-groups in our study. Dyslipidemia, traditionally regarded as a risk factor in old, also showed deranged values in the form of raised serum cholesterol and triglycerides in both age-groups. Positive VDRL, ANA, and APLA showed an increased trend in the old age-group in our study compared to the young age-group.

40553493,<i>PIK3CA</i> gain-of-function mutation in Schwann cells leads to severe neuropathy and aerobic glycolysis through a non-cell autonomous effect.,"<i>PIK3CA</i>-related disorders are rare genetic disorders due to somatic gain-of-function mutations in <i>PIK3CA</i> during embryonic development, a pathway involved in cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism. Accumulating evidence from patients with <i>PIK3CA</i>-related disorders indicates that peripheral nerves are frequently affected, leading to severe neurological symptoms. However, the exact underlying mechanism of these disorders remains unclear. To address this, we developed a mouse model with a <i>PIK3CA</i> gain-of-function mutation specifically in Schwann cells, which successfully mirrored the clinical features observed in patients. In this model, we observed that <i>PIK3CA</i>-mutated cells communicate with neighboring healthy cells, such as adipocytes and hair follicles, through a unique crosstalk mechanism that triggers their growth, proliferation, and anagen phase expansion. Additionally, we demonstrated that <i>PIK3CA</i> mutation in peripheral nerves leads to a metabolic shift through glycolytic activation. We investigated the effects of alpelisib, an approved pharmacological inhibitor of PIK3CA, in the model. Early administration of alpelisib significantly improved the signs and symptoms in the mice. However, when treatment was delayed, its efficacy was diminished due to the drug's inability to penetrate the myelin sheath effectively. In summary, our study offers a valuable mouse model for studying <i>PIK3CA</i>-related neuropathy, uncovers a unique communication between healthy and affected tissues, and highlights the potential benefits of early pharmacological intervention using alpelisib.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2025.0,Quitterie Venot; Marina Firpion; Sophia Ladraa; Charles Bayard; Sato Magassa; Roberta Di Guardo; Antoine Fraissenon; Clément Hoguin; Sanela Protic; Gabriel Morin; Franck Mayeux; Genevieve Gourdon; Sylvie Fraitag; Estelle Balducci; Sophie Kaltenbach; Patrick Villarese; Vahid Asnafi; Thomas Viel; Gwennhael Autret; Bertrand Tavitian; Nicolas Goudin; Laurent Guibaud; Alessandra Bolino; Guillaume Canaud,< > pik3ca</i>-relate disorder rare genetic disorder somatic gain function mutation < > pik3ca</i > embryonic development pathway involve cell growth proliferation metabolism accumulate evidence patient < > pik3ca</i>-relate disorder indicate peripheral nerve frequently affect lead severe neurological symptom exact underlying mechanism disorder remain unclear address develop mouse model < > pik3ca</i > gain function mutation specifically schwann cell successfully mirror clinical feature observe patient model observe < > pik3ca</i>-mutate cell communicate neighbor healthy cell adipocyte hair follicle unique crosstalk mechanism trigger growth proliferation anagen phase expansion additionally demonstrate < > pik3ca</i > mutation peripheral nerve lead metabolic shift glycolytic activation investigate effect alpelisib approve pharmacological inhibitor pik3ca model early administration alpelisib significantly improve sign symptom mouse treatment delay efficacy diminish drug inability penetrate myelin sheath effectively summary study offer valuable mouse model study < > pik3ca</i>-related neuropathy uncover unique communication healthy affected tissue highlight potential benefit early pharmacological intervention alpelisib
40553484,Long-Term Multiparameter Sensing Integrated On-Chip Ultrasound for Epileptic Neuron Modulation.,"Ultrasound neuromodulation holds great potential for treating neurological disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its effects remain unclear. There is a lack of systematic safety evaluation and standardized quantification of therapeutic outcomes. To address these challenges, this study integrates on-chip ultrasound with multiparameter cellular monitoring to quantitatively assess the therapeutic effects of various ultrasound parameters on neurological diseases from both electrophysiological and metabolic perspectives. Long-term monitoring is employed for a comprehensive evaluation of ultrasound safety. Notably, the combination of high-resolution, synchronous signal monitoring and biochemical indicators provides a deeper and more thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in ultrasound neuromodulation. Furthermore, using an on-chip epileptic neuron model, it is demonstrated that epileptic neurons exhibit high-frequency firing and synchronized oscillations in excitability, temperature, intracellular calcium, and mitochondrial calcium concentrations. The application of on-chip ultrasound effectively suppresses epileptiform discharges in neurons and inhibits both these oscillations and neuronal bursting events. When tuning with acoustic enhancer sodium valproate-loaded nanobubbles, the antiepileptic therapy effect can be significantly enhanced by maintaining mitochondrial calcium homeostasis. By integrating multiparameter long-term monitoring with on-chip ultrasound, this study presents an advanced approach for investigating the mechanisms of ultrasound neuromodulation, facilitating standardized evaluation and long-term safety assessment.",ACS sensors,2025.0,Yongxu Ju; Xiao Wang; Yang Liu; Chuan Chen; Fang Yang,ultrasound neuromodulation hold great potential treat neurological disorder molecular mechanism underlie effect remain unclear lack systematic safety evaluation standardized quantification therapeutic outcome address challenge study integrate chip ultrasound multiparameter cellular monitoring quantitatively assess therapeutic effect ultrasound parameter neurological disease electrophysiological metabolic perspective long term monitoring employ comprehensive evaluation ultrasound safety notably combination high resolution synchronous signal monitoring biochemical indicator provide deep thorough understanding molecular mechanism involve ultrasound neuromodulation furthermore chip epileptic neuron model demonstrate epileptic neuron exhibit high frequency firing synchronize oscillation excitability temperature intracellular calcium mitochondrial calcium concentration application chip ultrasound effectively suppresse epileptiform discharge neuron inhibit oscillation neuronal burst event tune acoustic enhancer sodium valproate load nanobubble antiepileptic therapy effect significantly enhance maintain mitochondrial calcium homeostasis integrate multiparameter long term monitoring chip ultrasound study present advanced approach investigate mechanism ultrasound neuromodulation facilitate standardized evaluation long term safety assessment
40553407,Neuropsychological outcome in pediatric brain tumor survivors treated with proton radiation prior to age 4 years.,"Pediatric brain tumor survivors (PBTS) treated with radiation at a very young age are at risk for adverse neuropsychological outcomes. This retrospective cross-sectional study examined outcomes and educational service utilization in 45 PBTS treated with proton radiation therapy (PRT) before age 4. PBTS and their parents were administered measures at ≥ 1 year post-PRT. Areas assessed: intelligence, emotional, behavioral, adaptive, and executive functioning. Age-based scores were compared to normative means, rates of impairment were calculated, and demographic/clinical factors and educational service utilization were examined. Median age at PRT was 2.58 years. Median interval to follow-up was 2.42 years. All received daily anesthesia during PRT and most received focal PRT (88.9%), had infratentorial tumors (71.1%), received chemotherapy (62.2%), and had sensory/motor deficits (51.1%). All mean standard/T-scores were in the average range. However, mean scores were significantly different from normative data and rates of impairment were notably elevated in withdrawal, anxiety, activities of daily living, shifting, working memory, and adaptive skills. Mean scores and rates of impairment were significantly lower (fewer problems) in aggression and conduct problems. Scores were comparable to the norm in attention, hyperactivity, depression, social skills, inhibition, and emotional control. More than half (62.2%) received special education services/accommodations; patients with sensory/motor deficits received more services/accommodations. Gender, tumor location, chemotherapy, and socioeconomic status were not significantly related to outcome. Neuropsychological outcomes for PBTS treated with PRT before age 4 are encouraging, although there are some areas of concern.

40553336,Recent Developments in the Application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Early Screening and Diagnosis of Autism.,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD or Autism) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by challenges in social communication skills and the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviors during early childhood. ASD poses a significant public health challenge with increasing prevalence rates worldwide. Early diagnosis and intervention are critical for improving outcomes in children with ASD. However, current diagnostic methods often involve subjective assessments and are time-consuming. Currently, there are no known biomarkers for ASD, and the diagnosis is based on phenotypic manifestations observed by trained clinicians over time. Additionally, the heterogeneity of Autism and associated co-occurring conditions pose further challenges for screening and early detection. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are transforming ASD screening and diagnosis. These computational technologies are capable of analyzing complex datasets and multiple modalities, including multi-omics, brain images, behavior assessments, medical and background information, and registry data to identify patterns that may not be evident to clinicians or parents.

Instead, MRI uses radio waves and a strong magnetic field to construct detailed cross-sectional images of various parts of the body, including the brain and spine. Magnetization transfer MRI is a well-established medical imaging technique based on the underlying physics of nuclear magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between water and macromolecules in a relaxation mechanism. Here we use this technique to acquire MRI images of human glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, and brain metastasis tumors in a patient-derived orthotopic xenograft model.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2025.0,Manoj Singh; Chitra Venugopal; Sheila K Singh,magnetic resonance imaging mri establish medical imaging technique visualize internal structure body use ionize radiation instead mri use radio wave strong magnetic field construct detailed cross sectional image part body include brain spine magnetization transfer mri establish medical imaging technique base underlie physics nuclear magnetic dipole dipole interaction water macromolecule relaxation mechanism use technique acquire mri image human glioblastoma medulloblastoma brain metastasis tumor patient derive orthotopic xenograft model

40553290,An In Vivo Model of Recurrent Glioblastoma.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive and prevalent adult brain tumor. Despite an intensive standard of care consisting of surgical resection followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide, patients invariably succumb to the recurrent tumor and face an overall survival of less than 15 months. Recurrent GBM often differs greatly from the primary counterparts and show greater resistance to genotoxic therapies. Despite these differences and implications this treatment resistance has, recurrent GBM remains relatively understudied due to the paucity of samples and a previous lack of interest in the field. In this chapter, we describe an in vivo xenograft model recapitulating the standard of care with radiation therapy and temozolomide, and the subsequent development of recurrent GBM.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2025.0,Muhammad Vaseem Shaikh; Benjamin Brakel; Alisha Anand; Chitra Venugopal; Sheila K Singh,glioblastoma gbm highly aggressive prevalent adult brain tumor despite intensive standard care consist surgical resection follow radiation therapy chemotherapy temozolomide patient invariably succumb recurrent tumor face overall survival 15 month recurrent gbm differ greatly primary counterpart great resistance genotoxic therapy despite difference implication treatment resistance recurrent gbm remain relatively understudied paucity sample previous lack interest field chapter describe vivo xenograft model recapitulate standard care radiation therapy temozolomide subsequent development recurrent gbm
40553289,Modeling Glioma Stem Cell-Mediated Tumorigenesis Using Zebrafish Patient-Derived Xenograft Systems.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor associated with high post-therapy recurrence and very poor survival rates. One of the factors contributing to the aggressive nature of this disease is the level of heterogeneity seen at the phenotypic and genetic level. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) are stem-like cells within the tumor with the ability to self-renew and give rise to different types of cells within the tumor, hence giving rise to the heterogeneity found in GBM. GSCs are often implicated in the resistance of glioma to standard of care radiation and chemotherapy. The physical niche within a tumor mass supports stemness and aggressive characteristics of GSCs, hence, experimental systems providing a relevant tumor microenvironment (TME) are critical for adequate assessment of molecular mechanisms regulating GSC populations. Although mouse models continue to be an integral part of an in vivo experimental design, they are neither time- nor cost-efficient. Danio rerio (zebrafish) patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) overcome several of the obstacles of the mammalian systems. Zebrafish constitute a robust, easily reproducible experimental model allowing for relevant investigation of GSC populations with TME. This chapter describes methods required for generation of zebrafish PDXs to study aspects of GSC-mediated tumorigenesis and interactions with the TME.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2025.0,Hema Priya Mahendran; Alan Cieslukowski; Dorota Lubanska; Nicholas Philbin; Keith F Stringer; Philip Habashy; Mat Stover; Samira Bashiri; Ana C deCarvalho; Mohamed A R Soliman; Abdalla Shamisa; Lisa A Porter,glioblastoma gbm aggressive brain tumor associate high post therapy recurrence poor survival rate factor contribute aggressive nature disease level heterogeneity see phenotypic genetic level glioma stem cell gscs stem like cell tumor ability self renew rise different type cell tumor give rise heterogeneity find gbm gsc implicate resistance glioma standard care radiation chemotherapy physical niche tumor mass support stemness aggressive characteristic gsc experimental system provide relevant tumor microenvironment tme critical adequate assessment molecular mechanism regulate gsc population mouse model continue integral vivo experimental design time- cost efficient danio rerio zebrafish patient derive xenograft pdxs overcome obstacle mammalian system zebrafish constitute robust easily reproducible experimental model allow relevant investigation gsc population tme chapter describe method require generation zebrafish pdx study aspect gsc mediate tumorigenesis interaction tme

40553287,A Toolkit for Single-Nucleus Characterization of Glioblastoma.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary adult brain tumor. It represents a rapidly evolving ecosystem, including heterogeneous tumor cells and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) with diverse non-malignant cells. High-throughput single-cell omics profiling, such as single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq, respectively), is an emerging powerful tool to deconvolute diverse cell types and states as well as intricate cellular and molecular functions and interactions that underlie the complex GBM ecosystem. snRNA-seq is a methodology that profiles the transcriptome using isolated nuclei instead of intact cells. It is an alternative to scRNA-seq and is compatible with frozen samples and difficult-to-dissociate tissues, such as brain or brain tumor tissues. However, efficient, optimized procedures are instrumental in preparing high-quality single nuclei from clinical GBM specimens and patient-derived GBM cell lines across different conditions for snRNA-seq.

40553281,Patient-Derived Glioblastoma Explants Empower Rapid and Personalized Drug Assessment: Harnessing the Potential of 3D Perfusion Bioreactors in Glioblastoma Drug Discovery.,"Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults, is resistant to Standard of Care (SOC) therapy and almost all available therapies. Clinical trials have not been successful in improving patients' survival, which underscores an urgent need for developing new effective therapies for this treatment-refractory disease. Considering the significant inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity existing in GBM, assessment of therapies in a personalized manner would allow for assigning patients to effective targeted therapies suitable for each patient's unique tumor signature.Patient-tailored ex vivo drug response platform for GBM allows for therapy planning in a personalized manner and enables the discovery of biomarkers of response. Advanced 3D methodologies have shown high efficacy in assessing the effect of therapeutics on intact tumor tissues immediately following tumor resection, allowing for studying the effect of therapies on tumor as a whole followed by detailed analysis of interactions between tumor cells and their microenvironment pre- and post-treatment.Here we describe the use of 3D perfusion bioreactors for translational assessment of therapeutics on regionally annotated patient-derived GBM explants. This model system provides the possibility of generating a 3D dynamic culture with continuous exposure and delivery of drug candidates to an intact tumor tissue material providing crucial insights on treatment-induced mechanisms and facilitating the identification of biomarkers of response, paving the way toward designing and generating more effective therapeutic interventions for GBM patients.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2025.0,Nazanin Tatari; Manuele G Muraro; Hayget Mohamed Seid Hedad; Gregor Hutter,glioblastoma gbm common malignant primary brain tumor adult resistant standard care soc therapy available therapy clinical trial successful improve patient survival underscore urgent need develop new effective therapy treatment refractory disease consider significant inter- intratumoral heterogeneity exist gbm assessment therapy personalized manner allow assign patient effective target therapy suitable patient unique tumor signature patient tailor ex vivo drug response platform gbm allow therapy planning personalized manner enable discovery biomarker response advanced 3d methodology show high efficacy assess effect therapeutic intact tumor tissue immediately follow tumor resection allow study effect therapy tumor follow detailed analysis interaction tumor cell microenvironment pre- post treatment describe use 3d perfusion bioreactor translational assessment therapeutic regionally annotate patient derive gbm explant model system provide possibility generate 3d dynamic culture continuous exposure delivery drug candidate intact tumor tissue material provide crucial insight treatment induce mechanism facilitate identification biomarker response pave way design generate effective therapeutic intervention gbm patient

40553279,Proximity Ligation Assay.,"The Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) is a powerful method for visualizing protein-protein interactions with high specificity and sensitivity. By tethering DNA probes to antibodies directed against two target proteins, the PLA enables the detection of protein complexes within a 40-nm range. Upon colocalization of the target proteins, the DNA probes can anneal a connector oligonucleotide, initiating rolling circle amplification and generating a fluorescent signal detectable by microscopy. Here, we describe a detailed protocol for conducting a PLA in patient-derived tumor cells to visualize protein colocalization of two proteins in situ by fluorescence microscopy. With its ability to accurately capture protein-protein interactions and spatial organization within cells, the PLA is a valuable tool for insights into molecular mechanisms underlying brain tumor progression.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2025.0,Shan Grewal; Shawn C Chafe; Chitra Venugopal; Sheila K Singh,proximity ligation assay pla powerful method visualize protein protein interaction high specificity sensitivity tether dna probe antibody direct target protein pla enable detection protein complex 40 nm range colocalization target protein dna probe anneal connector oligonucleotide initiate rolling circle amplification generate fluorescent signal detectable microscopy describe detailed protocol conduct pla patient derive tumor cell visualize protein colocalization protein situ fluorescence microscopy ability accurately capture protein protein interaction spatial organization cell pla valuable tool insight molecular mechanism underlie brain tumor progression
40553278,Profiling Glioma Stem Cell Dynamics via 3D-Based Cell Cycle Reporter Assays.,"Successful containment of unwanted cell cycle progression in tumors such as glioblastoma (GBM) requires targeted therapeutic approaches, which rely on understanding cell cycle dynamics in response to microenvironmental stimuli. Glioma Stem Cells (GSCs) can drive tumor initiation, recurrence, therapy resistance, and are often attributed to the heterogeneity and plasticity of GBM. In vitro models, using patient-derived GSCs, provide a life relevant tool for exploration of complex molecular mechanisms underlying the aggressive characteristics of GBM. Introduction of 3D tissue culture systems permits the study of spatial complexity of the tumor mass and enables control over diverse conditions within the surrounding microenvironment. This chapter demonstrates detailed methods to study spatiotemporal changes to the cell cycle dynamics using available fluorescent cell cycle reporter systems in combination with bioinformatics-based signal intensity and localization analysis. We present a successful approach that investigates the 3D cell cycle dynamics of GSC populations.

40553277,O<sup>6</sup>-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) Promoter Methylation Analysis in Glioblastoma Patients.,"The alkylating agent temozolomide is used to treat patients who have glioblastoma. However, treatment is only effective when O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase is silenced in the cancer cells. The best way to assess whether or not a patient will be responsive to treatment is to determine if the promoter region of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene is methylated. Similarly, knowing the methylation status of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter in patient -derived brain tumor initiating cells can help guide research. Here we describe how to determine the methylation status in vitro using bisulfite conversion followed by methylation-specific PCR.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2025.0,Petar Miletic; Benjamin Brakel; Chitra Venugopal; Sheila K Singh,alkylate agent temozolomide treat patient glioblastoma treatment effective o6 methylguanine dna methyltransferase silence cancer cell good way assess patient responsive treatment determine promoter region o6 methylguanine dna methyltransferase gene methylate similarly know methylation status o6 methylguanine dna methyltransferase promoter patient -derive brain tumor initiate cell help guide research describe determine methylation status vitro bisulfite conversion follow methylation specific pcr
40553276,Extracellular Flux Assays for the Measurement of Glycolysis and Mitochondrial Respiration in Brain Cancer Cells.,"Several essential biological processes, such as cell growth, survival, and death, are regulated by cellular metabolism. Both normal and cancer cells exhibit metabolic flexibility to adjust to changes in the energy demand in response to alterations in their external microenvironment. This metabolic plasticity is more pronounced in cancer cells, which often reprogram their metabolism to promote their growth and survival. Extracellular flux analysis is a powerful and widely used technique to study cellular metabolism in real time. This approach provides dynamic and functional insights into two key bioenergetic pathways: glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), under both normal and stressed conditions in live cells. In this chapter, we discuss different extracellular flux assays for assessing glycolytic activity, including the glycolysis stress test (GST) and glycolytic rate assay (GRA), as well as OXPHOS using cell mito stress test (MST) with the Agilent Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer.

The patient was assessed using the Psychodynamic Chart in the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual and the Referential Process language measures, which were applied to the early and middle treatment sessions. At the beginning of treatment, the patient presented with comorbid somatizing and schizoid personality disorders, and strong obsessive and anxiety-avoidant traits. He displayed significant impairments in capacity for mentalization; affective range; communication and understanding; self-esteem regulation; and relational intimacy. The patient met criteria for severe BDD. His speech showed a markedly abstract and intellectualized linguistic style that indicated great difficulty in connecting emotional experience to images and words. The therapist's interventions were adapted to this style and were characterized by continuous prompts and suggestions aimed at linking elements and supporting a symbolizing process in order to integrate emotional activation in narratives.

40553228,Postoperative outcomes in mitochondrial myopathy-associated ptosis: a case series.,"To determine the anatomical and functional success and complication rates after surgical treatment in cases of mitochondrial myopathy (MM) with ptosis and how the complications that develop may be managed. Patients who underwent surgical correction due to ptosis between October 2010 and January 2020 and diagnosed with MM on muscle biopsy were retrospectively analyzed. The margin reflex distance 1 (MRD1) values of the patients were evaluated preoperatively, postoperative 1st week, 1st month, 6th month and 12th month. The complications that developed during the follow-ups and their management were examined. The study included 64 eyes of 34 patients. In all patients, the MRD1 value at 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months after the surgery showed a significant increase compared to the preoperative value (p < 0.05). Lagophthalmic keratitis developed in 1 eye (1.56%) that underwent levator resection and healed without sequelae. In 1 eye (1.56%) that underwent silicone frontal sling, lagophthalmic keratitis and inferior corneal ulcer developed, healed with minimal corneal haze and did not affect visual acuity. A corneal ulcer developed in 1 eye (1.56%) that underwent levator resection 12 months later due to insufficient lubricant treatment and healed with minimal corneal haze without causing vision loss with frequent topical lubricant and topical antibiotics. One of the two patients who underwent levator resection had ptosis progression in one eye after 18 months and the other in one eye after 24 months. Surgical revision was not required.

40553207,Depression after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: development of a screening tool and discharge user interface.,"A method for identification of chronic depression after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), risk stratification, and counseling is needed. This study aimed to develop a scoring system for post-aSAH depression and a user interface to supplement discharge counseling for patients. Based on a published prediction model for posttreatment depression risk among aSAH patients, a scale was developed using the beta coefficients of the final predictive model. The 5-point scale was based on 4 characteristics: tobacco use (2 points), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1 point), diabetes (1 point), and nonsaccular aneurysm type (1 point). A score of 1 was defined as low risk, a score of 2 or 3 was defined as medium risk, and a score of 4 or 5 was defined as high risk. The scale was then validated in a cohort of 514 patients treated at a single center. An interactive application was developed. The rate of posttreatment depression among aSAH patients was 29.6% (152 of 514). The low-risk group had a nonsignificant increase in depression risk (relative risk [RR] [95% CI] = 0.89 [0.59-1.33], p = 0.71) compared with those with a score of 0. Significant increases in depression risk were found in the medium-risk (RR [95% CI] = 1.78 [1.34-2.37], p < 0.001) and high-risk (RR [95% CI] = 2.29 [1.28-4.09], p < 0.001) groups.

40553205,Comprehensive predictive modeling in subarachnoid hemorrhage: integrating radiomics and clinical variables.,"Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a severe condition with high morbidity and long-term neurological consequences. Radiomics, by extracting quantitative features from Computed Tomograhpy (CT) scans, may reveal imaging biomarkers predictive of outcomes. This study evaluates the predictive value of radiomics in SAH for multiple outcomes and compares its performance to models based on clinical data.Radiomic features were extracted from admission CTs using segmentations of brain tissue (white and gray matter) and hemorrhage. Machine learning models with cross-validation were trained using clinical data, radiomics, or both, to predict 6-month mortality, Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), vasospasm, and long-term hydrocephalus. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was used to interpret feature contributions.The training dataset included 403 aneurysmal SAH patients; GOS predictions used all patients, while vasospasm and hydrocephalus predictions excluded those with incomplete data or early death, leaving 328 and 332 patients, respectively. Radiomics and clinical models demonstrated comparable performance, achieving in validation set AUCs more than 85% for six-month mortality and clinical outcome, and 75% and 86% for vasospasm and hydrocephalus, respectively. In an independent cohort of 41 patients, the combined models yielded AUCs of 89% for mortality, 87% for clinical outcome, 66% for vasospasm, and 72% for hydrocephalus. SHAP analysis highlighted significant contributions of radiomic features from brain tissue and hemorrhage segmentation, alongside key clinical variables, in predicting SAH outcomes.This study underscores the potential of radiomics-based approaches for SAH outcome prediction, demonstrating predictive power comparable to traditional clinical models and enhancing understanding of SAH-related complications.Clinical trial number Not applicable.",Neurosurgical review,2025.0,Gemma Urbanos; Ana M Castaño-León; Mónica Maldonado-Luna; Elena Salvador; Ana Ramos; Carmen Lechuga; César Sanz; Eduardo Juárez; Alfonso Lagares,subarachnoid hemorrhage sah severe condition high morbidity long term neurological consequence radiomic extract quantitative feature computed tomograhpy ct scan reveal imaging biomarker predictive outcome study evaluate predictive value radiomic sah multiple outcome compare performance model base clinical datum radiomic feature extract admission ct segmentation brain tissue white gray matter hemorrhage machine learning model cross validation train clinical datum radiomic predict 6 month mortality glasgow outcome scale gos vasospasm long term hydrocephalus shapley additive explanation shap analysis interpret feature contribution training dataset include 403 aneurysmal sah patient gos prediction patient vasospasm hydrocephalus prediction exclude incomplete datum early death leave 328 332 patient respectively radiomic clinical model demonstrate comparable performance achieve validation set aucs 85 month mortality clinical outcome 75 86 vasospasm hydrocephalus respectively independent cohort 41 patient combine model yield auc 89 mortality 87 clinical outcome 66 vasospasm 72 hydrocephalus shap analysis highlight significant contribution radiomic feature brain tissue hemorrhage segmentation alongside key clinical variable predict sah outcome study underscore potential radiomic base approach sah outcome prediction demonstrate predictive power comparable traditional clinical model enhance understanding sah relate complication clinical trial number applicable
40553197,Unveiling mysteries of aging: the potential of melatonin in preventing neurodegenerative diseases in older adults.,"Neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, result in a substantial health problem for the elderly, marked by ongoing neuronal degeneration and a deterioration in mental faculties. These disorders are frequently linked to oxidative stress, problems with mitochondria, and persistent inflammation in the brain, which worsen neuronal damage. The neurohormone melatonin, primarily secreted by the pineal gland, has gained recognition as a promising therapeutic agent due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. Melatonin's functions extend beyond its regulation of circadian rhythms, as research has demonstrated its ability to remove free radicals, improve mitochondrial performance, and adjust immune system responses, ultimately reducing the progression of neurodegenerative disease. Research findings from preclinical and clinical trials imply that taking melatonin supplements could lead to improved cognitive abilities, slower disease progression, and an overall better quality of life for elderly individuals suffering from neurodegenerative conditions. The mechanisms through which melatonin acts, the best dosage, and its long-term effectiveness are still being researched.

A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science, without language restrictions. Observational studies evaluating the association between sleep bruxism and OHRQoL in children (aged 0-12 years) were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Analytical Cross-Sectional Studies. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models. Studies not eligible for meta-analysis were described narratively. Eight studies were included in the systematic review, and four in the meta-analysis, encompassing data from 968 children. Meta-analysis demonstrated that sleep bruxism was significantly associated with impaired OHRQoL (OR = 1.99; 95% CI: 1.09-3.65), with greater impacts observed in the symptom (MD = 0.43; 95% CI: 0.17-0.69) and functional domains (MD = 1.00; 95% CI: 0.08-1.92). No significant association was observed for family-related outcomes (OR = 1.87; 95% CI: 0.60-5.82). Among studies not included in the meta-analysis, findings were inconsistent, highlighting methodological variability. Sleep bruxism adversely affects children's OHRQoL, especially in domains related to symptoms and functional limitations.

40553176,Quantitative cervical cord MRI in spinal muscular atrophy: a sensitive imaging biomarker of disease evolution and treatment.,"Nusinersen is an approved disease-modifying therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a rare neuromuscular disease characterized by degeneration of alpha motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord (SC), leading to progressive muscle atrophy and weakness. This exploratory study investigated the potential of quantitative SC magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a biomarker for monitoring treatment-related changes in pediatric and adult SMA patients treated with nusinersen at different disease stages. Five pediatric and three adult SMA patients underwent clinical assessments, including the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) and Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), along with SC MRI at multiple time points (TPs) during nusinersen treatment. At each TP, total cross-sectional area (TCA), grey matter area (GM<sub>area</sub>), and magnetization transfer saturation (MT<sub>sat</sub>) were measured at multiple cervical SC levels. All pediatric patients showed a progressive increase in SC TCA and GM<sub>area</sub> over time, paralleled by improvements in HFMSE and RULM scores. In contrast, adult patients exhibited stable SC MRI measures with modest functional gains. MT<sub>sat</sub> values remained largely stable across time points, with a mild decrease observed at TP5. TCA and GM<sub>area</sub> showed positive association trends with clinical scales. Nusinersen showed beneficial effects in both adult and pediatric SMA patients, with more marked improvements in children.

40553164,Effect of lemborexant on sleep-wake state discrepancy in participants with insomnia disorder.,"The efficacy of hypnotic drugs for sleep-wake state discrepancy remains unclear. This study evaluated the efficacy of lemborexant in improving sleep-wake state discrepancy in insomnia disorder and its associations with sleep quality and daytime functioning. Twenty-nine participants diagnosed with insomnia disorder were treated with lemborexant for 12 weeks. Objective sleep parameters were measured using a home electroencephalography device, and subjective parameters were obtained from electronic sleep diaries. Sleep-wake state discrepancy indices, including discrepancies of sleep onset latency (disSOL), wake after sleep onset (disWASO), total sleep time (disTST), and sleep efficiency (disSE), were calculated as objective minus subjective sleep parameters. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were used to assess sleep quality and daytime sleepiness. Linear mixed-effects models were used for data analysis. Both subjective and objective sleep parameters were improved at 12 weeks after lemborexant administration. The disTST decreased significantly at 4 and 12 weeks. The disSOL increased and disSE decreased significantly by 12 weeks. Participants with defined sleep-wake state discrepancy (disTST > 0 min) showed greater decreases in these indices, whereas minimal changes were observed in those without. The disWASO did not change significantly among baseline and 4 and 12 weeks. The improvement in disTST demonstrated a significant association with the reduction of ESS scores (p = 0.008), whereas there was no substantial effect on PSQI scores. The present findings suggest that lemborexant treatment reduces sleep-wake state discrepancy, which may be associated with improved daytime functioning in patients with insomnia disorder.",Psychopharmacology,2025.0,Kent Naito; Kunihiro Iwamoto; Seiko Miyata; Ippei Okada; Keita Kawai; Akihiro Fujimoto; Yuki Kogo; Daisuke Mori; Nao Matsuyama; Masahiko Ando; Norio Ozaki; Masashi Ikeda,efficacy hypnotic drug sleep wake state discrepancy remain unclear study evaluate efficacy lemborexant improve sleep wake state discrepancy insomnia disorder association sleep quality daytime functioning participant diagnose insomnia disorder treat lemborexant 12 week objective sleep parameter measure home electroencephalography device subjective parameter obtain electronic sleep diary sleep wake state discrepancy index include discrepancy sleep onset latency dissol wake sleep onset diswaso total sleep time distst sleep efficiency disse calculate objective minus subjective sleep parameter pittsburgh sleep quality index psqi epworth sleepiness scale ess assess sleep quality daytime sleepiness linear mixed effect model datum analysis subjective objective sleep parameter improve 12 week lemborexant administration distst decrease significantly 4 12 week dissol increase disse decrease significantly 12 week participant define sleep wake state discrepancy distst > 0 min show great decrease index minimal change observe diswaso change significantly baseline 4 12 week improvement distst demonstrate significant association reduction ess score p = 0.008 substantial effect psqi score present finding suggest lemborexant treatment reduce sleep wake state discrepancy associate improved daytime function patient insomnia disorder

40553109,Matrix metalloproteinase-triggered self-assembling peptides for biomedical applications.,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play critical roles in numerous physiological processes and are essential for various fundamental biological activities. Alterations in their expression levels have been associated with multiple diseases and pathological conditions. The self-assembly of small-molecule peptides into hydrogels and nanomaterials has been widely investigated for its various biomedical applications. MMPs can trigger enzyme-instructed assemblies of peptides with specific sequences to form various hydrogels for potential applications in treating several diseases, including cancer, inflammation, wound healing, myocardial infarction, and central nervous system disease, and in tissue engineering. In addition, MMPs can also trigger the self-assembly of peptides into a variety of nanostructures tailored on demand, especially serving as indicators and activators to increase their functionality in sensing applications and controlled substance release, acting as primitive biological triggers, modulating biological responses, ensuring the targeted delivery of biomolecules to specific locations, and inducing changes in the self-assembled peptide nanostructures by introducing enzyme cleavage site recognition sequences to release loaded drugs, which is crucial for applications in hydrogels and nanomaterials. This review summarizes and highlights the successful applications of various MMP-triggered self-assembled peptide hydrogels and nanostructures over the past decade and emphasizes their potential for controlled drug delivery, targeted therapy, and intelligent biomaterial-assisted wound regeneration and healing.

40553100,Language comprehension assessment using the computer-based instrument for low motor language testing (C-BiLLT) in children with Angelman syndrome.,"Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder with intellectual disability, limited to no speech development, epilepsy, motor deficits, and behavioral issues. Children with AS generally demonstrate better language comprehension than expressive language skills, but language comprehension is difficult to measure since commonly used tests rely on fine motor skills and/or require a certain level of intellectual functioning. The Computer-Based instrument for Low motor Language Testing (C-BiLLT) was developed to assess language comprehension in non-speaking children with motor impairments. This study assessed the feasibility, construct validity and sensitivity of the C-BiLLT in a clinical cohort of 65 children with AS (2 to 19 years old). All participants successfully finished the test, without floor or ceiling effects. The C-BiLLT showed good construct validity, reflected by a significant correlation with the Bayley language comprehension subscale and with related constructs (expressive language measured by the Communication Matrix and the Bayley cognition subscale). C-BiLLT scores were associated with age. Finally, the C-BiLLT was sensitive to differentiate between AS genotypes. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the C-BiLLT is a feasible, valid and sensitive measurement instrument for language comprehension in children with AS. We recommend using the C-BiLLT in clinical practice and in scientific research.","Augmentative and alternative communication (Baltimore, Md. : 1985)",2025.0,Cindy Navis; Doesjka A Hagenaar; Karen G C B Bindels-de Heus; Marc P van der Schroeff; Johanna J M Geytenbeek; Marie-Claire Y de Wit,angelman syndrome rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder intellectual disability limit speech development epilepsy motor deficit behavioral issue child generally demonstrate well language comprehension expressive language skill language comprehension difficult measure commonly test rely fine motor skill and/or require certain level intellectual functioning computer base instrument low motor language testing c billt develop assess language comprehension non speak child motor impairment study assess feasibility construct validity sensitivity c billt clinical cohort 65 child 2 19 year old participant successfully finish test floor ceiling effect c billt show good construct validity reflect significant correlation bayley language comprehension subscale related construct expressive language measure communication matrix bayley cognition subscale c billt score associate age finally c billt sensitive differentiate genotype conclusion demonstrate c billt feasible valid sensitive measurement instrument language comprehension child recommend c billt clinical practice scientific research

To assess the presence of antineurofascin antibodies (ANFA) 155, 186, and 140 in patients with MS. In this multicenter prospective study, we investigated the presence of antibodies targeting NF155, NF186, and NF140 in Indian MS patients satisfying McDonald's 2017 criteria. ANFA was measured by competitive ELISA technique using human neurofascins. During the 11-month period from November 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024, we tested 71 MS patients for ANFA. Of the 71 MS patients, 57 (80.28%) tested positive for at least one antineurofascin antibody and 15 (21.13%) were positive for two antibodies. Isolated ANFA140 was present in 26 (36.62%) patients, isolated ANFA186 in 13 (18.31%), and isolated ANFA155 in 3 (4.23%). Combined ANFA 186/140 was present in 14 (19.72%) patients and combined ANFA 155/140 in 1 (1.41%).

To identify predictive biomarkers, we conducted a prospective observational study involving 110 GBS patients. We focused on assessing the levels of two proteins associated with neurogeneration, namely CNTF (ciliary neurotrophic factor) and TIMP1 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1), in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of GBS patients. Measurements were taken prior to and following the second week of illness. We found that the increase in CNTF and TIMP1, as determined by the ratio of post-2nd week CNTF levels to pre-2nd week CNTF levels, exhibited a positive correlation with improvements in the Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score at both 4 weeks and 6 months. Based on these findings, we conclude that both CNTF and TIMP1 can serve as valuable prognostic biomarkers in GBS.",Neurology India,2025.0,Sridhar Amalakanti; Kesava V R Arepalli; Jyothi P Jillella,guillain barré syndrome gbs acute neuropathy characterize vary prognosis identify predictive biomarker conduct prospective observational study involve 110 gbs patient focus assess level protein associate neurogeneration cntf ciliary neurotrophic factor timp1 tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase 1 cerebrospinal fluid csf gbs patient measurement take prior follow second week illness find increase cntf timp1 determine ratio post-2nd week cntf level pre-2nd week cntf level exhibit positive correlation improvement medical research council mrc sum score 4 week 6 month base finding conclude cntf timp1 serve valuable prognostic biomarker gbs
40553061,Isolated Abducens Nerve Palsies from COVID-19 Infections: Clinical Features and Outcomes.,"Isolated abducens nerve palsies from COVID-19 infections are rarely described in literature. Their clinical features are poorly understood, and guidance on their treatment is lacking. To describe the clinical features of isolated abducens nerve palsies from COVID-19 infection, and provide guidance on their management. We performed a literature review and analyzed the clinical features of patients with isolated abducens nerve palsy from COVID-19 infections reported in literature. In total, 16 cases from 15 studies published between January 2020 and December 2023 were identified. Their median age was 44 years (range 3-71, including two children). Nearly two-thirds (10/16, 63%) were without medical history. Abducens nerve palsies mostly occurred early with COVID-19 symptoms (median of 5.5 days, range 0-21 days). They were all unilateral, and displayed neither clear gender nor left-right predilections. Brain magnetic resonance imaging scans were often unremarkable (9/13, 69%). More than half (9/16, 56%) received no treatment or symptomatic treatment only, while only two received steroids. Regardless, nearly all experienced clinical of diplopia (14/16, 88%), of which most recovery were either complete or near-complete (at least 10/14, 71%) within a median period of 26 days (range 5-240 days). Isolated abducens nerve palsies are early but uncommon complications of COVID-19, mainly affecting patients with mild infections. Prognosis appears fair even when without corticosteroid treatment, and recovery is significant and early in most. Observation and early outpatient clinical review within a month are reasonable measures.

40553056,A transdiagnostic examination of sex- and race and ethnicity-based mental health treatment disparities among publicly insured youth.,"Low-income, publicly insured youth face numerous barriers to adequate mental health care, which may be compounded for those with multiple marginalized identities. However, no research has examined how identity and diagnosis may interact to shape the treatment experiences of under-resourced youth with psychiatric conditions. Applying an intersectional lens to treatment disparities is essential for developing targeted interventions to promote equitable care. Analyses included youth ages 7-18 with eating disorders (EDs; <i>n</i> = 3,311), mood/anxiety disorders (<i>n</i> = 3,219), or psychotic disorders (<i>n</i> = 3,035) enrolled in California Medicaid. Using state billing records, we examined sex- and race and ethnicity-based disparities in receipt of core services - outpatient therapy, outpatient medical care, and inpatient treatment - in the first year after diagnosis and potential differences across diagnostic groups. Many youth (50.7% across diagnoses) received no outpatient therapy, and youth with EDs were least likely to receive these services. Youth of color received fewer days of outpatient therapy than White youth, and Latinx youth received fewer therapy and medical services across outpatient and inpatient contexts. Sex- and race and ethnicity-based disparities were especially pronounced for youth with EDs, with particularly low levels of service receipt among boys and Latinx youth with EDs. Results raise concerns for unmet treatment needs among publicly insured youth, which are exacerbated for youth with multiple marginalized identities and those who do not conform to historical stereotypes of affected individuals (e.g., low-income boys of color with EDs).

40553041,The causal effect of smoking on psychiatric disorders: an examination of brain volume as a potential pathway.,"There is growing evidence that smoking increases the risk of developing psychiatric disorders, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. We examine brain structure as a potential pathway between smoking and psychiatric disease liability. We test associations between smoking (initiation, cigarettes per day, cessation, lifetime use) and depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, with and without correcting for volume of the amygdala, hippocampus, lateral and medial orbitofrontal cortex, superior frontal context, and cortical thickness and surface area. We use three methods that use summary statistics of genome-wide association studies to investigate genome-wide and local genetic overlap (genomic structural equation modeling, local analysis of (co)variant association), as well as causal associations (Mendelian randomization). While we find causal effects of smoking on brain volume in different brain areas, and with psychiatric disorders, brain volume did not seem to mediate the effect of smoking on psychiatric disorders. While these findings are limited by characteristics of the included summary statistics (e.g. sample size), we conclude that brain volume of these areas is unlikely to explain a substantial part of any effect of smoking on psychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, genetic methods are valuable tools for exploring other potential mechanisms, such as brain functional connectivity, foregoing the need to collect all phenotypes in one dataset.",Psychological medicine,2025.0,Margot P van de Weijer; Shu Liu; Anaïs B Thijssen; Robyn E Wootton; Adrià Túnez; Jentien M Vermeulen; Guido van Wingen; Dirk J A Smit; Marcus Munafò; Karin J H Verweij; Jorien L Treur,grow evidence smoking increase risk develop psychiatric disorder underlie mechanism largely unknown examine brain structure potential pathway smoking psychiatric disease liability test association smoking initiation cigarette day cessation lifetime use depression bipolar disorder schizophrenia correct volume amygdala hippocampus lateral medial orbitofrontal cortex superior frontal context cortical thickness surface area use method use summary statistic genome wide association study investigate genome wide local genetic overlap genomic structural equation modeling local analysis co)variant association causal association mendelian randomization find causal effect smoking brain volume different brain area psychiatric disorder brain volume mediate effect smoke psychiatric disorder finding limit characteristic include summary statistic e.g. sample size conclude brain volume area unlikely explain substantial effect smoke psychiatric disorder genetic method valuable tool explore potential mechanism brain functional connectivity forego need collect phenotype dataset
40553012,Prenatal Antiretroviral Exposure and Concomitant Neurodevelopmental Problems among 5-year-old Children who are HIV-Exposed and Uninfected.,"Atazanavir (ATV) has been a preferred protease inhibitor prescribed to pregnant women with HIV, often given with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine. Studies have reported associations of prenatal exposure to ATV with early neurodevelopmental problems among children HIV-exposed but uninfected (CHEU). Prospective US-based multisite cohort study of CHEU. Monolingual English-speaking CHEU from the Surveillance Monitoring for ART Toxicities study were evaluated for cognition, language and behavior at age 5 years. Exploratory factor analyses using ten composite scores were performed to estimate underlying factors reflecting covariation of these domains. Mean differences of standardized factor scores were compared between CHEU exposed to TDF/emtricitabine with/without ATV versus zidovudine/lamivudine without ATV using linear generalized estimating equations, adjusting for confounders and accounting for clustering by site. Separate analyses were conducted by timing of maternal ART initiation (pre-conception versus post-conception). 585 CHEU were exposed to TDF/emtricitabine with/without ATV, or zidovudine/lamivudine without ATV, and had valid composite scores. Two factors were identified, explaining 27-88% variability of individual composite scores. Factor 1 contributed to cognitive and language domains; Factor 2 contributed to the behavioral domain. Differences in factor scores among ART exposure groups were not observed for cognition/language, but CHEU exposed to TDF/emtricitabine with/without ATV had worse behavioral functioning factor scores compared to zidovudine/lamivudine without ATV in the post-conception strata, especially for those exposed to TDF/emtricitabine/ATV when ARVs were initiated in trimester 1.

40552999,A Data-Centric Approach to Deep Learning for Brain Metastasis Analysis at MRI.,"Background With the increasing incidence of brain metastases (BMs), artificial intelligence models have shown promise in assisting with the detection and volumetric analysis of lesions at MRI. However, current models are limited in identifying small lesions and lack generalizability. Purpose To develop a generalizable deep learning system for detecting, segmenting, and longitudinally tracking BMs of any size at MRI. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, a data-centric approach to deep learning model development was used. A multicenter dataset was collected, comprising pre- and/or posttreatment MRI scans from patients with BMs and MRI scans from patients with cancer without BMs (December 2015 to August 2023). Iterative data annotation by radiologists with systematic quality control increased the consistency of reference segmentations. A modified nnU-Net framework, with robust data preprocessing and augmentation, was used. Lesion-wise detection metrics and segmentation performance, Dice similarity coefficient, and normalized surface distance were evaluated. Results In total, 1985 scans from 1623 patients (mean age, 62.0 years ± 12.2 [SD]; 743 female patients, 157 patients of unknown sex), with 5552 BMs, were included. BMs were present in 64.8% of the scans (1286 of 1985), 36.0% (463 of 1286) of which were posttreatment scans. The model was trained on 1451 scans acquired on 30 different scanners. In internal testing (<i>n</i> = 223), sensitivity was 98.0% (95% CI: 96.3, 99.0; 449 of 458 lesions). In external testing (<i>n</i> = 311), sensitivity was 97.4% (95% CI: 96.2, 98.2; 935 of 960; <i>P</i> = .58), with a mean of 0.6 false positives per patient. The sensitivity remained high for all lesion sizes, including those less than 3 mm in diameter (93.3% [95% CI: 89.1, 96.0]; 196 of 210). Median Dice similarity coefficient was 0.89 and 0.90 for the internal and external test datasets, respectively (<i>P</i> = .13). Median normalized surface distance was 0.99 for both datasets. Conclusion The deep learning system demonstrated high performance and generalizability in detecting and segmenting BMs of all sizes on pre- and posttreatment MRI scans. © RSNA, 2025 <i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i>",Radiology,2025.0,Laurens Topff; Liliana Petrychenko; Neeraj Jain; Sara Lingier; Jeroen Bertels; Patricio Astudillo; Milan Prosec; Pablo Menéndez Fernández-Miranda; Olivier Gevaert; Marion Smits; Sophie Derks; Eline Verhaak; Patrick E J Hanssens; Enrique Marco de Lucas; Rodrigo Sutil; Pablo D Dominguez; Adina Negoita; Ernst Visser; David Corral Fontecha; Loes M M Braun; Dieta Brandsma; Jacob J Visser; Erik R Ranschaert; Kevin B W Groot Lipman; Regina G H Beets-Tan,background increase incidence brain metastasis bms artificial intelligence model show promise assist detection volumetric analysis lesion mri current model limit identify small lesion lack generalizability purpose develop generalizable deep learning system detecting segment longitudinally track bms size mri material methods retrospective study data centric approach deep learning model development multicenter dataset collect comprise pre- and/or posttreatment mri scan patient bms mri scan patient cancer bms december 2015 august 2023 iterative data annotation radiologist systematic quality control increase consistency reference segmentation modify nnu net framework robust datum preprocessing augmentation lesion wise detection metric segmentation performance dice similarity coefficient normalize surface distance evaluate result total 1985 scan 1623 patient mean age 62.0 year ± 12.2 sd 743 female patient 157 patient unknown sex 5552 bms include bm present 64.8 scan 1286 1985 36.0 463 1286 posttreatment scan model train 1451 scan acquire 30 different scanner internal testing < > n</i > = 223 sensitivity 98.0 95 ci 96.3 99.0 449 458 lesion external testing < > n</i > = 311 sensitivity 97.4 95 ci 96.2 98.2 935 960 < > p</i > = .58 mean 0.6 false positive patient sensitivity remain high lesion size include 3 mm diameter 93.3 95 ci 89.1 96.0 196 210 median dice similarity coefficient 0.89 0.90 internal external test dataset respectively < > p</i > = .13 median normalize surface distance 0.99 dataset conclusion deep learning system demonstrate high performance generalizability detect segment bms size pre- posttreatment mri scan © rsna 2025 < > supplemental material available article.</i >
40552996,Modulation of Cortical and Hippocampal Functional MRI Connectivity Following Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation in Mild Alzheimer Disease.,"Background Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) may be effective for improving cognitive function in Alzheimer disease (AD), but its impact on brain functional connectivity (FC) has not been well studied. Purpose To evaluate tACS efficacy in improving cognitive performance and modulating FC between brain regions in individuals with AD using functional MRI. Materials and Methods In this prospective randomized controlled trial (September 2020 to April 2022), participants with mild AD were assigned to active (40 Hz tACS with 15-mA intensity) or sham (no γ frequency or current) tACS groups for 3 weeks (referred to as week 3), with a 3-month follow-up (referred to as month 3). Functional MRI and cognitive testing were performed at baseline, week 3, and month 3. Primary outcomes were changes in Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores from baseline to week 3. Secondary outcomes included FC changes within multiple cortical networks and between cortex and hippocampus from baseline to week 3 and month 3, assessed using Fisher <i>z</i>-transformed correlation coefficient (hereafter, <i>z</i> score). Results Forty-six participants were randomized into the active group (<i>n</i> = 23; median age, 66 years; IQR, 62-69 years; 16 female participants) or the sham group (<i>n</i> = 23; mean age, 64 years; IQR, 61-69 years; 14 female participants). The active group had higher Mini-Mental State Examination (median score change, 2 [IQR, 1-5] vs 0 [IQR, -1 to 2]; <i>P</i> = .001) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (median score change, 2 [IQR, 0-4] vs 0 [IQR, -1 to 2]; <i>P</i> = .03) scores than the sham group at week 3, respectively. Compared with the sham group, the active group had increased FC between left hippocampus and left middle cingulate gyrus (<i>z</i> score difference, 0.29; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.42; false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted <i>P</i> < .001) and between the left hippocampus and the left middle frontal gyrus (<i>z</i> score difference, 0.16; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.29; FDR-adjusted <i>P</i> = .04) within the posterior default-mode network (<i>z</i> score difference, 0.40; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.73; FDR-adjusted <i>P</i> = .046) and within the visual network (<i>z</i> score difference, 0.45; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.73; FDR-adjusted <i>P</i> = .007) from baseline to week 3. Conclusion Cognitive performance in mild AD improved following tACS, with increased FC within cortical networks and between the hippocampus and specific cortical regions.
