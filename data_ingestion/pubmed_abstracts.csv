40568761,Evaluation of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Dopaminergic Neurons from Siblings with Gaucher Disease Discordant for Parkinsonism.,"In Gaucher disease (GD), glucocerebrosidase (GCase) deficiency results from biallelic pathogenic GBA1 variants. While GBA1 variants are a major risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), most patients with GD never develop parkinsonism. To understand factors impacting PD penetrance in patients with GD by comparing induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived dopaminergic neurons (DANs) from GD siblings discordant for PD. iPSCs, reprogrammed from two different sibling pairs where both siblings had GD but only one developed PD, were differentiated into DANs. In one family, DAN enrichment was achieved via geneticin selection and proteomic evaluations were performed. GCase and lipid substrate levels were similar in GD and GD/PD DANs. After geneticin selection, proteomic analysis of the enriched DANs showed upregulation of molecular chaperones in the GD/PD line. PD discordance in both sets of GD siblings did not correlate with GCase or lipid substrate levels in DANs, implicating the involvement of other modifiers. Published 2025.

40568753,Translational minimal physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for transferrin receptor-mediated brain delivery of antibodies.,"Successful development of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for the treatment of central nervous system disorders has been challenging due to their minimal ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), resulting in poor brain exposure. Bispecific antibodies (bsAb) that bind to transmembrane protein expressed at the BBB, such as the transferrin receptor (TfR), have shown enhanced brain exposure in rodents and non-human primate (NHP) due to receptor-mediated transcytosis. However, it remains unclear how preclinical findings translate to humans. Moreover, optimal TfR binding affinity remains a subject of debate. Model-informed drug discovery and development is a powerful approach that has been successfully used to support research and development. The goal of this analysis was to expand a published brain minimal physiologically based pharmacokinetic (mPBPK) model to investigate the optimal TfR binding affinity for maximal brain delivery in NHP and to facilitate prediction of the PK of anti-TfR bsAbs in humans from NHP data. Literature data for plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain exposure after administration of non-TfR mAbs and monovalent bsAbs with respect to TfR in NHP were used to develop the TfR mPBPK model. Clinical validation using human PK data from plasma and CSF for the monovalent anti-TfR bsAb trontinemab demonstrated good predictive performance without major model recalibration. The availability of the TfR mPBPK model is envisaged to provide better understanding of the relationship between TfR binding affinity, dose, and brain exposure, which would lead to more robust selection of lead candidates and efficacious dosing regimens.",mAbs,2025,Morris Muliaditan; Tamara J van Steeg; Lindsay B Avery; Wei Sun; Timothy R Hammond; Diana Hijdra; Siak-Leng Choi; Nikhil Pillai; Nina C Leksa; Panteleimon D Mavroudis
40568737,Male and Female Healthcare Trajectories in Autism: Are There Any Differences Considering Age at Diagnosis and Intellectual or Developmental Disabilities Status?,"The aim of this study was to compare the healthcare trajectories (HCTs) 2 years after a first diagnosis of autism according to sex, age at diagnosis, and intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDD) status. This is a retrospective cohort study using health administrative data from Québec, Canada. The cohort included all individuals with a first diagnosis of autism registered by a physician between April 2012 and March 2015. HCTs were stratified by sex, presence of IDD, and age at diagnosis (youth, adult), and analyzed using state sequence analysis across healthcare settings, providers, and reasons for use. Our cohort included 5289 individuals, 76.6% were male, and 26.3% were adults at the time of diagnosis. The healthcare use decreased slightly over time, though intensity was higher in females. Sex differences in HCTs were strongly influenced by IDD status and age at diagnosis. While no significant sex differences were observed in HCTs for individuals with IDD diagnosed with autism in adulthood, the psychiatric condition profiles showed notable differences between males and females. Hospital days nearly doubled for females diagnosed in childhood compared to males, while males with IDD diagnosed with autism in childhood and males without IDD diagnosed in adulthood had fewer physical illness visits. Although physical and mental health challenges appear largely managed in ambulatory care during youth, high hospitalization rates in those diagnosed in adulthood, particularly females and those with IDD, highlight concerns about continuity of care and avoidable hospitalizations for these subgroups of patients.",Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,2025,Mélanie Couture; Josiane Courteau; Sébastien Brodeur; Yohann M Chiu; Mireille Courteau; Émilie Dubé; Nina Thomas; Éric Fombonne; Isabelle Dufour
40568709,Neurodevelopmental disorders and gut-brain interactions: exploring the therapeutic potential of pycnogenol through microbial-metabolic-neural networks.,"Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), characterized by cognitive impairments and behavioral abnormalities, represent a clinically diverse group of conditions typically emerging during childhood or adolescence. Major subtypes encompass autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and epilepsy. The pathogenesis of these disorders involves multifactorial interactions between genetic susceptibility (<i>Shank3</i> mutations in ASD), environmental triggers (prenatal toxins), neurotransmitter dysregulation (dopamine (GA) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) systems) and immune dysregulation. Growing research highlights the gut-brain axis disruption as a potential contributor to NDDs pathophysiology, though systematic evaluation of therapeutic approaches targeting this axis and related gastrointestinal comorbidities (GIDs) remains limited. This review comprehensively examines the pathological mechanisms underlying ADHD, ASD, and epilepsy, while analyzing the reciprocal relationship between gut-brain axis dysregulation and GID manifestations in NDDs. Notably, abnormal activation of key signaling pathways including NF-κB, MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR is strongly associated with the pathogenesis of NDDs. We further propose pycnogenol (PYC), a polyphenol extract of pine bark, as a natural compound with multiple bioactivities such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, can directly or indirectly affect the function of the gut-brain axis by regulating the structure of the intestinal microbial community (increasing the abundance of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> and butyric acid-producing bacteria) and its metabolites, providing a new strategy for the treatment of NDDs.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2025,Ling Chen; Zhiqiang Li; Yuying Fan
40568592,"PANoptosis in neurological disorders: mechanisms, implications, and therapeutic potential.","PANoptosis is a unique form of programmed cell death (PCD) that has the combined main features of pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, but cannot be fully explained by any single pathway alone. Among all the influencing factors in PANoptosis, the activation and assembly of PANoptosomes are the most critical. To date, four distinct PANoptosomes have been identified: Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), and nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat-containing receptor 12 (NLRP12) PANoptosomes. Currently, PANoptosis is a promising target for central nervous system (CNS) disorders treatment. Understanding its mechanisms will facilitate its therapeutic application. This review introduces the concept of PANoptosis, its detection methods, the molecular composition and regulation of PANoptosomes, and the role of ninjurin 1 (NINJ1), a new ""executor"" in PANoptosis. In addition, recent therapeutic advances targeting PANoptosis in CNS diseases were also discussed. Future research on inhibiting PANoptosis, the dynamic regulatory relationships among three death pathways, and the interactions with NINJ1 will offer new clinical insights.",Frontiers in immunology,2025,Jingyi Li; Yi Qu
40568579,Alterations in peripheral blood immune cell profiles of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder across different phases and after B cell depletion therapy.,"Peripheral blood immune cell profiles of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) are still unclear under different disease states and after B cell depletion therapy. Moreover, NMOSD is often confused with multiple sclerosis (MS) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease (MOGAD). The study aims to illustrate peripheral blood immune cell profiles of NMOSD under different disease states, after B cell depletion therapy, and compared with MS and MOGAD. This study included 76 NMOSD patients, 20 MS patients, and 12 MOGAD patients in the acute phase, along with 37 controls whose sex and age were matched with NMOSD patients. Forty-two of 76 patients with acute NMOSD were followed in remission, of whom 13, 15, and 11 patients received rituximab treatment, inebilizumab treatment, or conventional immunosuppressive therapies alone, respectively. The levels of diverse peripheral blood immune cells were measured by blood routine examination and flow cytometry. Distinctions among groups were analyzed using statistical methods. Compared with controls and NMOSD patients in remission, there was an elevation in the levels of neutrophils, platelets, platelet/lymphocyte ratio, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and systemic inflammation index in acute NMOSD patients, while a decline was observed in the levels of lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, CD3+ T cells, CD3+CD4+ T cells, and CD4/CD8 ratio. NMOSD had increased levels of platelets and platelet/lymphocyte ratio, and decreased levels of eosinophils, basophils, CD4/CD8 ratio, and CD3+CD4+ T cells compared with MS. NMOSD had decreased levels of eosinophils, basophils, and CD19+ B cells, along with elevated platelet/lymphocyte ratio compared with MOGAD. After rituximab treatment, not only did CD19+ B cell level decrease, but eosinophil counts also increased. After inebilizumab treatment, not only did CD19+ B cell level decrease, but also the ratios of CD3+ T cells and CD3+CD8+ T cells increased. The quantity and ratios of eosinophils in rituximab group surpassed those in inebilizumab group. Peripheral blood immune cell profiles of acute NMOSD patients showed widespread distinctions compared to those of remission NMOSD patients, acute MS patients, acute MOGAD patients, and controls, as well as after differential therapies. Our findings provide clues to comprehensively understand the abnormality of the dynamic and integrated immune network in NMOSD, distinguish NMOSD from MS and MOGAD, and search for more effective and safe therapeutic targets.",Frontiers in immunology,2025,Xuying Wang; Ruoyi Guo; Zhichao Yao; Lu Liu; Zhen Jia; Xiujuan Song; Bin Li
40568566,Associations between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and computed tomography-defined low muscle mass in older adults and sex-related differences.,"The associations between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and the risk of sarcopenia are inconclusive. This study aimed to investigate the association between HDL-C levels and chest computed tomography (CT)-defined low muscle mass in older adults and its sex-related differences. This prospective study involved 1995 participants aged ≥50 years. The muscle area of the bilateral erector spinae muscles was measured at the T12 level on a single CT image. Linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the effects of related factors on muscle area. Multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis were used to analyze the relationships between HDL-C quartile and low muscle mass in all participants and in the male and female subgroups. An increased HDL-C level was associated with a greater risk of lower muscle area overall (β=-1.91, 95% CI: -2.95 to -0.87) and in male participants (β=-3.16, 95% CI: -4.70- -1.61), whereas no significant difference was found in the female subgroup (<i>P</i> > 0.05). A higher continuous HDL-C level was associated with a greater risk of low muscle mass in all participants (odds ratio (OR) =2.28, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.51-3.45) and in the male subgroup (OR=3.28, 95% CI: 1.84-5.87) after adjustment for confounders, whereas no significant difference was found in the female subgroup (P>0.05). Furthermore, the RCS model showed similar results regarding the relationship between HDL-C levels and the risk of low muscle mass. Higher HDL-C levels were associated with a significantly greater risk of low muscle mass, particularly in older male adults. HDL-C levels are useful in identifying older individuals who are at risk for low muscle mass.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2025,Weixiao Zhang; Yongkang Liu; Yiping Zhang; Dingzhe Zhang; Jianhua Wang; Xiao Chen
40568416,Self- versus caregiver-reported apathy across neurological disorders.,"Apathy is a prevalent and persistent neuropsychiatric syndrome across many neurological disorders, significantly impacting both patients and caregivers. We systematically quantified discrepancies between self- and caregiver-reported apathy in 335 patients with a variety of diagnoses, such as frontotemporal dementia (behavioural variant and semantic dementia subtypes), Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, Alzheimer's disease dementia, mild cognitive impairment, small vessel cerebrovascular disease, subjective cognitive decline and autoimmune encephalitis. Using the Apathy Motivation Index (AMI) and its analogous caregiver version (AMI-CG), we found that caregiver-reported apathy consistently exceeded self-reported levels across all conditions. Moreover, self-reported apathy accounted for only 14.1% of the variance in caregiver ratings. This apathy reporting discrepancy was most pronounced in conditions associated with impaired insight, such as behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, and was significantly correlated with cognitive impairment. Deficits in memory and fluency explained an additional 11.2% of the variance in caregiver-reported apathy. Specifically, executive function deficits (e.g. indexed by fluency) and memory impairments may contribute to behavioural inertia or recall of it. These findings highlight the need to integrate patient and caregiver perspectives in apathy assessments, especially for conditions with prominent cognitive impairment. To improve diagnostic accuracy and deepen our understanding of apathy across neurological disorders, we highlight the need for adapted apathy assessment strategies that account for cognitive impairment particularly in individuals with insight or memory deficits. Understanding the cognitive mechanisms underpinning discordant apathy reporting in dementia might help inform targeted clinical interventions and reduce caregiver burden.",Brain communications,2025,Sijia Zhao; Anna Scholcz; Matthew A Rouse; Verena S Klar; Akke Ganse-Dumrath; Sofia Toniolo; M John Broulidakis; Matthew A Lambon Ralph; James B Rowe; Peter Garrard; Sian Thompson; Sarosh R Irani; Sanjay G Manohar; Masud Husain
40568414,Tailoring Treatment for Substance Use Disorders in Older Adults: A Mixed-methods Study.,"The number of persons in mid-to-late life with substance use disorders (SUDs) in the United States has tripled over the past 2 decades, with opioid use disorder largely accounting for this increase. Older individuals with SUDs have unique medical, psychological, and social needs. Despite these needs and growing demand for SUD treatment within this age group, little is known regarding availability of specialized SUD treatment programs for older persons and barriers or facilitators to implementing these services. We conducted a mixed-methods study, first conducting qualitative interviews with counselors at outpatient SUD treatment facilities in Connecticut (<i>N</i> = 10). We then used these qualitative interview findings to guide analysis of quantitative data from SAMHSA's National Substance Use and Mental Health Services Survey (N-SUMHSS) and the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) survey. Using the Behavioral Model of Health Services Utilization for Vulnerable Populations and Framework Analysis, we identified predisposing (eg, treatment attitudes), enabling (eg, transportation), need-based (eg, comorbidities; integrated care), and healthcare system-related (eg, insurance) characteristics affecting older adults' SUD treatment engagement. SUD treatment facilities offering ""a tailored program for seniors or older adults"" increased steadily in Connecticut, and the United States overall, between 2010 and 2022. Of the 74 (43%) Connecticut facilities offering tailored older adult services, social, structural, and mental health services were offered at high rates (64%-86%), but medical services were offered at lower rates (39%-52%). Our findings indicate a gap between the treatment needs of older adults with SUDs and available services. Greater attention to integrated medical services, screening for geriatric-specific syndromes that could impede treatment access (eg, cognitive impairment; mobility), and appropriate workforce training is needed to optimize treatment for older adults with SUD, especially considering the opioid use disorder epidemic in the United States.",Innovation in aging,2025,Megan O'Grady; Kristyn Zajac; Alexandra DePalma; Yang Liu; Lisa C Barry
40568361,Quantitative 3D reconstruction of viral vector distribution in rodent and ovine brain following local delivery.,"Viral vectors are an active area of research and development to treat diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). However, systemic delivery of large-molecular weight biologics is complicated by limited crossing of the blood-brain barrier, immunological clearance from the circulation, off-target effects, and systemic or organ toxicity. Local drug delivery can mitigate these obstacles, however, the drug must still be distributed over sufficiently large tissue volume to achieve the desired efficacy. In the field of drug delivery, quantitative, high resolution spatial analysis of drug distribution in the brain and other organs poses a challenge. To address this issue, we introduce a computational pipeline to reconstruct and quantify 3D distribution of locally delivered viral vectors from 2D microscopy images of subsampled brain sections. This pipeline, which combined existing and newly developed machine-learning and other computational tools, effectively removed false positive artifacts abundant in large-scale images of uncleared tissue sections, and subsampling adequately predicted the dispersion of model viral vectors from the point of local drug delivery. Furthermore, the pipeline successfully captured differences in the distribution of adeno virus (AdV) and adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors exhibiting varying sizes and transport properties. Notably, the proposed method is directly applicable to the distribution studies of therapeutics in large animal models. Thus, our developed pipeline is an accessible tool that can aid the research and development of local drug delivery strategies for the treatment of CNS diseases with viral vectors and potentially other therapeutics.",Neuroimage.

40568349,"Unraveling the Gut-Liver-Brain Axis: Microbiome, Inflammation, and Emerging Therapeutic Approaches.","The gut-liver-brain axis (GLB axis) plays a crucial role in maintaining metabolic, immune, and neurological homeostasis. The gut microbiota influences systemic health through its metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids (BAs), and tryptophan (Trp) derivatives, which regulate immune function, lipid metabolism, and neurotransmitter balance. Dysbiosis is an imbalance in gut microbiota that has been implicated in metabolic dysfuntion associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), alcohol-associated liver disease (AALD), and neuroinflammatory conditions such as schizophrenia. Increased gut permeability allows microbial byproducts like lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) to enter the liver and brain, activating inflammatory pathways that contribute to disease progression. Moreover, hepatic dysfunction can lead to neuroinflammation and cognitive impairments. Understanding the interplay between microbial metabolites and host physiology provides insight into novel therapeutic interventions. Strategies such as probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, fecal microbiota transfer (FMT), and postbiotics offer potential treatments to restore gut eubiosis and mitigate disease severity. This review highlights the mechanistic role of the GLB axis in health and disease, emphasizing microbiome-targeted therapies as a promising avenue for managing metabolic and neuropsychiatric disorders. <b>Trial Registration:</b> ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04823676, NCT02496390, NCT06024681, NCT02721264.",Mediators of inflammation,2025,Hiral Aghara; Manali Patel; Prashsti Chadha; Kirti Parwani; Ruchi Chaturvedi; Palash Mandal
40568319,Microendoscopic calcium imaging in motor cortices of macaques during rest and movement.,"The study of motor cortices in non-human primates is relevant to our understanding of human motor control, both in healthy conditions and in movement disorders. Calcium imaging and miniature microscopes allow the study of multiple genetically identified neurons with excellent spatial resolution. We used this method to examine activity patterns of projection neurons in deep layers of the supplementary motor (SMA) and primary motor areas (M1) in four rhesus macaques. We implanted gradient index lenses and expressed GCaMP6f to image calcium transients while the animals were at rest or engaged in an arm-reaching task. We tracked the activity of SMA and M1 neurons across conditions, examined cell pairs for synchronous activity, and assessed whether SMA and M1 neuronal activation followed specific sequential activation patterns. We demonstrate the value of <i>in vivo</i> calcium imaging for studying patterns of activity in groups of corticofugal neurons in SMA and M1.",iScience,2025,Anne-Caroline Martel; Damien Pittard; Annaelle Devergnas; Benjamin Risk; Jonathan J Nassi; Waylin Yu; Joshua D Downer; Thomas Wichmann; Adriana Galvan
40568294,Managing Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) in the Digital Era: Overcoming Barriers to Lifestyle Change.,"Obesity presents a significant global health challenge due to its association with a range of systemic disorders. One such condition is metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which has become the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. The prevalence of MASLD is closely linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and sedentary lifestyles, posing substantial risks for liver-related morbidity and extrahepatic complications such as cardiovascular and renal diseases. Despite recent advancements in pharmacological treatments, lifestyle modification remains the cornerstone of MASLD management. This review summarizes current evidence on lifestyle interventions, focusing on weight loss, dietary improvements, and increased physical activity. It also explores barriers to implementation, including socioeconomic factors, limited patient awareness, and stigma, while highlighting innovative strategies such as group-based programs, web-based interventions, and mobile technologies. As MASLD continues to rise globally, prioritizing lifestyle-based and scalable approaches will be critical to reducing its burden and improving patient outcomes.",Cureus,2025,Stanislav Kravchuk; Mykola Bychkov; Marko Kozyk; Olena Strubchevska; Aleksandra Kozyk
40568257,Neurological Complications in a Patient With Thalassemia Intermedia and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia: A Case of Extramedullary Hematopoiesis-Induced Spinal Cord Compression.,"Extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) is a rare but significant compensatory response to chronic ineffective erythropoiesis, frequently seen in hematologic disorders such as thalassemia intermedia (TI) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). While EMH is typically asymptomatic, it can manifest as paraspinal masses that cause spinal cord compression, resulting in severe neurological deficits. This case highlights the complexities in managing overlapping hematologic conditions and emphasizes the importance of timely diagnosis and intervention. We present a 50-year-old male with a longstanding history of TI and CML, who developed progressive lower extremity weakness, gait instability, and sensory deficits due to spinal cord compression from EMH. This case underscores the critical need for clinical awareness and early intervention in patients with hematologic disorders who present with neurological symptoms. EMH-induced spinal cord compression, though rare, can lead to significant morbidity if left untreated. Multidisciplinary management involving neurology, hematology, radiology, and rehabilitation is essential to optimize outcomes and prevent permanent neurological deficits in affected patients.",Cureus,2025,Ozlem Onder; Sahin Isik; Ersen Ceylan
40568231,Clinical characteristics of tic disorders in children and adolescents with the chief complaint of abnormal blinking.,"Abnormal blinking is a common symptom shared by allergic conjunctivitis (AC), dry eye disease (DED), and tic disorders (TD). This study explored clinical manifestations of TD in patients with the chief complaint of abnormal blinking; its goal was to reduce misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis. In total, 1054 patients with the chief complaint of abnormal blinking completed a questionnaire and underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examinations and mental health assessments. Questionnaire data were compiled for patients with a confirmed diagnosis of TD; their clinical characteristics were analyzed. Of the 1054 patients presenting with abnormal blinking, 453 (42.98%) were diagnosed with a TD. Among these 453 patients, 253 (55.63%) had provisional tic disorder (PTD). 121 (26.71%) patients initially were misdiagnosed (primarily with AC) or experienced a missed diagnosis; Patients with PTD were more likely to seek ophthalmologic care, whereas those with CTD or TS were more likely to visit a paediatrician (P<0.001). The predominant eye tics were excessive and/or frequent blinking; 438 (96.69%) patients exhibited tics other than eye tics. Among the TD patients, 371 (81.90%) reported ocular symptoms, whereas 336 (74.17%) had comorbid eye diseases including AC and DED. PTD patients with AC had higher incidences of allergic rhinitis and asthma compared with patients displaying CTD and TS (P<0.05). TD are major causes of abnormal blinking, and PTD is the most common subtype. TD patients with abnormal blinking often have comorbid eye diseases, primarily AC and DED.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2025,Na Tang; Yunjiao Wang; Xiaohan Jiang; Huan Liu; Yan Li; Jia Qu; Shengjin Xiang
40568112,A novel frameshift mutation in Phosphoinositide 3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 ( <i>PIK3R1</i> ) causes immunodeficiency and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).,"Mutations in <i>PIK3R1</i> , a regulatory subunit of Class I PI3K, are implicated in immune disorders and neurological conditions. We identified a novel heterozygous pathogenic frameshift mutation (c.1710dup) in <i>PIK3R1</i> in a patient with common variable immunodeficiency who developed slowly progressive Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived motor neurons (iMNs) demonstrated that this mutation resulted in <i>PIK3R1</i> haploinsufficiency, with downstream activation of AKT, disruption of neuronal electrical function and increased apoptosis in iPSC-derived motor neurons. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes showed apoptosis pathways were upregulated in neuronal clusters from iMNs harboring the <i>PIK3R1</i> c.1710 dup mutation. Mutated iPSC-derived brain organoids were smaller than matched controls. scRNA-seq of brain organoids showed more active apoptosis in neuronal clusters of patient-derived brain organoids. These findings identify a critical and novel role for <i>PIK3R1</i> haploinsufficiency in neuronal function and survival.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2025,Brice Calco; Colin L Sweeney; Joseph Steiner; Tongguang Wang; Tovah E Markowitz; Subrata Paul; Bianca Palicha; Sara Dinges; Kelsey Yoo; Lisa Henderson; Valerie McDonald; Suk See De Ravin; Benjamin Greenberg; Christa S Zerbe; Luigi D Notarangelo; Steven M Holland; Avindra Nath; Farinaz Safavi
40568088,Large-scale HLA immunopeptidome and interactome profiling in microglia.,"Microglia are immune cells of the brain and act as major antigen presenting cells. Antigen presentation involves the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex, which is implicated in genetic risk of multiple neurodegenerative diseases. How HLA affects the function of microglia in the context of neurodegenerative disease remains unclear. Here, we investigated the HLA epitopes and their protein interactome in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia-like cells (iMGLs) using systematic mass spectrometry (MS)-based immunopeptidomics, whole-cell proteomics, affinity purification, and prediction algorithms. Our results revealed the presence of almost 7,000 peptides presented by HLA class I and II within microglia. We further showed that the immunopeptidome landscapes of iPSCs, iMGLs and interferon-gamma (IFNγ) stimulated iMGLs are all readily distinguishable. Furthermore, HLA interacts with different groups of proteins in iPSCs compared to iMGLs which involve proteins in immune response. Importantly, we detected 25 HLA epitopes derived from 15 genes associated with Alzheimer's and related dementias such as Tau, PLD3 (Alzheimer's disease), TDP-43, FUS (Frontotemporal dementia), and PARK7, VPS35 (Lewy Body dementia). We predicted 31 mutant epitopes derived from these ADRD genes that could be presented with strong interaction to HLA molecules. Along with these epitopes, we observed an enrichment of immune-related interaction proteins in microglia treated with IFNγ. These results provide evidence that aggregated and mutated proteins can interact with HLA alleles and be presented on the cell surface by microglia cells. This study sheds light on the antigen presenting and adaptive immunity mechanism within the central nervous system and its possible effects on neurodegenerative diseases.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2025,Sydney Klaisner; Ying Hao; Alexandra Beilina; Jae-Hyeon Park; Ziyi Li; Michiyo Iba; Cole Tindall; Benjamin Jin; Jacob Epstein; Isabelle Kowal; Caroline B Pantazis; Nicole Carmiol; Paige Jarreau; Nicole Washecka; Cory Weller; Mike A Nalls; Kendall Van Keuren-Jensen; Andrew B Singleton; Mark R Cookson; Yue Andy Qi
40568008,Clinical Spectrum and Dynamics of Sequelae Following Tick-Borne Encephalitis Virus Infection: A Systematic Literature Review.,"Infection with the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) can affect the nervous system and lead to significant morbidity. To summarize current knowledge of long-term outcomes following TBEV infection, we systematically reviewed the prevalence of TBEV infection sequelae after hospital discharge across different age groups and follow-up time points. Studies of adults, children, and ""all-age"" populations with laboratory-confirmed TBEV infection were identified via electronic database searches. Study categorization was based on follow-up time after hospital discharge: ≤6, 7 to ≤12, or >12 months. Sequelae signs/symptoms were divided into 3 categories: neurological, neuropsychiatric, and other. Data were normalized using weighted means. Heterogeneity was estimated using a meta-analytic random-effects model. Fifteen studies were eligible for analysis (13 included only hospitalized patients). Seventy-nine unique sequelae symptoms were identified. Adults had a higher frequency of persistent symptoms than children (20.6%-100% vs 1.7%-69%). There were high levels of data heterogeneity (<i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> > 90%) among all studies. Although the proportion of patients with each sequela fluctuated across time, headache was reported by ≥20% of patients at all time points. Some sequelae also varied by age group; for example, irritability was more frequent in children, while insomnia/sleep disorders were more frequent in adults. Predominant neurological symptoms included balance disorders and headache. Predominant neuropsychiatric symptoms included concentration and memory disorders. Patients experience a variety of neurological, neuropsychiatric, or other sequelae symptoms following TBEV infection that vary over time and across age groups. This study highlights the need for standardized symptom categorization and follow-up time for TBE sequelae studies.",Open forum infectious diseases,2025,Kate Halsby; Liesl Gildea; Pingping Zhang; Frederick J Angulo; Andreas Pilz; Jennifer Moisi; Ann Colosia; Johann Sellner
40568004,Risk and Distribution of Metastatic Infections by Primary Infection Focus in <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> Bacteremia.,"<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> bacteremia (SAB) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, with a high risk of metastatic infections. Understanding the timing and distribution of metastatic infections based on the primary infection focus is crucial for effective management. We aimed to identify patterns that could guide clinicians in prioritizing surveillance and interventions for patients at high risk of metastatic infection. This retrospective cohort study analyzed 1725 patients diagnosed with SAB. We assessed the incidence and distribution of metastatic infections within the cohort, stratifying the data by the timing postdiagnosis and the primary infection focus. In the cohort of 1725 patients, 289 (16.7%) experienced a total of 439 metastatic infection events within the 90-day follow-up period. The majority of metastatic infections (approximately 85%) occurred within the first 7 days following diagnosis. The incidence of metastatic infections varied significantly with the primary focus of SAB, being highest in patients with endocarditis at 73.4%. The lung was the most frequent metastatic site (23.7%), followed by bones and joints (16.8%) and the central nervous system (12.3%). The distribution of metastatic sites significantly differed according to the primary infection focus. Our study findings provide essential insights into the risk and distribution of metastatic infections in patients with SAB, highlighting the critical role of the timing and primary infection focus. These findings enable healthcare professionals to adopt a more proactive and targeted approach to managing patients with SAB.",Open forum infectious diseases,2025,Seongman Bae; Min Soo Kook; Euijin Chang; Jiwon Jung; Min Jae Kim; Yong Pil Chong; Sung-Han Kim; Sang-Ho Choi; Sang-Oh Lee; Yang Soo Kim

We conducted a prospective, longitudinal cohort study with a nested mixed methods study in 2 Johannesburg, South Africa, facilities. Participants were PWHIV on antiretroviral therapy initiating TPT between August and December 2023. We measured TPT adherence and completion with electronic medication boxes. We used validated tools to measure symptoms of anxiety, depression, alcohol use, and other substance use at enrollment and 12 weeks. We constructed multivariable regression models to determine associations of these variables with TPT adherence and completion, adjusting for age, sex, and time on antiretroviral therapy. We interviewed participants about mental health and experiences with TPT and analyzed responses using deductive content analysis. Among 224 PWHIV, 111 (50%) completed TPT. Eighty-one (36%) screened positive for depression symptoms and 63 (28%) for anxiety symptoms. Seventy-six (34%) reported unhealthy alcohol use and 60 (27%) tobacco use. Using multivariable models adjusting for confounders, only depression symptoms were significantly and negatively associated with adherence (9% fewer doses; 95% confidence interval, .4-16; <i>P</i> = .032) and completion (odds ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, .26-.90; <i>P</i> = .021). Participant narratives highlighted the negative influence of mental health on adherence and the need for social and psychological support services. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, unhealthy alcohol use, and tobacco use were common among PWHIV initiating TPT. Depression symptoms were strongly and independently associated with TPT nonadherence and noncompletion.",Open forum infectious diseases,2025,Ann E Johnson; Lucy Chimoyi; Sheela Shenoi; Marie A Brault; Laura Forastiere; Salome Charalambous; Violet Chihota; J Lucian Davis
40567980,The association between perceived COVID-19-related discrimination and probable depression among pregnant women in the post-pandemic era: a cross-sectional study.,"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has substantially influenced the physical and psychological wellbeing of populations who survived the pandemic. Discrimination against infected individuals has been a public health concern and has been identified as a risk factor for mental health issues. However, limited empirical evidence is available to support its role in psychological disorders during the prenatal period. The current study aims to investigate the association between COVID-19-related discrimination and the likelihood of experiencing probable depression among women in their early pregnancy. A cross-sectional study was conducted from 1 May 2023 to 31 August 2023 using an anonymous online questionnaire distributed to women in their first trimester of pregnancy in the antenatal care clinic of three hospitals. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to screen antenatal depression. The logistic regression model was used to assess the relationship between COVID-19-related discrimination and antenatal depression. A total of 3,608 pregnant women were enrolled in this study, of whom 657 screened positive for antenatal depression (AND), resulting in a prevalence of 18.2%. More than one-third of the participants experienced COVID-19-related discrimination. The logistic regression analysis demonstrated a greater prevalence of probable depression among pregnant women who experienced COVID-19-related discrimination compared with those who did not. This study provided novel evidence for the association between COVID-19-related discrimination and probable depression in pregnant women, highlighting an associated factor for supportive interventions that may be relevant in the post-pandemic era.",Frontiers in public health,2025,Peiqin Liang; Yu Chen; Runjun Li; Yan Liu; Ribo Xiong

Data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 database were analyzed to look at the global, national, and regional burden of depressive disorders among individuals aged 15-39 from 1990 to 2021. Incidence rates, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and contributions of various risk factors to DALYs were also examined in this research. All incidence and disability-adjusted life year (DALY) rates were calculated per 100,000 population and are presented with corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). The burden of disease through 2050 was projected using Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) modeling. Globally, the incidence in 2021 was estimated at 158,696,139.89 cases (95% UI, 129,182,271.23-197,238,491.78), with associated DALYs totaling 25,093,054.94 (95% UI, 16,739,757.06-35,139,293.90). Between 1990 and 2021, the incidence rose by 62.91% (95% UI, 57.91-68.12%), while DALYs increased by 60.46% (95% UI, 55.99-64.91%). The highest estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) for both incidence [2.63%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.45-2.82%] and DALYs (2.72%; 95% CI, 2.57-2.88%) were identified in low Socio-demographic Index (SDI) regions. Western Europe had the most cases (9,939,816.39; 95% UI, 8,081,380.82-12,409,843.00) among the 21 geographic regions examined in 2021. Globally, India exhibited the most significant burden in 2021, with incident cases reaching 32,241,303.32 (95% UI, 26,251,449.50-39,943,511.76). Furthermore, the largest burden of DALYs was observed in India, amounting to 5,034,818.12 (95% UI, 3,363,390.70-7,076,632.70). The global burden was primarily attributed to several significant risk factors, including exposure to behavioral risks, experiences of bullying victimization, incidents of childhood sexual abuse, experiences of childhood sexual abuse and bullying, as well as intimate partner violence. Projections extending to 2050 indicate an ongoing upward trend in the incidence rate within this demographic group during this period. Overall, the burden of depressive disorders in this population has shown a marked increase, especially in low-SDI regions. A comprehensive understanding of the epidemiology of depressive disorders among adolescents and young adults is essential to enhance disease prevention and control efforts.",Frontiers in public health,2025,Le Zhao; Yan Lou; Yuexian Tao; Hangsai Wang; Nan Xu
40567964,Associations between local rates of violence and experiences of psychosis in Trinidad.,"Individual-level exposure to violence is known to influence various aspects of the experience of psychosis. This study aimed to assess the impact of local violence rates on the symptom profiles and outcomes of people with psychosis, their exposure to trauma and other potential risk and protective factors, and interactions with the police and mental health services, in a Caribbean country with high rates of violent crime. Data from 212 people with psychosis and matched population control participants were collected through a population-based programme of research on psychosis in Trinidad (INTREPID II) and linked geographically with crime statistics, disaggregated to the areas surrounding each police station. There was no evidence of a substantive association between local rates of violent crime and symptoms of psychosis or the course of illness on most measures, although people in lower crime areas appeared to be more likely to experience hallucinations than those living in high-violence areas (β-0.30, 95% CI -0.50--0.11, <i>p</i> < 0.01). There was some evidence that people living in high-violence areas were more likely to be restrained within the mental health system than those from lower-violence areas (OR 2.00, 95% CI 0.98-4.09, <i>p</i> = 0.06), despite being no more likely to act in violent or disruptive ways. The lack of association between violent crime and various aspects of psychosis may indicate that the psychological effect of violent crime is not confined to single localities, and may be influenced by other factors besides rates of violence in participants' immediate local area. Research is needed to investigate why individuals from disadvantaged neighbourhoods that are associated with gang violence experience different treatment within health services and to evaluate strategies to address these disparities.",Frontiers in public health,2025,Tessa Roberts; Joni Lee Pow; Casswina Donald; Diego Quattrone; Gerard Hutchinson; Craig Morgan
40567890,Functional connectivity of subsystems of the default-mode network in patients with early psychotic symptoms.,"Resting-state connectivity of the default-mode network (DMN) is aberrant in patients with chronic psychotic disorders as well in individuals with early stage psychosis. Studies of the DMN in healthy volunteers revealed that the DMN comprises several subnetworks. However, it is not yet clear if connectivity between and within these DMN subnetworks is aberrant in patients with early psychotic symptoms nor whether these connectivity patterns are related to symptomatology. This initial investigation examined functional connectivity between and within the DMN subnetworks in patients with early psychotic symptoms and in healthy volunteers, and probed how these connectivity patterns were related to the severity of clinical symptomatology. Functional connectivity was measured during resting-state in 30 patients with early psychotic symptoms and in 39 controls using functional MRI. We did not observe differences in connectivity within and between the subnetworks of the DMN between the control group and the early psychosis group. However, lower functional connectivity between the medial prefrontal and posterior medial subnetworks and between medial prefrontal and anterior temporal subnetworks of the DMN did predict the severity of the negative symptoms. The findings of this initial investigation provide insight into the associations between functional connectivity of DMN subnetworks and symptomatology in patients with early psychotic symptoms.",Neuroimage.

40567880,Beyond one-size-fits-all: managing mental health calls with the integrated Behavioral Emergency Assessment and Response (iBEAR) model.,"Several countries have committed to improving law enforcement response to behavioral emergencies through mental health crisis response and intervention training as well as by implementing crisis intervention team programs. However, these measures often rely primarily on traditional crisis intervention methods adapted from clinical settings. At the same time, not all behavioral emergencies constitute a mental health crisis and can be responded to with a single generic approach. Psychiatric disorders, intellectual and developmental disabilities, and/or adverse life circumstances can also result in behaviors that are below crisis threshold but still prompt emergency calls. Such presentations reflect maladaptive coping mechanisms rather than a complete loss of coping capacity seen during acute crisis and include, for instance, drug-seeking criminal behaviors in individuals with substance use disorders or self-stimulatory behaviors in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, particularly when such behaviors violate social norms. Crisis intervention alone fails to fully address the complex nature of these incidents. Currently, no existing framework effectively integrates guidelines for first responders to manage both acute crises and maladaptive behaviors that do not stem from a crisis state. To fill this gap, we propose the integrated Behavioral Emergency Assessment and Response (iBEAR) model as a theory-driven framework that equips first responders with evidence-based assessment, decision-making, and response strategies, easy to access while managing potentially dynamic and stressful behavioral emergencies. The model responds to well-documented demand for enhanced training and preparedness in managing behavioral emergencies, while also addressing the increasing burden of such incidents on emergency services.",Frontiers in psychology,2025,Benni Zaiser; Mario S Staller; Swen Koerner
40567830,Depressive and Insomnia Symptoms Among Older Adults With Different Chronic Pain Trajectories: A Network Analysis Based on Observation Over an Eight-Year Period.,"<b>Background:</b> Depressive and insomnia symptoms are common among older adults with chronic pain. We aimed to examine different chronic pain trajectories of older adults over an 8-year observation period and explore the network structures of depression and insomnia in each chronic pain group. <b>Methods:</b> The trajectories of pain in the USA-based Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data from 2010 to 2018 were examined using latent class growth analyses (LCGA) method. Depressive and insomnia symptoms were measured with the eight-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CESD-8) Scale and the four-item Jenkins Sleep Scale (JSS-4), respectively. Network models were constructed using the Ising model. Central symptoms and bridge symptoms were identified via expectedInfluence (EI) and bridge EI, respectively. <b>Results:</b> A total of 11,132 older adults were included in the trajectory analysis, with three chronic pain trajectories identified, including ""severe pain trajectory,"" ""moderate pain trajectory,"" and ""non or mild pain trajectory"". From these trajectories, ""Lack of happiness"" (CESD4), ""Feeling depressed"" (CESD1), and ""Feeling sad"" (CESD7) emerged as the most central symptoms, while ""Feeling tired in the morning"" (JSS4) was identified as the key bridge symptom. However, the findings may not be generalizable to other parts of the world outside the USA. <b>Conclusion:</b> Older adults with different chronic pain trajectories exhibited similar depression and insomnia network structure. Implementing timely interventions that target central and bridge symptoms might mitigate the co-occurrence of depression and insomnia in this population.",Depression and anxiety,2025,He-Li Sun; Pan Chen; Wei Bai; Yuan Feng; Sha Sha; Zhaohui Su; Teris Cheung; Chee H Ng; Qinge Zhang; Yu-Tao Xiang
40567829,How Do Patients' Fear Prediction and Fear Experience Impact Exposure-Based Therapy for Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia? A Comprehensive Analysis of Fear Prediction.,"Expectancy violation has been proposed as a potential core mechanism of action in psychotherapy, particularly in exposure therapy for anxiety disorders. However, various relevant expectations have been discussed, and empirical studies examining their significance are still scarce. This study aimed to investigate one specific form of expectancy violation, based on Rachman's (1994) match-mismatch model, specifically by comparing expected and experienced fear and examining their relationship to safety behaviour during exposure in vivo in 268 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for panic disorder with agoraphobia. Participants underwent exposure to a highly controlled manual-based cognitive behaviour therapy in a randomised multicenter psychotherapy study. Participants tended to overpredict fear during exposure. Both expected and experienced fear significantly decreased over the course of repeated exposure exercises, while prediction (in)accuracy (difference between expected and experienced fear) remained stable. The decrease in expected fear over time was a strong predictor of treatment outcomes for the Bodily Sensations Questionnaire (BSQ) and Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS) at post. Even more, the reduction in expected fear was a significant predictor of treatment success across all outcome measures in the follow-up assessment. These findings suggest that violating excessive fear expectancies is not a necessary condition for symptom reduction during exposure therapy.",Depression and anxiety,2025,Marina Hilleke; Thomas Lang; Sylvia Helbig-Lang; Georg W Alpers; Volker Arolt; Jürgen Deckert; Thomas Fydrich; Alfons O Hamm; Tilo Kircher; Jan Richter; Andreas Ströhle; Hans-Ulrich Wittchen; Alexander L Gerlach
40567719,Vision-based approach to knee osteoarthritis and Parkinson's disease detection utilizing human gait patterns.,"Recently, the number of cases of musculoskeletal and neurological disorders, such as knee osteoarthritis (KOA) and Parkinson's disease (PD), has significantly increased. Numerous clinical methods have been proposed in research to diagnose these disorders; however, a current trend in diagnosis is through human gait patterns. Several researchers proposed different methods in this area, including gait detection utilizing sensor-based data and vision-based systems that include both marker-based and marker-free techniques. The majority of current studies are concerned with the classification of Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, many vision-based algorithms rely on human gait silhouettes or gait representations and employ traditional similarity-based methodologies. However, in this study, a novel approach is proposed in which spatiotemporal features are extracted <i>via</i> deep learning methods with a transfer learning paradigm. Following that, advanced deep learning approaches, including sequential models like gated recurrent unit (GRU), are used for additional analysis. The experimentation is performed on the publicly available KOA-PD-normal dataset comprising gait videos with various abnormalities, and the proposed model has the highest accuracy of approximately 94.81%.",PeerJ.

40567554,Exploring Nicotine Dependence Among People Using Methamphetamine During Methadone Maintenance Treatment in Vietnam.,"Cigarette smoking is common among individuals with substance use disorders and those undergoing addiction treatment. Cigarette use is highly comorbid with methamphetamine use, and among individuals who co-use methamphetamine and opioids, nicotine dependence may further complicate smoking cessation efforts. This study examines nicotine dependence levels and associated factors among people who use methamphetamine undergoing methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) in Vietnam. This cross-sectional analysis utilized baseline data from 667 participants enrolled in a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of various combinations of behavioral evidence-based interventions for methamphetamine use among patients on MMT in Vietnam (STAR-OM R01DA050486). Data on levels of nicotine dependence and other covariates including demographic, health status, treatment characteristics and substance use were collected. Nicotine dependence was measured using the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence, with a score of 6 or higher indicating high dependence. Logistic regression estimated the association between nicotine dependence and various psychosocial and behavioral factors. Overall, 96.7% of the participants were current smokers with 247 of them (38.3%) exhibiting high nicotine dependence. Greater severity of methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms (OR: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01-1.05) and a high risk of depression, anxiety or stress (OR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.14-2.72) were associated with increased odds of high nicotine dependence. Conversely, older age at onset of methamphetamine use was associated with lower odds of high nicotine dependence. Cigarette smoking was highly prevalent among individuals using methamphetamine during MMT, with many exhibiting high nicotine dependence. Providing smoking cessation support with efforts to manage methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms, could help improve cessation outcomes.",Substance use : research and treatment,2025,Nguyen Truong Giang; Nguyen Bich Diep; Nguyen Thu Trang; Pham Thanh Luan; Hoang Thi Hai Van; Do Van Dung; Michael Li; Chunqing Lin; Li Li; Steve Shoptaw; Le Minh Giang
40567506,Brain functional connectivity associated with cognitive deficits in younger patients at first episode of schizophrenia.,"Cognitive deficits are a core feature of schizophrenia and are influenced by the age at onset of psychosis. Both preclinical and early-onset schizophrenia patients exhibit abnormalities in the frontal cortex, parahippocampus, precuneus, and hippocampus-regions that are closely associated with cognitive deficits. This study examines whether cognitive-related functional connectivity (FC) within these regions differs in first-episode schizophrenia (FES) patients with varying ages of onset. FES patients (ages 18-45, <i>n</i> = 24) and matched healthy controls (HC, <i>n</i> = 29) were divided into younger and older subgroups based on the median age of 25 years: FES_young, FES_older, HC_young, and HC_older. All participants completed the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) and underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. FC within regions of interest (ROIs) was analyzed using the CONN toolbox. Significant cognitive differences were observed between the four groups (H = 13.447, <i>p</i> = 0.004, Rank ε<sup>2</sup> = 0.259). The most prominent differences were found between the FES_young and HC_young groups (Holm-adjusted <i>p</i> = 0.012). Cognitive deficits in FES patients were significantly associated with reduced FC between the right precuneus (A31_R) and right parahippocampal gyrus (TI_R) (rho = 0.549, <i>p</i> = 0.010, Fisher's z = 0.616). FES_young showed significantly lower FC between A31_R and TI_R compared to HC_young (Holm-adjusted <i>p</i> = 0.001). Earlier onset schizophrenia is associated with more severe cognitive deficits and specific impairments in brain functional connectivity. These findings highlight the importance of considering age of onset when assessing cognitive and neural dysfunction in schizophrenia.",Schizophrenia research.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and factors associated with PTSD among survivors of road traffic crash injuries aged not less than 18 years obtaining follow-up care in public hospitals in Kigali, Rwanda. This cross-sectional study included 288 survivors of road traffic crash injuries who were obtaining care in three public hospitals in Kigali for two months, from 1st August to 30th September 2023. The PTSD was diagnosed using a clinician-administered PTSD scale described in DSM V. Binary logistic regression was used to identify the factors linked to PTSD. The previous history of traumatic events was assessed using a Life Event Checklist for Diagnostic Statistical Manual-V (DSM-V). Of the 288 survivors, 50 (17.36%), were diagnosed to experience PTSD. The following were found to be positively associated with PTSD: age bracket of 32 to 38 (p = 0.001) and 39 to 45 years (p=0.001); absence of formal education (p=0.03); a history of family conflict (p=0.001); severe injuries (p=0.001); and; history of previous traumatic event (p=0.02).

40567365,The supporting role of Schwann cells in perineural invasion of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive cancer, with tumor cells readily disseminating to other organs through the bloodstream, lymphatic system, and nervous system, thereby impacting patients' survival rates. PDAC is often associated with perineural invasion (PNI), which not only facilitates tumor spread but may also lead to symptoms such as pain, further affecting the patient's quality of life. PNI is frequently observed in PDAC and has become an important histopathological marker associated with poor clinical outcomes. Many studies suggest that a high density of Schwann cells (SCs) is typically found in areas of PNI in PDAC. What's more, as the primary glial cells in the PNS, SCs actively contribute to pancreatic tumour progression by releasing substances capable of interacting with cancer cells and promoting cancer cells proliferation and migration in tumor microenvironment (TME). Therefore, SCs are crucial in the interactions between nerves and tumors as the primary glial cells within PNS. In this review, our objective is to present novel insights and perspectives for PDAC therapy that targets SCs and related signal pathways to decrease PNI, thereby reduce pain and prolong survival in cancer patients. We detail and summarize the multiple mechanisms by which SCs promote PNI in tumors and thus lead to malignancy.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2025,Yun He; Zheng Chen; Liu Yang; Shuanying Qiao; Zonghua Su; Feng Ding; Fadian Ding; Fuli Xin; Siyu Xiang; Aiping Lyu; Fangfei Li
40567268,Psychiatric Disorders Mediate the Association between Floods and Dementia: A Prospective Cohort Study in the UK Biobank.,"Flooding has become more frequent and severe worldwide, leading to an increased burden of psychiatric disorders (e.g., depression and anxiety). Psychiatric disorders are associated with an increased risk of subsequent dementia. However, the associations among floods, psychiatric disorders, and dementia are still unclear. Using a population cohort from the UK Biobank, we aimed to investigate the mediating role of psychiatric disorders on the associations between floods and dementia. In this study, cumulative exposure to floods over an eight-year period preceding the study baseline was assessed for each participant at residential addresses. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to study the associations of flooding exposure with psychiatric disorders and dementia. Stratified analyses and mediation analyses were conducted to examine whether psychiatric disorders mediate the relationship between floods and dementia. During a median follow-up of 12.3 years (interquartile range: 11.6-13.0), 0.9% (2,028) of participants developed dementia and 9.5% (21,629) were diagnosed with psychiatric disorders. The flooding exposure was associated with an 8.0% increased risk of incident dementia (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 1.080, 95% CI: 1.023-1.141). The flood-dementia association was observed to be partially mediated by several subtypes of psychiatric disorders (overall proportion of mediation: 75.7%), with psychotic disorder accounting for 49.7% (indirect effect HR: 1.039, 95% confidence interval: 1.015-1.064) of flood-related dementia, followed by stress-related disorder (proportion of mediation: 18.1%), and depression (proportion of mediation: 3.9%). This study provides evidence of an increased risk of dementia associated with exposure to floods, with psychiatric disorders playing a crucial mediating role in the flood-related dementia pathway. These findings suggest that flooding exposure is a critical risk factor for dementia, and targeted interventions addressing postdisaster mental health may be crucial for dementia prevention in affected populations.","Environment & health (Washington, D.C.)",2025,Yao Wu; Bo Wen; Danijela Gasevic; Rongbin Xu; Zhengyu Yang; Pei Yu; Yanming Liu; Guowei Zhou; Yan Zhang; Jiangning Song; Hong Liu; Shanshan Li; Yuming Guo

The main pathophysiological mechanism of this syndrome is a widespread ischemia-reperfusion damage, then there are other pathological alterations involving various organs which, if untreated, can evolve into multiorgan dysfunction. For this reason, a series of diagnostic-therapeutic actions (bundles) are necessary to ensure a correct management of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome: adequate oxygenation and ventilation, hemodynamic stabilization, temperature control, early prediction of neurological outcome, optimization of metabolic aspects, indication and timing of coronary angiography. The management of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome, the fifth link in the chain of survival, consists of a set of early, complex and multidisciplinary interventions, which must be promptly started, immediately after a return of spontaneous circulation, regardless of the location of cardiac arrest presentation, and it aims to obtain a good hemodynamic and neurological recovery.

40567179,"Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs, Carbamazepine and Phenytoin, on Plasma Concentrations of Clozapine and Its N-Desmethyl and N-Oxide Metabolites in Japanese Patients With Schizophrenia.","Clozapine (CLZ) is used for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. However, in Japanese patients, its pharmacokinetics are still not well described, and there are no case reports about drug interactions between CLZ and concomitant antiepileptics that can affect cytochrome P450 (CYP) activity, because CLZ is mainly metabolized by CYP. In two Japanese cases, for therapeutic drug monitoring, the trough plasma concentrations of CLZ, N-desmethyl clozapine (NCLZ) and N-oxide clozapine (OCLZ) were measured, and the ratios of them and the daily dose (D) were used as indicators of drug metabolism. In a male patient in his 20s, the CLZ/D ratio ([ng/mL]/[mg/day]) was significantly decreased, and both NCLZ/CLZ and OCLZ/CLZ ratios were significantly increased with carbamazepine, relative to CLZ alone. In another male patient in his 30s, the CLZ/D ratio was lower with phenytoin than without phenytoin. The NCLZ/CLZ ratio was higher with phenytoin than without phenytoin. Despite these expectations, the OCLZ/CLZ ratio showed a slight decrease with phenytoin. These results in the two Japanese cases demonstrate the effects of antiepileptics on plasma concentrations, not only of CLZ but also of its major metabolites NCLZ and OCLZ. Metabolism-enhancing interactions with CLZ were demonstrated for carbamazepine, a CYP3A4- and CYP1A2-inducer. However, for phenytoin, which is also known as a CYP3A4-inducer, the drug interactions with CLZ were not very clear due to the small limited data. These pharmacokinetic findings in only two cases must be confirmed by further investigations.",Neuropsychopharmacology reports,2025,Kazuro Ikawa; Tomoya Imura; Saori Nakamura; Kanae Murata; Norifumi Morikawa; Mutsumi Sakata; Hidenori Yasuzawa; Naoki Horikawa
40567162,From injury to recovery: Spatiotemporal dynamics of the visual pathway during spontaneous structural and functional regeneration after optic nerve transection in zebrafish.,"In adult mammals, optic nerve injury leads to irreversible vision loss due to its extremely limited regenerative capacity. In contrast, adult zebrafish possess a robust capacity for spontaneous visual system regeneration, although the spatiotemporal coordination of recovery across the retina, optic nerve, and brain remains poorly understood. In the present study, the regenerative dynamics following optic nerve transection were systematically characterized in adult zebrafish over a 5 week period using hematoxylin-eosin staining, immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy, single-cell RNA sequencing, and optokinetic response (OKR) behavioral assessments. At 1 week post-injury (1 wpi), retinal ganglion cell depletion was evident but showed significant recovery by 2 wpi. Concurrently, the injured optic nerve displayed a marked increase in diameter and cell number at 2 wpi, including widespread expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, consistent with heightened proliferative activity. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling at 2 wpi revealed five principal cell populations: fibroblasts, mural cells, immune cells, mature oligodendrocytes, and myelin-forming oligodendrocytes. By 4-5 wpi, remyelination within the optic nerve and re-establishment of synaptic architecture in the optic tectum were strongly correlated with functional restoration of OKR behavior. These findings provide a comprehensive spatiotemporal framework of visual pathway regeneration in zebrafish, establishing a valuable model for elucidating conserved mechanisms of neural repair with translational potential for human vision restoration.",Zoological research,2025,Bao-Guo Shen; Yuan Wen; Sheng-Jian Lu; Hong-Yuan Wei; Shu-Rui Huang; Guang-Ming Zhou; Wen-Tao Yan; Wen-Can Wu; Yi-Kui Zhang
40567153,Efficacy and Safety of Histamine H3 Receptor Antagonist/Inverse Agonist Including Betahistine for Schizophrenia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Whether histamine H3 receptor antagonists (H3R-ANTs)/inverse agonists (H3R-IAs) provides benefit for the treatment of schizophrenia remains unclear. This meta-analysis was conducted to address the above clinical question. Cognitive Function Scale's composite score (primary), seven domains of cognitive function (speed of processing, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning/problem solving, and social cognition) score, University of California San Diego Performance-Based Skills Assessment score, psychopathology scales score, discontinuation rate, and incidence of individual adverse events were among the study outcomes. The standardized mean differences (SMD) or risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Our meta-analysis included 11 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (n = 754). Our study evaluated ABT-288, betahistine, betahistine+reboxetine, GSK239512, MK-0249, and pitolisant. Betahistine has an H1-receptor agonistic reaction and H3-receptor antagonistic reaction, while other drugs only have an H3-receptor antagonistic/inverse agonistic reaction. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis for all outcomes divided by betahistine or other pooled H3R-ANTs/H3R-IAs. The study results show that betahistine outperformed placebo in the improvement of overall cognitive symptoms (SMD [95% CI] = -0.61 [-1.03, -0.18]), speed of processing (-0.44 [-0.87, -0.02]), attention/vigilance (-0.43 [-0.85, -0.01]), working memory (-0.48 [-0.90, -0.06]), verbal learning (-0.62 [-1.04, -0.19]), visual learning (-0.57 [-1.00, -0.15]), and betahistine+reboxetine was superior in the improvement of depressive symptoms (-4.04 [-5.10, -2.97]). Pitolisant outperformed placebo in depressive symptom improvement (-3.24 [-4.22, -2.26]). However, the results were derived from one betahistine, betahistine+reboxetine, or pitolisant study. Other pooled H3R-ANTs/H3R-IAs revealed risk of insomnia (RR [95% CI] = 2.18 [1.05, 4.55]). However, no differences were observed in other any outcomes between betahistine or other pooled H3R-ANTs/H3R-IAs and placebo. Some H3R-ANTs/H3R-IAs might provide benefit for the treatment of cognitive symptoms and depressive symptoms in individuals afflicted with schizophrenia.",Neuropsychopharmacology reports,2025,Yasufumi Nishii; Kenji Sakuma; Shun Hamanaka; Nakao Iwata; Taro Kishi
40567099,Italian adaptation of Listening Effort Assessment Scale and Fatigue Assessment Scale questionnaires.,"The purpose of this study is to adapt linguistically and culturally the Listening Effort Assessment Scale (EAS) and Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) questionnaires into Italian (EAS-IT and FAS-IT) and to investigate the reliability and validity of these scales in normal hearing and hearing-impaired subjects. The Italian adaptation of the EAS and FAS questionnaires was conducted based on back and forward translation methodology. Both questionnaires were administered to 101 normal hearing (NH) subjects and 88 hearing-impaired subjects including 19 hearing aid users (HA), 50 cochlear implant users (CI) and 19 affected by single-sided deafness (SSD). Both questionnaires showed a high reliability (Cronbach's α was 0.953 for EAS-IT and 0.837 for FAS-IT). EAS-IT showed high internal consistency with item-rest correlations. The inter-item correlation of the FAS-IT shows a difference in the internal consistency of item 4. A high significance between the NH group and the 3 hearing loss groups (HA, CI, SSD) was found for EAS-IT, but no significant difference was found between NH and the single hearing-impaired groups for FAS-IT. EAS-IT showed good internal reliability and validity and is sensitive to hearing loss.",Acta otorhinolaryngologica Italica : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di otorinolaringologia e chirurgia cervico-facciale,2025,Sara Ghiselli; Daria Salsi; Vincenzo Vincenti; Enrico Fabrizi; Patrizia Frontera; Domenico Cuda
40567091,Review of techniques and approaches for ectopic reservoir placement in inflatable penile implant.,"Inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) implantation is the gold standard treatment for patients with erectile dysfunction who are refractory to medical therapy. The standard placement of the reservoir in the space of Retzius (SOR) may be contraindicated in patients with prior pelvic or abdominal surgery due to altered anatomy and increased risk of complications. This has led to the development of alternative ectopic reservoir placement techniques. In this narrative review, we summarize the literature on various ectopic reservoir approaches, including low and high submuscular placements, submuscular techniques with counter incisions or transfascial fixation, midline submuscular placement, subcutaneous placement, and lateral retroperitoneal approaches. We describe the surgical methods, outcomes, and complication rates associated with each technique. While most methods demonstrate low complication and revision rates, direct comparisons remain limited due to heterogeneity and lack of prospective data. This review highlights the importance of individualized technique selection based on prior surgical history, body habitus, and surgeon experience. As ectopic placement becomes more widely adopted, familiarity with multiple approaches is essential for prosthetic surgeons.",The Canadian journal of urology,2025,Etan Eigner; Yacov Reisman; Nicola Fazza; Ameer Nsair; Valentin Shabataev; Ariel Zisman
40567076,Exosomal microRNA-22-3p influences oxidative stress injury and neuronal apoptosis in Alzheimer's disease via targeting KDM6B.,"This research was intended to unravel the effects of exosomal microRNA-22-3p (miR-22-3p) secreted from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on oxidative stress damage and neuronal apoptosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) via KDM6B. BMSCs and BMSCs-derived exosomes (BMSCs-Exos) were obtained and identified. An in vitro AD model was established. The levels of miR-22-3p and KDM6B were tested. Cell viability, ROS levels, MDA content and SOD levels, as well as apoptosis levels, were evaluated. The targeting relationship between miR-22-3p and KDM6B was validated. BMSC-Exos, miR-22-3p mimic and KDM6B siRNA advanced the cell viability, attenuated cell apoptosis, and ameliorated the oxidative stress injury of Aβ1-42-induced HT22 cells, including the decrease in the content of ROS and MDA and the increase in SOD activity. miR-22-3p inhibitor and KDM6B overexpression lentivirus advanced the decrease of cell viability, aggravated cell apoptosis, and promoted oxidative stress injury in Aβ1-42-induced HT22 cells, including the increase of ROS and MDA content and the decrease of SOD activity. miR-22-3p mimic combined with oe-KDM6B reversed the effects caused by miR-22-3p mimic alone. miR-22-3p targeted KDM6B. BMSC-Exos-derived miR-22-3p suppresses KDM6B expression to alleviate oxidative stress damage and apoptosis in AD neurons.",General physiology and biophysics,2025,Luzy Zhang
40567027,Knowledge and utilization of compensation strategies for Parkinson's disease in Dutch long-term care facilities: A survey among 130 healthcare professionals.,"BackgroundCompensation strategies have been shown to improve functional mobility in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) who live independently. However, knowledge on its utilization in in long-term care (LTC) settings is unknown.ObjectiveThis study aimed to establish the knowledge and utilization of compensation strategies for functional mobility for individuals with PD among healthcare professionals working in LTC facilities in the Netherlands. Secondary aims included assessing subgroup differences among healthcare professionals and exploring perceived barriers to utilizing these strategies in LTC.MethodsA cross-sectional online survey design was conducted with (allied) healthcare professionals working in LTC facilities across the Netherlands.ResultsOverall knowledge and utilization of compensation strategies among 130 healthcare professionals was high, with a median of 5 out of 7 known categories, 4 out of 7 used for gait, and 3 out of 5 for transfers. Variations among professions existed, with physiotherapists and occupational therapists demonstrating higher scores than nurses and personal care assistants. Professionals specifically trained in PD care and those working in specialized PD departments demonstrated a higher level of knowledge. Main identified barriers for utilization were limited knowledge and time of the healthcare professionals, and concerns regarding limited feasibility in patients with severe cognitive impairments.ConclusionsWhile knowledge and utilization of compensation strategies for PD in LTC facilities was widespread, the findings highlight a need for tailored training programs for healthcare professionals to improve patient care. Future research should evaluate the feasibility and usefulness of such training programs.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2025,Ties J Gaveel; Anouk Tosserams; Maarten J Nijkrake; Jorik Nonnekes
40567010,"Prescription opioid supply-restricting policies and hospital use by people prescribed opioid medications, Victoria, 2018-22: a controlled interrupted time series analysis.","To investigate the combined effect of two policies for reducing prescription opioid supply in Australia on hospital use by people prescribed opioids in primary care. Retrospective data linkage study; controlled interrupted time series analysis of linked primary care electronic medication records and hospital admissions data. Three Victorian health care networks (Monash Health, Eastern Health, Peninsula Health); pre-intervention period: 1 April 2018 - 31 March 2020; intervention period: 1 April 2020 - 31 March 2022. People prescribed opioid medications at least twice during the preceding six months (opioid group) and propensity score-matched patients, based on age, gender, comorbidity, and residential postcode-based socio-economic status (control group); matching was undertaken for each month of the study period. Mandatory prescription drug monitoring (from 1 April 2020); tighter restriction criteria for the subsidisation of opioid medications by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) (from 1 June 2020). Differences between the opioid and control groups in immediate changes after start of the intervention in rates of emergency department (ED) presentation and hospital admission related to opioid use, non-opioid substance use, self-harm, or mental health problems; differences between the two groups in the change in trend for these rates between the pre-intervention and intervention periods. Propensity matching was undertaken for 179 091 people in the opioid group and a total of 389 061 people in the control group. The opioid-related ED presentation rate for the opioid group had been increasing prior to the intervention, but declined after its introduction at a rate not significantly different from that of the control group. The immediate change in non-opioid substance-related ED presentation rate was greater for the opioid group than the control group (β, 11.1 [95% confidence interval, 1.7-20.5] presentations per 100 000 patients); by 31 March 2022, the rate had declined to below the pre-intervention level. Differences between groups in changes to self-harm- and mental health-related presentations, and in all hospital admission rates, were not statistically significant. Following implementation of two prescription opioid supply-restricting polices in 2020, the opioid-related ED presentation rate declined among people prescribed opioids; the non-opioid substance-related presentation rate initially increased, but was lower than the pre-intervention level by the end of the study period. Our findings suggest that some opioid-restricting policies can reduce opioid-related harm without increasing long term non-opioid substance- or mental health-related harm.

40567008,Depressive symptoms can negatively influence patient reported disease severity after subthalamic nucleus stimulation for Parkinson's disease.,"BackgroundDepression can negatively influence an individual's perception of their disease. Although subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is an effective treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD), some patients do not appreciate benefits despite showing objective improvements in motor function.ObjectiveWe explored the impact of depressive symptoms on self-reported outcomes of PD severity in patients who underwent STN-DBS.MethodsAssessments took place preoperatively and 2-years after surgery. Patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Parts 2 and 4, Gait and Falls Questionnaire, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39), and the Non-motor Symptoms Scale. The UPDRS Part 3 (motor examination) was also performed. Patients were dichotomized into two groups (normal or high) based on their postoperative follow-up HADS depression score.ResultsEighteen patients (33.3%) were assigned to the high group (hHADS-D), and 36 patients (66.7%) were assigned to the normal group (nHADS-D). The UPDRS Part 3 OFF-medication score improved to a similar extent in both groups, and participants experienced a similar reduction in their levodopa equivalent daily dose following STN-DBS. Unlike the nHADS-D group, however, hHADS-D patients did not self-report improvements on any clinical outcome measure at follow-up from baseline, and instead indicated a significant worsening on the UPDRS Part 2 ON-medication and PDQ-39 cognition domain. This was not explicable by their preoperative non-motor symptom burden, nor changes in dopaminergic medications. There were no differences between groups in terms of proportion using anti-depressants, surgical complications or postoperative side effects.ConclusionsDepressive symptoms may play a significant role in subjective self-reporting, and should be carefully considered when evaluating STN-DBS effectiveness and managing patients postoperatively.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2025,Christine Girges; Alexis de Roquemaurel; Nirosen Vijiaratnam; Jennifer Foley; Joseph Candelario; Maricel Salazar; Catherine Milabo; John Esperida; Tim Grover; Harith Akram; Jonathan Hyam; Marie T Krüger; Ludvic Zrinzo; Patricia Limousin; Thomas Foltynie
40566997,The Impact of Splicing Dysregulation on Neuromuscular Disorders and Current Neuromuscular Genetic Therapies.,"Eukaryotic genes contain non-coding segments known as introns, which interrupt coding sequences. Consequently, eukaryotic transcription produces precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) that relies on precise splicing to remove highly diverse introns from the genome and to generate the mature mRNA essential for maintaining normal cellular activities. The extensive heterogeneity of neurons necessitates complex splicing regulation, particularly alternative splicing, to ensure the accuracy of gene expression in neurogenesis, signal transduction, and synaptic function and to maintain stability and adaptability in the nervous system. With the improvement of genetic testing technology, aberrant splicing has been identified as a contributing factor to the pathogenesis of neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), myotonic dystrophy (DM), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), myasthenia gravis (MG), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Studying the correlation between splicing defects and neuromuscular disorders is crucial for gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases and for developing effective therapies. In this review, we introduce the intricate process and key factors of pre-mRNA splicing, with a focus on aberrant splicing and pathogenesis in several major neuromuscular disorders, providing an overview of the latest therapeutic strategies.",Journal of neurochemistry,2025,Jing Wu; Shuxuan Yan; Yuqin Bian; Rui Liu; Xinxing Lyu; Zhaoxiang Zhang; Shuhong Huang; Tao Chen; Lin Cheng
40566995,Living Through the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Experiences of People With Profound and Multiple Intellectual Disabilities Through a Family Carer Lens.,"People with profound and multiple intellectual disabilities were disproportionately negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Few studies exist about the perceived longer-term impact of the pandemic on this group. Data were collected through a two-stage narrative interview process. Six family members told their story about what their relative's lives were like at the first COVID-19 'lockdown', what their lives were like now, and what they hoped their lives would be like in the future. A second interview filled any gaps in the narrative. Data were analysed thematically. Four themes were identified: Deeping exclusion and inequality; 'I still haven't recovered'- Exhausted by the pandemic; A traumatic time-Disrupted routines, activities, and relationships and 'The future is a scary place.' The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated pre-existing health and social inequalities, leading to new uncertainties post-pandemic.

40566993,GABA-Producing Levilactobacillus brevis LAB6 Mitigates Pentylenetetrazol-Induced Gut-Brain Dysregulation in SD Rats.,"Understanding the communication between the gut and brain has emerged as a new research avenue in neurological disorders like epilepsy, with increasing evidence pointing towards the influence of intestinal microbes on the central nervous system. Here, the protective effects of a psychobiotic strain Levilactobacillus brevis LAB6 MTCC 25662 supplementation against pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindling in male Sprague Dawley rats was studied. Two GABA-producing strains Levilactobacillus brevis LAB6 and Limosilactobacillus fermentum LAB19 were screened for their protective effects against chronic PTZ-induced kindling. Chronic subconvulsive PTZ administration increased the convulsive activity, ultimately leading to generalized tonic-clonic seizures as indicated by a progressive rise in the seizure score, changes in endogenous antioxidants, and changes in inflammatory cytokines. Intervention with LAB6, but not LAB19, significantly attenuated these alterations and beneficially modulated gut health by increasing the production of short-chain fatty acids and promoting healthy gut microbes, suggesting strain-specific effects of LAB6. Further, colonization study with indocyanine green (ICG) labeled LAB6 was done, followed by dose-dependent protective efficacy of LAB6 in PTZ-induced kindling. A single dose administration (10<sup>10</sup> CFU) showed that LAB6 translocated and adhered throughout the gastrointestinal (GI) tract within 8 h of administration and reached the distal colon and cecum. The supplementation of LAB6 at a medium dose of 2 × 10<sup>10</sup> CFU was most efficient in restoring altered gut barrier functions, behavioral deficits, and modulation of peripheral GABA levels. Hence, it is a promising psychobiotic candidate for positively modulating gut-brain functions in epilepsy.",Journal of neurochemistry,2025,Tushar Matta; Mahendra Bishnoi; Shiwangi Gupta; Aanchal Aggarwal; Kanwaljit Chopra; Kanthi Kiran Kondepudi
40566959,The transfer process from child and adolescent mental health services to adult mental health services for patients with childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorders: first case-control study from Türkiye.,"The transfer from child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) to adult mental health services (AMHS) can be challenging, particularly for adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) requiring long-term follow-up. To examine the transfer process from CAMHS to AMHS in a university hospital in Türkiye, focusing on challenges, service gaps and barriers to transfer for individuals with NDDs. Hospital records of children with NDDs followed in CAMHS for at least 5 years were reviewed. Children with at least one annual admission until 2017-2018 were included. A total of 211 patients were categorised into two groups: those who transferred to AMHS by 2018-2019 (transferred group, 81 patients) and those who did not transfer (non-transferred group, 130 patients). Clinical features, such as primary diagnosis and treatments, were compared, and parental views on the transfer process were collected via telephone interviews. The transferred group included 81 patients (38.4%), whereas the non-transferred group had 130 patients (61.6%). Of the total sample, 55 (26.1%) were female, and 156 (73.9%) were male. Primary diagnoses were similar between groups; however, the transferred group had more comorbidities (<i>P</i> < 0.001) and more frequent antipsychotic prescriptions (<i>P</i> = 0.006). Proactive information from CAMHS doctors (<i>B</i> = 2.46, s.e. = 0.68, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and psychiatric comorbidities predicted transfer. In addition, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder diagnoses changed during transfer in the transferred group (<i>P</i> = 0.002). These findings emphasise the need for tailored transition support to enhance mental healthcare for NDD patients and indicate areas where further research is required to address healthcare barriers.",BJPsych open,2025,Melike Karaçam Doğan; Yağmur Karakuş Aydos; Şükrü Keleş; Halime Tuna Çak Esen; Mevhibe İrem Yildiz
40566953,Epilepsy and psychosis: navigating through a complex intersection.,"The prevalence of psychiatric disorders in people with epilepsy is as high as 43% and, among them, psychoses represent a severe comorbidity. This is a narrative review discussing the interplay between epilepsy and psychosis and identifying challenges in diagnosing and managing psychotic symptoms in epilepsy, focusing on the past 10 years. Articles published between June 2014 and December 2024 were identified through searches in PubMed using the search terms 'psychosis', 'seizure, epilepsy and convulsion', 'epile*', 'seizure*' and 'convuls*'. The association between epilepsy and psychosis was shown to be bidirectional, with people with psychosis being at increased risk of epilepsy. In epilepsy, psychotic symptoms may occur in three clinical scenarios, with clinical presentation and management varying in relationship to these: seizure-related (peri-ictal), treatment-related or independent of the former. There are no guidelines for the management of psychotic symptoms in epilepsy, but it is possible to apply policies for the treatment of psychoses, taking into account the peculiarities and needs of people with epilepsy.",BJPsych open,2025,Marco Mula; Andres M Kanner; Allan H Young; Annabella Di Giorgio; Andreas Schulze-Bonhage; Eugen Trinka
40566951,Critical components of 'Early Intervention in Psychosis': national retrospective cohort study.,"Psychotic disorders are severe mental health conditions frequently associated with long-term disability, reduced quality of life and premature mortality. Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) services aim to provide timely, comprehensive packages of care for people with psychotic disorders. However, it is not clear which components of EIP services contribute most to the improved outcomes they achieve. We aimed to identify associations between specific components of EIP care and clinically significant outcomes for individuals treated for early psychosis in England. This national retrospective cohort study of 14 874 EIP individuals examined associations between 12 components of EIP care and outcomes over a 3-year follow-up period, by linking data from the National Clinical Audit of Psychosis (NCAP) to routine health outcome data held by NHS England. The primary outcome was time to relapse, defined as psychiatric inpatient admission or referral to a crisis resolution (home treatment) team. Secondary outcomes included duration of admissions, detention under the Mental Health Act, emergency department and general hospital attendances and mortality. We conducted multilevel regression analyses incorporating demographic and service-level covariates. Smaller care coordinator case-loads and the use of clozapine for eligible people were associated with reduced relapse risk. Physical health interventions were associated with reductions in mortality risk. Other components, such as cognitive-behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp), showed associations with improvements in secondary outcomes. Smaller case-loads should be prioritised and protected in EIP service design and delivery. Initiatives to improve the uptake of clozapine should be integrated into EIP care. Other components, such as CBTp and physical health interventions, may have specific benefits for those eligible. These findings highlight impactful components of care and should guide resource allocation to optimise EIP service delivery.",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,2025,Ryan Williams; Ed Penington; Veenu Gupta; Alan Quirk; Apostolos Tsiachristas; Michelle Rickett; Carolyn A Chew-Graham; David Shiers; Paul French; Belinda Lennox; Alex Bottle; Mike J Crawford
40566933,Qishiwei Zhenzhu Pills Protect Against Cerebral Ischemia via the P53/Cytochrome C/Apoptotic Protease Activating Factor 1-Mediated Mitochondrial Apoptosis Pathway.,"Qishiwei Zhenzhu pills (QSWZZP, Tibetan name: ) originated from Ershiwuwei Zhenzhu mother pills in the eighth century AD and are currently included in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2020). QSWZZP calm the mind, activate the medians, regulate qi, and harmonize the blood. QSWZZP have significant therapeutic effects in cerebral ischemia. However, QSWZZP's complex and diverse multi-herb chemical composition has presented challenges in identifying their active ingredients, which have hitherto remained unclarified. Therefore, the present study focusses on the identification of QSWZZP's active ingredients and their therapeutic mechanisms. To analyze the distribution of QSWZZP's components in the blood and tissues for the treatment of cerebral ischemia, to identify the biomarkers after drug intervention, and to explore the mechanism of action of QSWZZP in terms of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used for qualitative and metabolomic analysis of the distribution of QSWZZP's components in the blood and tissues. A middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model was used to evaluate and measure neurobehavioral changes, the ratio of cerebral infarction, the rate of apoptosis-positive cells in the brain tissue, and the pathological changes in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and diencephalon. mRNA, protein, and fluorescence expressions of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), P53, cytochrome C (Cyt C), apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (APAF-1), cleaved caspase-8, B-cell lymphoma-extra-large, and N-myc downstream-regulated gene family member 4 (NDRG4) were determined in the rat brain tissues via real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and immunofluorescence. In addition, molecular docking was used to screen the active components of QSWZZP against mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Thirty-three new compounds were identified, including 13 triterpenoids and nine flavonoids. Among them, 15 blood-entry, 21 urine-entry, three brain-entry, seven liver-entry, and four kidney-entry components were identified. QSWZZP significantly improved neurobehavioral abnormalities and reduced the cerebral infarction rate in the MCAO rats by significantly decreasing AIF, P53, Cyt C, APAF-1, and cleaved caspase-8 mRNA expressions and Cyt C and APAF-1 protein expressions, as well as increasing NDRG4 protein expression in the rat brain tissues. Molecular docking revealed that the active ingredients of QSWZZP against mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis were arjunic acid, cholic acid, and phyllaemblic acid. In this study, 45 components of QSWZZP were qualitatively analyzed, and the metabolic pathways of the related products were clarified. The potential treatment mechanism of QSWZZP may be related to the modulation of the folate biosynthesis metabolic and P53/Cyt C/APAF-1-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis pathways. This study may serve as the foundation for subsequent pharmacokinetic experiments and analysis of the material basis of the drug effect of QSWZZP in cerebral ischemia treatment.",CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,2025,Yinglian Song; Guili Song; Lame Lizhen; Yan Liang; Mengtian Han; Yichu Yang; Qiaoqiao Feng; Yi Li; Jingwen Zhang; Min Xu; Yongzhong Zeweng; Miao Jiang; Zhang Wang
40566931,Electro-Acupuncture to Treat Disorder of Consciousness (AcuDoc): Study Protocol for a Randomized Sham-Controlled Trial.,"Treatment of disorders of consciousness (DOC) remains a clinical challenge. Electroacupuncture (EA) was shown to have the potential to promote the recovery of consciousness. This trial aims to explore the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of EA in patients with DOC due to traumatic brain injury (TBI) through a multimodal approach. A total of 50 adult patients with DOC due to TBI and 25 healthy subjects will be enrolled in the study. Patients enrolled in the study will be assigned to the EA group or the sham-EA group through stratified randomization. All patients receive behavioral assessments (CRS-R and brain-computer interface), neurophysiological evaluations (EEG, somatosensory evoked potentials, brainstem auditory evoked potentials), and neuroimaging evaluations (rs-fMRI, amide proton transfer, intravoxel incoherent motion, neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging) before and after the 14-day EA or sham-EA treatment. Each healthy subject will receive a set of neurophysiological and neuroimaging examinations but no treatments. The practitioner administering EA and sham-EA is the only one aware of the grouping results. In the sham-EA group, sham-acupoints, sham-acupuncture, and sham-wire are utilized. The primary outcome measurement is the change in CRS-R score after 14 days of treatment compared with the baseline CRS-R score. The AcuDoc trial will be the first randomized sham-controlled study to investigate the clinical benefits of EA in patients with DOC. This trial will elucidate the role of EA in the treatment of DOC due to TBI and provide evidence of its therapeutic mechanisms.",Brain and behavior,2025,Kaiqi Lin; Jixiang Chen; Jiahui Pan; Ruihong Wang; Shibiao Wu; Wanxing Wen; Yuanqing Li; Lixin Wang; Fang Yuan
40566929,Successful Conservative Treatment of Tracheobronchial Injury as a Complication After Emergency Tracheal Intubation in an Infant: A Case Report.,"BACKGROUND Tracheal intubation is a routine but potentially hazardous procedure, with complications ranging from mild mucosal injury to severe tracheobronchial trauma. Tracheobronchial injuries are particularly critical, with high morbidity and mortality rates, necessitating prompt diagnosis and appropriate management. However, there is no clear consensus on optimal treatment, especially in pediatric patients. CASE REPORT We present a case of a previously healthy 11-month-old girl who developed a tracheobronchial injury following endotracheal intubation for status epilepticus. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 6×4 mm tracheobronchial injury, left pneumothorax, and mediastinal emphysema. Given the minor nature of the injury, stable respiratory status, and the expectation of early extubation, conservative management was selected. The patient was treated with nasal intubation, antibacterial therapy, and close monitoring. She was successfully extubated on the second day and discharged on the tenth day without complications. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the importance of recognizing tracheobronchial injury as a potential intubation-related complication, especially in infants with fragile airway anatomy. Key factors contributing to the injury included deep tube insertion, inappropriate tube size, and elevated cuff pressure. Our experience suggests that conservative management can be a viable option in select cases of pediatric tracheobronchial injury when symptoms are minimal and early extubation is feasible. Additionally, meticulous intubation techniques, proper tube selection, and experienced personnel are critical in preventing such complications. Further studies are needed to establish standardized guidelines for managing tracheobronchial injuries in infants and young children.",The American journal of case reports,2025,Kazuki Kikuchi; Keisuke Suzuki; Kanako Sugo; Yoshitaka Tomita; Takuya Shimada; Manabu Eiraku; Chihiro Mori; Mariko Kurihara; Hiroki Yamaga; Gen Inoue; Masaharu Yagi; Kenji Dohi
40566924,Examining Brain Function Changes in HIV-Infected Patients With Asymptomatic Neurocognitive Impairment: A Longitudinal Study.,"HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), especially asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), the initial stage of HAND, persist among a substantial proportion of individuals living with HIV despite the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) focusing on ANI among HIV-related patients is rarely reported. 60 right-handed Chinese male patients with HIV-associated ANI underwent baseline and follow-up neurocognitive examination, and rs-fMRI scans over an average interval of 1.68 years. Brain function alterations were evaluated through amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF/fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and functional connectivity (FC) analyses. In this study, significant reductions in ALFF were observed in the MOG, cuneus, superior frontal gyrus, and supplementary motor area in the follow-up group compared to baseline. This was accompanied by increased ALFF in the right insula. ReHo analysis revealed decreased values in the left median cingulate, right calcarine fissure, MOG, and left precentral gyrus, alongside increased ReHo in the supramarginal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and calcarine fissure. FC analysis demonstrated decreased connectivity between the precentral gyrus and calcarine cortex and between the MOG and calcarine cortex. Correlation analysis indicated that these imaging changes were correlated with declines in specific neurocognitive domains, including memory, speed of information processing, and executive function.

40566894,Transcriptional Landscape and Biomarker Discovery for Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Alzheimer's Disease: An Ex Vivo Study Using Patients-Derived Dermal Fibroblasts.,"Numerous studies have identified various risk factors associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the experimental limitations of disease modeling make it challenging to directly interpret their effects. These limitations include constraints of postmortem samples, animal experiments, and challenges associated with brain tissue studies. Ex vivo experiments effectively address these issues by enabling patient-specific identification and highlighting potential biomarkers. This study aimed to characterize the transcriptional profile of fibroblasts derived from patients with AD in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and propose potential biomarkers. We utilized an ex vivo platform to identify genes differentially responsive to ER stress. The transcriptional feature of fibroblasts in both healthy controls (n=22) and patients with AD (n=20) was analyzed using bulk RNA sequencing. The cytotoxicity of the selected target gene was evaluated through knockdown experiments. A total of 468 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that 210 DEGs, which were less responsive in AD, are involved in lipid-related terms and pathways. By narrowing down AD-related genes, we identified 49 highly reliable AD-associated genes. The most significant gene, DCTN2, exhibited a fold change that positively correlated with cognitive function and negatively correlated with blood-based biomarkers (pTau217, amyloid beta 42/40 ratio), aligning with the amyloid/Tau/neurodegeneration research criteria for AD. Additionally, the knockdown of DCTN2 in glial cell lines resulted in increased cell toxicity and apoptosis. Identifying differentially responsive genes in ex vivo experiments not only provides insights into the pathology of AD but also offers potential biomarkers for disease diagnosis.",Psychiatry investigation,2025,Yeojin Kim; You Jin Nam; Sunwoo Yoon; Young Joon Cho; Ho Min Song; Seongmin Kim; Donghyuk Shin; Jin Young Noh; Sun Min Lee; So Young Moon; Eun-Joo Kim; Soo Hyun Cho; Byeong C Kim; Seong Hye Choi; Sang Won Seo; Jin Wook Choi; Young-Sil An; Bumhee Park; Young Joon Park; Hee Young Kang; Hyun Goo Woo; Yong Hyuk Cho; Sunhwa Hong; Sang Joon Son; Sang-Rae Lee; Chang Hyung Hong; Hyun Woong Roh
40566889,"Post-Infection Insomnia, Dysfunctional Beliefs About Sleep, and Depression in the COVID-19-Infected General Population.","This study aimed to explore the feasibility of the cognitive-behavioral model of COVID-19-related hypochondriasis among participants infected with the virus, with specific consideration of insomnia severity. Additionally, factors predicting post-infection insomnia were examined in participants without pre-existing sleep disturbances pre-COVID-19 infection. An online study was conducted involving the general population infected with COVID-19. Data were collected on COVID-19 and participants' psychiatric and sleep disorder histories. Self-rating scales utilized included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Obsession with COVID-19 Scale (OCS), Coronavirus Reassurance-Seeking Behaviors Scale (CRBS), Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemic-6 items (SAVE-6), Patient Health Questionnaire-2 items (PHQ-2), and Dysfunctional Beliefs about Sleep-2 items (DBS-2). Among the 260 participants infected with COVID-19, mediation analysis revealed that SAVE-6 had a direct influence on OCS, while CRBS mediated this effect. Furthermore, a separate mediation model demonstrated that the impact of ISI on OCS was mediated by CRBS, PHQ-2, and SAVE-6. Logistic regression analysis conducted on 211 participants without prior sleep disturbances indicated that past psychiatric history, DBS-2, and PHQ-2 served as predictive factors for post-COVID sleep disorders. This study established a feasible hypochondriasis model, demonstrating the influence of insomnia on preoccupation with COVID-19, mediated by reassurance-seeking behavior, depression, and viral anxiety. Moreover, a history of psychiatric disorders, depression, and dysfunctional beliefs about sleep significantly contributed to the emergence of post-COVID sleep disorders.",Psychiatry investigation,2025,Jaeeun Song; Seockhoon Chung
40566888,"Insecure Attachment, Temperament, and Character Traits Associated With Cognitive Disengagement Syndrome and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Symptoms in Children.","Based on the view that cognitive disengagement syndrome (CDS) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are distinct clinical conditions, we aimed to investigate differences between CDS and ADHD symptoms in terms of insecure attachment, temperament, and character traits in children. We assessed 80 children with ADHD (24 girls and 56 boys, aged 9-12 years) through Turgay's DSM-IV Based ADHD and Disruptive Behavior Disorders Screening Scale, Barkley Child Attention Scale, Kerns Security Scale, and the Junior Temperament and Character Inventory. Exclusion criteria included the presence of other psychiatric disorders or neurological diseases. CDS was significantly correlated with age (r=0.280, p=0.012), ADHD-inattention (r=0.435, p<0.001), harm avoidance (HA) (r=0.302, p=0.006), and insecure attachment (r=-0.280, p=0.012). Hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated that age (beta=1.459, p=0.031), ADHD-inattention (beta=0.528, p=0.001), and HA (beta=0.306, p=0.044) were significant predictors of CDS severity. ADHD-inattention was significantly associated with delayed speech onset (r=-0.252, p=0.024), CDS (r=0.435, p<0.001), and novelty seeking (r=0.250, p=0.025), whereas ADHD-hyperactivity/impulsivity had an inversely significant correlation with self-directedness (r=-0.233, p=0.038). Only CDS significantly predicted the severity of ADHD-inattention (beta=0.252, p<0.001). Our findings may suggest that examining CDS and ADHD in terms of attachment styles, temperament and character traits may improve our understanding of the distinctions between these two constructs.",Psychiatry investigation,2025,Hasan Can Özbay; Doğa Sevinçok; Muhammed Mutlu Özbek; Hatice Aksu

This study aimed to investigate the associations between childhood trauma, the BIS/BAS, and mood disorders. This study included 1,026 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD, n=338), bipolar I disorder (BD-I, n=152), bipolar II disorder (BD-II, n=536), and 734 comparisons. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ) and BIS/BAS scale were used for evaluation. Differences in the CTQ and BIS/BAS scores among the patient and comparison groups were examined. Patients in the BD-II group had significantly higher total BIS scores than those in the comparison, MDD, and BD-I groups. Patients with BD-I had significantly higher total BAS scores than those with MDD. The CTQ and total BIS scores were positively correlated, and the total BIS scores showed a significant correlation with emotional neglect and emotional abuse subscale scores. In contrast, no correlation was observed between the CTQ and total BAS scores or between MDD and the total BIS/BAS scores. Differences in childhood trauma and behavioral patterns were observed based on mood disorders. Hence, this study provides valuable insights for future studies on how childhood trauma affects the BIS/BAS in various mental disorders.",Psychiatry investigation,2025,Yoonjeong Jang; Sarah Soonji Kwon; Hyeona Yu; Daseul Lee; Joohyun Yoon; Chan Woo Lee; Yun Seong Park; Hyun A Ryoo; Yejin Park; Hyuk Joon Lee; Yeong Chan Lee; Hong-Hee Won; Tae Hyon Ha; Woojae Myung
40566886,Comparative Analysis of Violent Crime Statistics in Korea by Mental Illness Status (2012-2022): Implications of Deinstitutionalization.,"This study examines violent crime trends in South Korea from 2012 to 2022, comparing offenders with and without mental illness. It evaluates the impact of the 2017 amendments to the Mental Health and Welfare Act, which made involuntary psychiatric hospitalization more difficult, on violent crime rates among individuals with mental illness. We analyzed the annual number of violent crime offenders without and with mental illness (psychosis, mental retardation, or other mental disorders) between 2012 and 2022, as provided by the National Police Agency statistics. We compared the total number of offenders between the two groups before and after 2017 when the Mental Health and Welfare Act was implemented. Significant differences in crime trends were found between the groups. Serious violent crimes, such as murder and attempted murder, decreased in both groups. However, robbery rates fell sharply among offenders without mental illness but declined minimally among those with mental illness, increasing their proportional involvement. Arson rates rose significantly post-2017 among offenders with mental illness. While assault and battery decreased in offenders without mental illness, they slightly increased in those with mental illness. Crimes such as threats, vandalism, and confinement also showed more substantial increases among the mentally ill group. Over the past decade, the number and proportion of violent crimes committed by individuals with mental illness have increased relative to those without, suggesting potential unintended consequences of deinstitutionalization. This highlights the need for comprehensive mental health strategies, including more substantial community-based support.",Psychiatry investigation,2025,Cheol Park; Ju-Yeon Lee; Jae-Min Kim; Il-Seon Shin; Seunghyong Ryu; Sung-Wan Kim
40566860,Correlation of Positive Signs of Functional Neurological Disorder With Headache Severity: A Prospective Cross-Sectional Study.,"Positive signs are clinical signs that are not explained by a structural neurological lesion and are considered the hallmark of functional neurological disorder (FND). In the literature and in clinical experience, positive signs are observed among patients without FND. The aim of the study was to examine the significance of positive signs among headache patients. The authors of this prospective study recruited patients in headache consultation at the University Hospital Inselspital, Bern, Switzerland. Inclusion criteria were headache or facial pain in the past 3 months and age ≥18 years. The exclusion criterion was a known diagnosis of FND. All patients were examined for 14 validated positive signs: give-way weakness, co-contraction, sternocleidomastoid sign, trapezius elevation test, head flexion test, drift without pronation, Hoover I and II, spinal injury test, arm drop test, lip-pulling sign, midline splitting, splitting of vibration sign at the front, and expressive behavior sign. In total, 101 patients were recruited (69% female; mean±SD age=40.8±16.3 years), of whom 43% showed positive signs. Splitting of vibration was the most common sign (27%); the other signs were less frequent (≤10%). Patients with positive signs were older than patients without such signs and had more monthly headache days and exacerbations as well as more intense headache at examination. Multivariable logistic regression revealed a significant association between positive signs and exacerbation days per month (OR=1.08, 95% CI=1.01-1.14, per exacerbation day; p=0.019). Positive signs are frequent among headache patients and point toward a more severe headache condition. This finding suggests overlapping mechanisms in headache and FND.",The Journal of neuropsychiatry and clinical neurosciences,2025,Eric Morel; Antonia Klein; Adrian Scutelnic; Janine Bühler; Selma Aybek; Christoph Schankin
40566853,The Role of Cannabis Policies and Perceptions of Penalties on the Association Between Adolescent Social Bonds and Cannabis Use.,"Recent shifts in cannabis policies have led to lowered risk perceptions, less disapproval of use, and an increase in use among adolescents. This increase in usage is problematic as heavy cannabis use during adolescence can hinder brain development and increase the likelihood of mental health disorders. As such, it is crucial to understand the factors safeguarding adolescents from cannabis use. Research suggests that social bonds and legal consequences may be protective factors against adolescent cannabis use. However, it remains uncertain whether increased accessibility of cannabis undermines the effectiveness of these protective factors. The current study uses data from the 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health to investigate the impact of state-level medical cannabis policies and perceptions of state-level cannabis possession penalties on past year cannabis use, as well as whether these variables moderate the association between social bonds (attachment, commitment, involvement) and past year cannabis use among adolescents. The results indicate that medical cannabis policies are positively and significantly associated with past year cannabis use, while perception of serious criminal justice penalties for cannabis possession is negatively and significantly associated with past year cannabis use. Additionally, the effects of attachment and involvement differ by medical cannabis policy status, but there was no evidence that perception of penalties moderated the association between social bonds and cannabis use. The results of the current study reveal a need for more education among adolescents on both the health consequences and criminal penalties for cannabis use.",Substance use & misuse,2025,Kelsi Moscrop-Blake; Wanda E Leal
40566835,Bridging perspectives: The value of collaboration between Traditional Healing Practitioners and Medical Doctors in dementia research and care in South Africa.,"Traditional Healing Practitioners (THPs) provide care to the majority of the population in South Africa. Despite their widespread presence, they remain largely excluded from dementia research and policy. This reinforces healthcare inequities and overlooks the realities of communities where THPs provide care. This paper explores the role of THPs in dementia care by examining literature in South Africa. It identifies key barriers to collaboration between THPs and medical doctors and discusses pathways for integration. Barriers include epistemological historical marginalization, mutual distrust, fragmented care pathways, and language barriers. These challenges hinder knowledge exchange and joint dementia care strategies. Strengthening relationships through structured engagement, bidirectional knowledge exchange, and ethical collaboration could bridge the gap between THPs and Medical Doctors (MDs). A pluralistic, integrated model valuing both systems could lead to more equitable and effective dementia care. The majority of people in South Africa engage with Traditional Healing Practitioners (THPs) as part of their healthcare, yet THPs remain largely excluded from dementia research and policy. Barriers to collaboration between THPs and Medical Doctors (MDs) include historical marginalization, mutual distrust, fragmented care pathways, and language differences. Integrating THPs and MDs through structured engagement, bidirectional knowledge exchange, and ethical collaboration could enhance dementia care. Shifting away from the binary opposition of Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) and biomedical approaches toward a more integrated and collaborative model of dementia care could lead to more equitable and effective healthcare.

40566828,"Comparative Risk of Developing Interstitial Cystitis With Childhood Gastrointestinal, Urological, Autoimmune, or Psychiatric Disorders.","Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a chronic urological condition associated with significant discomfort, posing diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Although its etiology remains unclear, early-life conditions such as gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, urological anomalies (UA), psychiatric disorders (PD), and autoimmune diseases (AD) have been hypothesized as potential risk factors for developing IC in adulthood. This study aims to investigate these associations by conducting a retrospective cohort analysis utilizing data from the TriNetX US Collaborative Network, encompassing over 118 million patient records. The study and control groups were established across four categories of childhood disorders, with IC incidence monitored over a 14-year period. Statistical methodologies, including propensity score matching and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, were employed to compare outcomes between cohorts. Findings indicate that childhood GI and UA conditions significantly elevate the risk of IC in adulthood, with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and urinary tract infections (UTIs) exhibiting risk ratios of 2.9 and 3.2, respectively. Gender disparities were also noted, with females exhibiting higher incidences of diseases included, particularly UA and AD during adolescence. Additionally, individuals with these early-life conditions demonstrated a higher prevalence of comorbidities, underscoring the complex interplay of health factors contributing to IC pathogenesis. These findings suggest that childhood GI and UA conditions may serve as predictive markers for IC, emphasizing the need for targeted early interventions and preventative care strategies. By identifying at-risk populations, this study provides valuable insights into early detection and management approaches, potentially mitigating the long-term burden of IC on affected individuals. This paper includes an observational retrospective study.

40566826,Plasma NfL and GFAP for predicting VCI and related brain changes in community and clinical cohorts.,"We investigated the usefulness of plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) for capturing vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) in the context of amyloidosis. Using two independent cohorts (n = 1810), we assessed the relationship of plasma NfL and GFAP with (1) vascular brain indices; (2) diagnostic states using the following definitions: vascular versus not (white matter hyperintensity/total intracranial volume ≥ 1.3%), and cognitively impaired (CI) versus cognitively unimpaired (CU) using Clinical Dementia Rating ([CDR] scale ≥ 0.5); and (3) their upstream predictors using structural equation models (SEMs). Plasma NfL and GFAP were associated with vascular brain damage and differed across states (VCI > vascular CU > non-vascular CI > non-vascular CU). In a population-based sample, these biomarkers distinguished vascular CU and VCI from non-vascular CU groups with greater separation in amyloid negative participants. Pathway analyses showed NfL was primarily influenced by systemic/brain vascular health, whereas amyloid contributed to GFAP variability. Plasma biomarkers, particularly NfL, capture vascular brain changes and show promise for VCI identification. Plasma NfL and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were associated with vascular brain indices. Plasma biomarkers differed across diagnostic states (VCI > vascular CU > non-vascular CI > non-vascular CU). Plasma markers discriminated vascular from non-vascular states with greater separation in Aβ- participants. NfL was linked to vascular health, while amyloid influenced GFAP variability in the population-based sample. Future longitudinal frameworks should consider systemic inflammation markers along with these plasma markers to better understand VCID-related brain changes and cognitive decline.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,2025,Sheelakumari Raghavan; Jonathan Graff-Radford; Ekaterina Hofrenning; Angela J Fought; Robert I Reid; Michael G Kamykowski; Alicia Algeciras-Schimnich; B Gwen Windham; David S Knopman; Val J Lowe; Clifford R Jack; Ronald C Petersen; Prashanthi Vemuri

40566800,Biomarker changes associated with fornix deep brain stimulation in Alzheimer's disease.,"Deep brain stimulation of the fornix (fx-DBS) is being investigated for treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The therapy aims at alleviating memory and cognitive circuit dysfunction. In preclinical models of AD, electrical stimulation of the memory circuit has demonstrated a possible disease-modifying potential. Here we examined changes resulting from fx-DBS in hippocampal atrophy and amyloid accumulation in AD patients with fx-DBS. Repeated magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) images acquired over the course of 12 months were used to assess changes in hippocampal volume in 36 ADvance trial patients compared to 40 matched untreated AD patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, and in 10 separate patients with repeated flutemetamol PET and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers. We observed a reduction of hippocampal atrophy and amyloid beta (Aβ) PET binding, and an increase in the CSF Aβ/total-tau ratio in DBS patients. These findings highlight the potential of fornix deep brain stimulation to modify AD biomarkers and possibly progression in some patients. Fornix deep brain stimulation (fx-DBS) is being investigated to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). Results show that fx-DBS modifies imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers.

40566796,Effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in early Alzheimer's disease: A randomized controlled trial.,"Due to its metabolic effects, dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, holds potential as an Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutic. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 12-week single-site study to investigate the effect of dapagliflozin in participants with probable AD (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score 15-26). We planned to enroll 48 participants with 2:1 randomization to 10 mg dapagliflozin once daily (n = 32) versus matching placebo (n = 16). The primary objective was the effect of dapagliflozin on cerebral N-acetylaspartate (NAA). We also assessed safety, glycemic control, body composition, brain metabolism, and cognition. There was no change in the primary outcome. There were no significant adverse event differences. Hemoglobin A1c, fat mass, and fat-free lean mass decreased; brain glutathione increased; and Stroop Interference test (but not other cognitive test) performance improved. Treated participants manifested metabolic effects observed in clinical studies of other cohorts. In AD, dapagliflozin use may affect the brain. Dapagliflozin did not alter magnetic resonance spectroscopy N-acetylaspartate (primary outcome) in this exploratory Alzheimer's disease (AD) trial. Dapagliflozin-induced glucose disposal is sufficient to alter systemic metabolism.

40566790,Associations between objective sleep metrics and brain structure in cognitively unimpaired adults: interactions with sex and Alzheimer's biomarkers.,"Sleep disturbances are prevalent in Alzheimer's disease (AD), probably emerging during its preclinical stage. Poor subjective sleep quality is linked to reduced brain volume and cortical thickness (CTh), but associations with objective sleep measures, particularly regarding sex and AD pathology, remain unclear. We characterized 171 cognitively unimpaired adults from the ALzheimer and FAmilies (ALFA) Sleep study using actigraphy, MRI, amyloid beta 42/40, and phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 in cerebrospinal fluid. Lower sleep efficiency, higher wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep fragmentation were associated with lower CTh in the medial temporal lobe and other regions linked with AD and sleep disruption, even after adjusting for AD biomarkers. Sex and AD biomarkers modified these associations, with longer WASO showing a stronger correlation with lower CTh in females. Disrupted sleep may reduce cortical integrity independently of AD biomarkers, suggesting alternative pathways. Females appear more vulnerable to impaired sleep, and AD pathology may exacerbate AD-related changes in CTh. Poor sleep efficiency, increased WASO, and sleep fragmentation are associated with reduced CTh in regions vulnerable to early AD, independently of amyloid and tau pathology. In the presence of AD pathology, this relationship is altered, with A+T+ individuals exhibiting increased CTh associated with sleep disruption. Sex-specific effects suggest females are more vulnerable to sleep-related cortical thinning. These findings highlight the potential of targeting sleep as a secondary prevention strategy to preserve brain integrity and mitigate neurodegenerative processes in AD-vulnerable regions.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,2025,Laura Stankeviciute; Núria Tort-Colet; Ana Fernández-Arcos; Gonzalo Sánchez-Benavides; Carolina Minguillón; Karine Fauria; Sebastian Camillo Holst; Pilar Garcés; Thomas Mueggler; Henrik Zetterberg; Kaj Blennow; Álex Iranzo; Marc Suárez-Calvet; Juan Domingo Gispert; José Luis Molinuevo; Oriol Grau-Rivera
40566787,[The research progress on the improvement effect of repeated peripheral magnetic stimulation on upper limb and lower limb spasm after stroke].,"Post-stroke spasticity, a common sequelae of upper motor neuron lesions, results in motor control deficits and pathological hypertonia that not only reduce patients' activities of daily living but may also cause impairment of adaptive neuroplasticity. Repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (rPMS), as a novel non-invasive neuromodulation technique, demonstrates unique clinical potential through targeted modulation of electromagnetic coupling effects in the peripheral neuromuscular system. Although current international studies have validated the therapeutic potential of rPMS for spasticity, significant heterogeneity persists in elucidating its mechanisms of action, optimizing parameter protocols, and standardizing outcome assessment systems. This review innovatively synthesized recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and mechanistic evidence, systematically summarizing rPMS-mediated multidimensional intervention paradigms for upper- and lower-limb spasticity. It rigorously examined the correlations between stimulation frequency parameters (low-frequency <i>vs.</i> high-frequency), anatomical targeting (nerve trunk <i>vs</i>. motor point), and clinical outcomes including spasticity severity, motor function, and quality of life. Crucially, the analysis reveals that rPMS may ameliorate spasticity after stroke through dual mechanisms involving local neuroelectrophysiological modulation and central sensorimotor network reorganization, thereby providing a theoretical foundation for developing individualized rPMS clinical protocols and establishing precision treatment strategies.",Sheng wu yi xue gong cheng xue za zhi = Journal of biomedical engineering = Shengwu yixue gongchengxue zazhi,2025,Lijuan Xu; Liang Ye; Jie Jia; Shugeng Chen

Eight ASD participants were selected to undergo four months of Guzheng playing training, with one month as a training cycle. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and behavioral data were collected for comparative analysis. The results showed that after Guzheng playing training, the relative power of the alpha band in the occipital lobe of ASD children increased, and the relative power of the theta band in the parietal lobe decreased. The differences compared with typically developing (TD) children were narrowed. Moreover, some channels exhibited a gradual increase or decrease in power with the extended training period. Meanwhile, the sample entropy parameter also showed a similar upward trend, which was consistent with the behavioral data representation. The study shows that Guzheng training can enhance the brain function of ASD patients, with better effects from longer training.

40566769,[Research progress on brain mechanism of brain-computer interface technology in the upper limb motor function rehabilitation in stroke patients].,"Stroke causes abnormality of brain physiological function and limb motor function. Brain-computer interface (BCI) connects the patient's active consciousness to an external device, so as to enhance limb motor function. Previous studies have preliminarily confirmed the efficacy of BCI rehabilitation training in improving upper limb motor function after stroke, but the brain mechanism behind it is still unclear. This paper aims to review on the brain mechanism of upper limb motor dysfunction in stroke patients and the improvement of brain function in those receiving BCI training, aiming to further explore the brain mechanism of BCI in promoting the rehabilitation of upper limb motor function after stroke. The results of this study show that in the fields of imaging and electrophysiology, abnormal activity and connectivity have been found in stroke patients. And BCI training for stroke patients can improve their upper limb motor function by increasing the activity and connectivity of one hemisphere of the brain and restoring the balance between the bilateral hemispheres of the brain. This article summarizes the brain mechanism of BCI in promoting the rehabilitation of upper limb motor function in stroke in both imaging and electrophysiology, and provides a reference for the clinical application and scientific research of BCI in stroke rehabilitation in the future.",Sheng wu yi xue gong cheng xue za zhi = Journal of biomedical engineering = Shengwu yixue gongchengxue zazhi,2025,Hebi Wu; Shugeng Chen; Jie Jia
40566765,[Detection of motor intention in patients with consciousness disorder based on electroencephalogram and functional near infrared spectroscopy combined with motor brain-computer interface paradigm].,"Clinical grading diagnosis of disorder of consciousness (DOC) patients relies on behavioral assessment, which has certain limitations. Combining multi-modal technologies and brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigms can assist in identifying patients with minimally conscious state (MCS) and vegetative state (VS). This study collected electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals under motor BCI paradigms from 14 DOC patients, who were divided into two groups based on clinical scores: 7 in the MCS group and 7 in the VS group. We calculated event-related desynchronization (ERD) and motor decoding accuracy to analyze the effectiveness of motor BCI paradigms in detecting consciousness states. The results showed that the classification accuracies for left-hand and right-hand movement tasks using EEG were 93.28% and 76.19% for the MCS and VS groups, respectively; the classification precisions using fNIRS were 53.72% and 49.11% for these groups. When combining EEG and fNIRS features, the classification accuracies for left-hand and right-hand movement tasks in the MCS and VS groups were 95.56% and 87.38%, respectively. Although there was no statistically significant difference in motor decoding accuracy between the two groups, significant differences in ERD were observed between different consciousness states during left-hand movement tasks ( <i>P</i> < 0.001). This study demonstrates that motor BCI paradigms can assist in assessing the level of consciousness, with EEG being more sensitive for evaluating residual motor intention intensity. Moreover, the ERD feature of motor intention intensity is more sensitive than BCI classification accuracy.",Sheng wu yi xue gong cheng xue za zhi = Journal of biomedical engineering = Shengwu yixue gongchengxue zazhi,2025,Xiaoke Chai; Nan Wang; Jiuxiang Song; Yi Yang
40566764,[Brain-computer interface technology and its applications for patients with disorders of consciousness].,"With the continuous advancement of neuroimaging technologies, clinical research has discovered the phenomenon of cognitive-motor dissociation in patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC). This groundbreaking finding has provided new impetus for the development and application of brain-computer interface (BCI) in clinic. Currently, BCI has been widely applied in DoC patients as an important tool for assessing and assisting behaviorally unresponsive individuals. This paper reviews the current applications of BCI in DoC patients, focusing four main aspects including consciousness detection, auxiliary diagnosis, prognosis assessment, and rehabilitation treatment. It also provides an in-depth analysis of representative key techniques and experimental outcomes in each aspect, which include BCI paradigm designs, brain signal decoding method, and feedback mechanisms. Furthermore, the paper offers recommendations for BCI design tailored to DoC patients and discusses future directions for research and clinical practice in this field.",Sheng wu yi xue gong cheng xue za zhi = Journal of biomedical engineering = Shengwu yixue gongchengxue zazhi,2025,Jiahui Pan; Zhihang Zhang; Yuanlin Zhang; Fei Wang; Jun Xiao
40566759,"Clinical features, biomarker profiles, and neuroimaging characteristics in patients from memory clinic in china: The Shanghai Memory Study.","Despite advances in biomarker assessment, molecular neuroimaging, and disease-modifying therapies for cognitive disorders, China lacks well-characterized clinical cohorts integrating comprehensive clinical assessments and multimodal biomarkers. The Shanghai Memory Study (SMS), an ongoing hospital-based cohort, enrolled participants undergoing clinical/neuropsychological assessments, genotyping, multimodal imaging, and biospecimen collection. From 2012 to 2024, 2001 participants were enrolled: 115 cognitively unimpaired (CU), 938 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 948 with dementia. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed A+/T+ positivity rates of 15.8% in CU, 51.2% in MCI, and 100% in Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD). Plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181) level increased gradually across the AD continuum. Blood p-tau181 and 18F-Florzolotau PET showed comparable utility for amyloid status identification. In a subcohort of 251 amnestic MCI (aMCI) patients, low Aβ42/Aβ40 and elevated p-tau181 predicted 4.7-year ADD risk. By offering an integrated framework, SMS will facilitate the exploration of AD pathogenesis and the understanding of cognitive disorders. The SMS is an ongoing prospective cohort study based on a memory clinic in China. The SMS has established a relatively large-scale dataset that includes clinical data, biofluid markers, MRI and PET imaging, and novel biomarkers.

This qualitative descriptive study explored the unmet needs and related barriers that drive avoidable NH placements among Black, Hispanic/Latino, and White persons living with dementia (PLWD). Interviews were conducted with PLWD, family care partners, and NH staff, from two New York NHs along with aging policy experts. Seven distinct themes specific to unmet needs emerged from interviews including (1) assistance with activities of daily living and basic home maintenance; (2) resources and services; (3) treatment-related services; (4) socialization; (5) individual preferences; (6) function of the home (e.g., unaddressed home modification needs); and (7) equipped, available, and supported family. Barriers contributing to unmet needs included awareness, knowledge, availability, affordability, and acceptability of resources, services, and supports. Strategies to address these unmet needs and improve community-based services may help reduce these NH placements. Many people living with dementia can remain at home with necessary supports. There is limited paid and unpaid assistance to support people living with dementia.

40566719,[Research progress on calcium activities in astrocyte microdomains].,"Astrocytes are a crucial type of glial cells in the central nervous system, not only maintaining brain homeostasis, but also actively participating in the transmission of information within the brain. Astrocytes have a complex structure that includes the soma, various levels of processes, and end-feet. With the advancement of genetically encoded calcium indicators and imaging technologies, researchers have discovered numerous localized and small calcium activities in the fine processes and end-feet. These calcium activities were termed as microdomain calcium activities, which significantly differ from the calcium activities in the soma and can influence the activity of local neurons, synapses, and blood vessels. This article elaborates the detection and analysis, characteristics, sources, and functions of microdomain calcium activities, and discusses the impact of aging and neurodegenerative diseases on these activities, aiming to enhance the understanding of the role of astrocytes in the brain and to provide new insights for the treatment of brain disorders.",Sheng li xue bao : [Acta physiologica Sinica],2025,Fu-Sheng Ding; Si-Si Yang; Liang Zheng; Dan Mu; Zhu Huang; Jian-Xiong Zhang
40566718,[Mechanisms of mitochondrial dynamics in ischemic stroke and therapeutic strategies].,"As a common neurological disease in China, stroke has an extremely high rate of death and disability, of which 80% is ischemic stroke (IS), causing a serious burden to individuals and society. Neuronal death is an important factor in the pathogenesis of stroke. Studies have shown that mitochondrial dynamics, as a key mechanism regulating intracellular energy metabolism and cell death, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of IS. In recent years, targeting mitochondrial dynamics has become an emerging therapeutic tool to improve neurological impairment after stroke. This paper reviews the research advance in recent years in IS mitochondrial dynamics, summarizing and discussing the overview of mitochondrial dynamics, the role of mitochondrial dynamics in IS, and the studies on mitochondrial dynamics-based treatment of IS. This paper helps to explore the mechanism of the role of mitochondrial dynamics in IS and effective interventions, and provides a theoretical strategy for targeting mitochondrial dynamics to treat IS in the clinic.",Sheng li xue bao : [Acta physiologica Sinica],2025,Xin-Yue Zheng; Ming Zhang; Kai-Qi Su; Zhi-Min Ding
40566709,[Exercise preconditioning alleviates motor deficits in MPTP-induced Parkinsonian mice by improving mitochondrial function].,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder mainly related to mitochondrial dysfunction of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain substantia nigra. This study aimed to investigate the effects of exercise preconditioning on motor deficits and mitochondrial function in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model. Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into four groups: sedentary + saline (SS), sedentary + MPTP (SM), exercise + saline (ES), and exercise + MPTP (EM) groups. Mice in the ES and EM groups received 4 weeks of treadmill training, and then SM and EM groups were treated with MPTP for 5 days. Motor function was assessed by behavioral tests, and morphological and functional changes in dopaminergic neurons and mitochondria in the substantia nigra of the midbrain were evaluated using immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and transmission electron microscopy technology. The results showed that, compared with the SM group, the EM group exhibited significantly improved motor ability, up-regulated protein expression levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) in the midbrain, and down-regulated protein expression of α-synuclein (α-Syn) in the mitochondria of substantia nigra. Compared with the SM group, the EM group showed up-regulated protein expression levels of mitochondrial fusion proteins, including optical atrophy protein 1 (OPA1) and mitofusin 2 (MFN2), and biogenesis-related proteins, including peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), while the protein expression levels of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) and mitochondrial fission protein 1 (FIS1) were significantly down-regulated. Compared with the SM group, the EM group showed significantly reduced damage to substantia nigra mitochondria, restored mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production, and decreased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These results suggest that 4-week treadmill pre-training can alleviate MPTP-induced motor impairments in PD mice by improving mitochondrial function, providing a theoretical basis for early exercise-based prevention of PD.",Sheng li xue bao : [Acta physiologica Sinica],2025,Miao-Miao Xu; Dan-Ting Hu; Qiao Zhang; Xiao-Guang Liu; Zhao-Wei Li; Li-Ming Lu
40566700,A Pragmatic Approach to Sexual Health in Movement Disorders.,"A satisfying sexual life is essential for maintaining good quality of life and healthy relationships for all individuals, including those with movement disorders and their partners. However, its significance is often overlooked in neurological clinics. We review the literature and draw from our own experience to offer a practical approach for assessing and managing sexual health issues in patients with movement disorders. We begin by introducing fundamental concepts of sexual medicine, emphasizing models of sexual response that offer useful frameworks for diagnostic classification and management practices. We then address the most common sexual problems and disorders, including sexual dysfunction, sexual pain disorders, sexual compulsivity, and paraphilic behaviors, and their connections to different movement disorders. Next, we discuss assessment approaches that encompass biological, psychological, and social factors related to sexual health, including investigations for structural, vascular, or hormonal causes. Brief assessment questionnaires are also discussed. In addition to specific sexual therapeutic practices and supportive psychotherapy, we cover adjustments to pharmacological treatments related to movement disorders, as well as the use of mechanical devices. We also address the need for individualized management in specific cases, such as for patients undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery. Neurologists can play a key role in addressing sexual health concerns, considering the impact of both the disorder and its treatments. A comprehensive approach includes assessing biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors, with interventions like sexual therapy, supportive psychotherapy, pharmacological treatments and medical devices. Further research is needed to establish evidence-based treatments in this population.",Movement disorders clinical practice,2025,Justus Chun-Yu Chen; Renato P Munhoz; Anthony E Lang; Peer Briken; Christos Ganos
40566678,Voltage Gating and 4-aminopyridine Inhibition in Shaker Kv Channel Revealed by Closed-State Model.,"The generation and propagation of action potentials in neurons relies on the coordinated activation of voltage-dependent sodium and potassium channels. The Kv1 (Shaker) family of potassium channels drives the repolarization phase of the action potential by opening and closing their pore, a process controlled by a voltage sensor domain. However, a molecular description of how the voltage sensor domain drives pore gating has been constrained by a lack of closed-state structures. Here, we present a structural model of the closed Shaker channel that reveals the structural basis of voltage gating. Using AlphaFold2-based conformational sampling, we identified a partially activated state of the voltage sensor which, when modeled with the full channel, produced a closed state. Based on this model we demonstrate that breaking a backbone hydrogen bond between the S4-S5 linker and S5 helices is a critical part of the activation pathway. Docking studies revealed a hydrophobic cavity in the closed pore that binds 4-aminopyridine, a potassium channel inhibitor used to enhance nerve conduction in multiple sclerosis. Our results demonstrate how the voltage sensor movement drives pore opening and provide a structural framework for developing new therapeutic agents targeting the closed state. We anticipate that the novel methods used in this work will allow the characterization of conformational dynamics in voltage-gated ion channels, enabling drug design efforts focused on state-dependent modulation of ion channels for neurological disorders treatment.",Biophysical journal,2025,Bernardo I Pinto-Anwandter
40566654,Components of frontal assessment battery and clinical features in patients with stroke.,"First, to investigate whether the 6 aspects of executive functions assessed by the Frontal Assessment Battery have different components and, if so, to extract those components using principal component analysis. Second, to identify patient groups based on their characteristics using cluster analysis. A cross-sectional study. Seventy-eight patients with stroke. The Frontal Assessment Battery, Mini-Mental State Examination, Trail Making Test, and Stroop Color Word Test were performed within 5 days. Based on principal component analysis, the Frontal Assessment Battery was classified into cognitive control (subscales 1-3, 5) and behavioural control (subscales 4 and 6). Two clusters that reflect these components (cluster 1, n = 68; cluster 2, n = 10) were identified. The between-group comparison showed that compared with cluster 1, cluster 2 had lower scores on Frontal Assessment Battery subscales 4 and 6, the Frontal Assessment Battery total scores, and other executive functions scores. The Mini-Mental State Examination scores had no significant differences. The Frontal Assessment Battery can be classified into 2 components, and the impairment of Frontal Assessment Battery subscales 4 and 6 identified a specific group of patients with stroke with severe executive dysfunction.",Journal of rehabilitation medicine,2025,Katsuya Sakai; Yuichiro Hosoi; Yusuke Harada; Yuichi Kato; Takayuki Miyauchi
40566653,Are the 6-minute walk test and the 2-minute walk test equivalent in acute and subacute stroke survivors in Belgium and Vietnam: a multicultural study.,"To test the equivalence of the 6-minute walk test and the 2-minute walk test in stroke survivors in a multicultural setting, focusing on reliability, performance, and associations with clinical and anthropometric factors. Cross-sectional observational study. 238 participants (119 stroke survivors and 119 healthy individuals matched for age and sex). Participants were assessed using the 6-minute walk test and the 2-minute walk test in Belgium and Vietnam. Stroke survivors were assessed in the acute and subacute phases (17 days post-stroke) and reassessed after 1-3 days. The 6-minute walk test and the 2-minute walk test showed high test-retest reliability (ICC > 0.96). The difference between the two tests was not significant in terms of walking distance reduction in stroke survivors relative to healthy participants (1.4%), not clinically meaningful for walking speed (0.026 m/s), and not significant in chronotropic response (1.6 bpm). The correlation between the 2 tests in stroke survivors was high (r = 0.93) and walking distance was moderately related to height, weight, and phase, and type of stroke (p < 0.05). The 6-minute walk test and the 2-minute walk test exhibited similar results in measuring the impact of stroke on walking performance. The similarity between Belgium and Vietnam further supports the clinical equivalence of both tests among acute and subacute stroke survivors.",Journal of rehabilitation medicine,2025,Duy Thanh Nguyen; Chloé Sauvage; Claire Questienne; Michel Duchène; Duan Van Nguyen; Dung Tan Nguyen; Massimo Penta
40566647,Obstructive Hydrocephalus Caused by Tumefactive Perivascular Spaces: A Case Report.,"BACKGROUND Perivascular spaces (PS), often called Virchow-Robin spaces, are fluid-filled regions surrounding the brain's blood vessels, typically benign and detected incidentally on MRI scans. However, their enlargement, termed tumefactive PS, is rare and poses significant diagnostic challenges, potentially mimicking severe intracranial conditions. Accurate identification is critical, as these expanded spaces can lead to serious clinical outcomes like hydrocephalus or brain herniation. Misinterpretation of imaging can result in incorrect diagnoses and unwarranted procedures. This case report highlights a rare instance where tumefactive PS caused obstructive hydrocephalus, underscoring the necessity for precise diagnosis. CASE REPORT We report a case involving a 66-year-old Hispanic female with a complex medical history, including insulin-dependent diabetes, prior stroke, and post-Whipple's procedure for pancreatic cancer, who was admitted with progressive somnolence. Initial evaluations indicated encephalopathy. Advanced imaging with CT and MRI identified significantly enlarged PS near the third and fourth ventricles, causing obstructive ventriculomegaly. Differential diagnoses considered cystic tumors and infections, yet MRI findings - cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) isointensity and lack of contrast enhancement - confirmed tumefactive PS. A ventriculoatrial shunt was considered, but the patient's condition rapidly worsened due to sepsis and an intraperitoneal abscess, culminating in multi-organ failure and death before surgery. CONCLUSIONS Although rare, tumefactive PS can mimic serious intracranial diseases, necessitating careful MRI evaluation to differentiate these benign spaces from more severe pathologies. Key MRI indicators include alignment with penetrating vessels, absence of enhancement, and CSF signal intensity. Misdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary surgical interventions, emphasizing the importance of accurate imaging interpretation. In symptomatic cases, usually due to mass effect, surgical intervention might be required. Prompt and precise diagnosis is crucial for managing symptomatic tumefactive PS effectively.",The American journal of case reports,2025,Joaquin Ruiz Lopez; Adriana M Perez Torres; Claudia M Muns; Eduardo Labat Alvarez
40566573,Psychiatric Implications of Genetic Variations in Oligodendrocytes: Insights from hiPSC Models.,"Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are a dynamic and heterogeneous population of glial cells essential for brain development and myelination. Beyond their well-established role in oligodendrogenesis, emerging evidence suggests that OPCs contribute to synaptic regulation, neuronal communication, and brain plasticity. Recent studies have increasingly implicated OPC dysfunction in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD). This narrative review integrates clinical, genetic, transcriptomic, and histological findings to examine the role of OPC alterations in mental illnesses. In SCZ, OPC abnormalities predominantly affect myelination, but recent data also suggest deficits in non-canonical functions, including neuron-OPC communication. Findings in BD largely mirror those in SCZ, implying shared OPC-related mechanisms across these disorders. In contrast, OPC involvement in MDD appears more complex, with evidence supporting both myelination deficits and non-canonical dysfunctions, such as impaired neuro-glial interactions and perineuronal network alterations. The developmental timing of OPC dysfunction may represent a common denominator underlying psychiatric disorders, as early-life stress and neurodevelopmental disturbances have been linked to OPC impairments. Moreover, given the shared developmental origins of OPCs and parvalbumin-positive interneurons, disruptions in their mutual interactions may contribute to broader neural network dysregulation. Despite these insights, the field remains in its infancy. Future studies integrating independent human cohorts with robust preclinical models are needed to clarify the extent of OPC involvement in psychiatric pathophysiology. Understanding OPC dysfunction may reveal novel biomarkers and open new avenues for individualized therapeutic interventions and preventive strategies in mental health.","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Martina D'Angelo; Valeria Di Stefano; Ilaria Pullano; Francesco Monaco; Luca Steardo
40566488,The Bidirectional Interplay Between Substances of Abuse and Gut Microbiome Homeostasis.,"Specific gut microorganisms and their metabolic by-products have been identified as key regulators of host physiology, contributing to the modulation of the immune system, inflammatory processes, brain function, and behavior, which highlights the gut microbiome as a potential modulator of the neurobiological mechanisms involved in substance use disorders. This narrative review provides an updated overview of how drugs of abuse influence the composition and dynamics of the human gut microbiome and how bacterial dysbiosis may be a contributing factor to substance use disorders by modulating the communication between the gut and the brain. Thus, by examining commonly abused substances such as alcohol, psychostimulants, opioids, cannabinoids, and nicotine, this review aimed to deepen the understanding of the bidirectional relationship between the gut microbiome and substance use. There is evidence indicating that gut microbiome alterations may influence addiction through changes in gut-brain signaling. Furthermore, changes in the gut microbiome and its metabolites may not only result from substance use disorders, but could also modulate behavioral responses to drugs of abuse. Although the exact mechanisms by which the gut microbiome modulates behavioral responses to drugs of abuse are not fully understood, microbial products such as short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan metabolites, bile acids, and neurotransmitters have been suggested to play a role in this process by influencing the blood-brain barrier permeability, host immune activation, neural signaling, and gene expression. Therefore, manipulating the gut microbiome or its by-products may represent a promising approach for enhancing substance use disorder treatments, identifying individuals at increased risk of pathological drug use, and elucidating its role in substance-related behaviors.","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Alejandro Borrego-Ruiz; Juan J Borrego
40566392,"Nicotine Dependence in a Banned Market: Biomarker Evidence from E-Cigarette Users in São Paulo, Brazil.","Although electronic cigarettes have been banned in Brazil since 2009, their use is increasing, particularly among youth. We conducted a biomarker-based study to profile exclusive e-cigarette users in São Paulo and to examine the associations of e-cigarette use with salivary nicotine and cotinine levels. A population-based, cross-sectional study was conducted between April and September 2024 in six municipalities in São Paulo, Brazil. Randomly selected participants who reported exclusive use of electronic cigarettes completed a questionnaire and provided oral fluid samples for the determination of their nicotine and cotinine concentrations using LC-MS/MS. The cohort consisted of N = 417 participants. Significant associations were found between nicotine and cotinine concentrations and variables such as knowledge of nicotine content and product type. Addiction status significantly influenced the nicotine and cotinine concentrations, as well as smoking history, last consumption, recharge/purchase frequency, and consumption duration (all <i>p</i> < 0.001). Participants who perceived themselves to have a moderate or severe addiction exhibited higher nicotine and cotinine concentrations compared with those who did not perceive that they had an addiction (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Most participants were young, predominantly White, and highly educated and earned higher incomes. The findings reveal a correlation between perceived nicotine dependence and salivary nicotine and cotinine concentrations, underscoring the physiological and behavioral markers of electronic cigarette addiction. High salivary concentrations of nicotine appear to be independent of duration of e-cigarette use, smoking history, and age. These findings underscore the urgent need for surveillance and public health interventions, even in jurisdictions where these products remain illegal.

40566391,Family Members' Help-Seeking Behaviour for Their Relative Who Uses Substances: A Cross-Sectional National Study in Brazil.,"The affected family members (AFM) of relatives with substance use problems (RSU) play an important role in supporting their relatives to enter substance use treatment. This study investigated the help-seeking behaviours for their relatives by AFM in Brazil, including the characteristics of those who sought help and the risk factors for delaying it. A secondary analysis from a national cross-sectional study of 3030 AFM was performed. Participants were recruited from a range of services focused on AFM across each of the five Brazilian regions (North, Northeast, Central-West, Southeast, South). While 92.7% sought help, 66.0% delayed for an average of 37.2 (SD 70.71) months. Help seeking was associated with higher socioeconomic status and being from the Southeastern region. Barriers included the relative refusing help (31.5%) and the belief that help was not needed (20.6%). Longer delays were associated with female AFM, residents in the Central-West region, non-parents, older RSU, alcohol use, and withdrawal coping strategies. The findings show disparities in help-seeking behaviour across socioeconomic groups, regions, and substance types, highlighting the need for better healthcare workforce distribution and targeted interventions to educate AFMs on the importance of engagement with healthcare services.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Cassandra Borges Bortolon; Martha Canfield; Maria de Fatima Rato Padin; Jim Orford; Ronaldo Laranjeira
40566383,Pharmacological and Non-Pharmacological Interventions to Improve Sleep in People with Cognitive Impairment: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Sleep disturbance is common among people with cognitive impairment and, when present, is an important target for intervention because it potentially leads to negative outcomes and cognitive decline. Given this association, sleep represents a potential public health target, although evidence for efficacy is lacking. For this study, a systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken of controlled clinical trials of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to improve sleep in mild cognitive impairment and dementia. A total of 144 trials involving 13,471 participants (median 50 per trial) were included. To measure sleep, 68 trials used subjective measures exclusively, and 41 used only objective measures, while 35 used a combination. In all, 287 discrete sleep outcome measures were reported. Bright light therapy was the most frequently examined non-pharmacological intervention, but results were equivocal. Other non-pharmacological interventions (such as physical activity, cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia, music, and continuous positive airway pressure) showed promise but require further evidence. Results for melatonin, the most frequently examined pharmacological intervention, were inconclusive, but lower doses may be more effective. Other pharmacological interventions (such as trazadone and orexin-receptor antagonists) demonstrated effectiveness in a small number of trials but require further evidence. Overall, there is insufficient evidence upon which to base clinical decisions regarding the treatment of sleep disturbance in this population. Existing research is marked by wide heterogeneity, which limits opportunities for data synthesis. A core outcome set is urgently required to ensure that future research provides more coherent and reliable evidence to improve outcomes for people with cognitive impairment and sleep disturbance.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Patrick Crowley; Mark R O'Donovan; Peter Leahy; Evelyn Flanagan; Rónán O'Caoimh
40566372,Understanding the Parental Caregiving of Children with Cerebral Palsy in Saudi Arabia: Discovering the Untold Story.,"Parents provide most of the support needed for children with cerebral palsy (CP) to increase the child's participation and independence. Understanding the experiences of parents caring for children with CP is essential for developing effective family programs and services. The current knowledge about parents' experiences in CP is based on studies in Western countries, with little known about this phenomenon in Arab countries like Saudi Arabia. This study aimed to understand the unique experiences and support needs of Saudi parents caring for children with CP from a social-ecological perspective. We conducted a qualitative, exploratory, descriptive study involving 12 semi-structured interviews with mothers and fathers of children with different types of CP. We analyzed the data using a reflexive thematic approach, following six distinct phases. Participants' narratives revealed a complex caregiving journey marked by both challenges and rewards. Support from Saudi nuclear and extended family members was considered important; however, many parents expressed a need for additional physical and financial assistance from their families. Parents reported feeling stressed and experiencing challenges in accessing and navigating educational and healthcare services. Our findings highlight that Islamic values play a crucial role in the experiences of Saudi parents. These values foster a sense of collectivism, highlighting the importance of family support and community involvement, which can affect the Saudi caregiving environment. Parents remain an essential yet often invisible part of the Saudi caregiving system. Without adequate support, parents are at risk of experiencing social, financial, academic, physical, and mental health challenges, which may affect their overall family well-being. Future work may need to consider spiritual and gender roles when developing programs or services to support Saudi parents of children with CP.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Ashwaq Alqahtani; Ahmad Sahely; Heather M Aldersey; Marcia Finlayson; Danielle Macdonald; Afolasade Fakolade
40566371,"The Role of Mental Health, Recent Trauma, and Suicidal Behavior in Officer-Involved Shootings: A Public Health Perspective.","This study uses a public health approach to identify the comorbid risk factors and protective factors that influence the likelihood of an officer-involved shooting (OIS). We analyzed 7.5 years of hospital inpatient data obtained from the state of Texas. The OIS subjects (<i>n</i> = 177) were civilians who were shot during a legal intervention involving law enforcement. The control group (<i>n</i> = 33,539) included persons who were hospitalized due to injuries from a car accident. Logistic regression models were used to identify the predictors of an OIS incident. The data included information on chronic diseases, vulnerable population status, health insurance, mental health diagnoses, substance use disorders, and recent trauma. About one-fourth (24.3%) of OIS subjects had a diagnosed mental illness, compared to 8.4% of control subjects (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Factors that greatly increased the risk for an OIS included the following: schizophrenia (AOR = 2.7; CI: 1.6, 4.6), methamphetamine use disorder (AOR = 3.5; CI: 2.2, 5.5), and recent family bereavement (AOR = 8.5; CI: 1.8, 39.6). Six subjects (3.4%) were persons experiencing homelessness (PEH). Protective factors that lowered the risk for an OIS included commercial health insurance (AOR = 0.27; CI: 0.17, 0.45) and Medicaid insurance (AOR = 0.61; CI: 0.11, 0.93). These findings underscore the preventable nature of many OIS incidents, especially those that involve untreated mental illness, homelessness, substance use disorders, and recent trauma. Addressing the root causes of these incidents will likely require interdisciplinary collaboration among law enforcement, public health agencies, and social services.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Liam O'Neill

However, routine clinical adoption is not spontaneous. Implementation science facilitates stakeholder engagement and the assessment of needs and plans. The study aims to assess the needs related to audiology and speech-language pathology services for children under six years of age and readiness for a tele-practice-based model of care for diagnostic and rehabilitation services among parents within the public sector in Tamil Nadu. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study design was used. The qualitative methods of focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews were conducted for parents of children with disabilities. A quantitative community survey was conducted on parents of children with no known disabilities. A deductive-inductive method of analysis was used. <b>Results:</b> Community survey responses were analyzed using percentage analysis. The results were classified based on the constructs of Bowen's feasibility framework: demand/need for tele-practice, acceptability of tele-practice, and integration and practicality of tele-practice. Parents considered the existing services to be inadequate. Parents perceived tele-practice as beneficial, yet they felt a hybrid method would be more suitable, with sufficiently interspersed in-person visits. Parents believed that training and community awareness were necessary before implementing a technology-based model of services. <b>Conclusions:</b> The study's findings guided the fine-tuning of the proposed comprehensive tele-practice model for hearing and speech-language services for children in this rural district.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Neethi Jesudass; Vidya Ramkumar; Shuba Kumar; Lakshmi Venkatesh
40566359,Trends in Malignant and Benign Brain Tumor Incidence and Mobile Phone Use in the U.S. (2000-2021): A SEER-Based Study.,"(1) Background: There has been an ongoing concern for several decades that radiofrequencies emitted from mobile phones are related to brain cancer risk. We calculated temporal trends in brain cancer incidence rates in adults and children and compared them to mobile phone subscription data over the same time period. (2) Methods: We analyzed the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER 22) cancer database between 2000 and 2021. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) per 100,000 people were calculated and the annual percentage change (APC) for malignant and benign brain cancer and vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuromas of the 8th cranial nerve) was established. The total number of mobile phone subscriptions in the United States was plotted for the period 1985-2024. (3) Results: The APC for adolescents and adults was -0.6 (<i>p</i> = 0.0004) for malignant tumors, -0.06 (<i>p</i> = 0.551) for temporal lobe tumors, and 1.9 (<i>p</i> = 0.00003) for benign tumors. The APC for benign acoustic neuroma was 0.09 (<i>p</i> = 0.8237), suggesting that mobile phone use is unlikely to be associated with this tumor type. There was a 1200-fold increase in the number of cell phone subscriptions during this period. (4) Conclusions: These findings suggest that mobile phone use does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of brain cancer, either malignant or benign.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Li Zhang; Joshua E Muscat
40566358,Internalizing and Externalizing Behaviors: A Cross-Cultural Study in Colombian and Mexican Adolescents with Eating Disorders.,"In Colombia and Mexico, an increase in emotional, behavioral, and eating problems in adolescents has been documented after the pandemic. The objective was to characterize the relationship between internalizing and externalizing behaviors in adolescents with eating disorders in Colombia and Mexico according to the adolescents' self-report and the parents' report. In Colombia, 17 adolescents between 12 and 18 years old (<i>M</i> = 15.4; <i>SD</i> = 1.8) and one of their parents (<i>n</i> = 17); in Mexico, 8 adolescents between 12 and 17 years old (<i>M</i> = 14.6; <i>SD</i> = 1.6) and one of their parents (<i>n</i> = 8) were evaluated. The parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and the adolescents completed the self-report (YSR) and the EAT-26. The analyses showed a statistically significant correlation between eating problems and anxiety/depression of the YSR (<i>r</i> = 0.39; <i>p</i> = 0.031). Statistically significant differences (<i>p</i> < 0.05) were found in the CBCL scores for externalizing problems, somatic complaints, and rule-breaking behavior; all scores were higher in the Colombian sample. The findings provided partial support for differences between adolescents with eating disorders and parental reports. A higher percentage of clinical levels was reported by adolescents compared to their parents, except for the anxious/depressive and aggressive behavior subscales.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Jaime Humberto Moreno Méndez; María Margarita Rozo Sánchez; Natalia Maldonado Avendaño; Andrés Mauricio Santacoloma Suárez; Julieta Vélez Belmonte; Jesús Adrián Figueroa Hernández; Stephanie Tanus Minutti; Rodrigo César León Hernández
40566354,Behavioral Consequences Among Survivors of Cerebral Malaria and Acceptability to Different Disciplinary Methods.,"Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening disease that affects mainly children in sub-Saharan Africa. Studies have shown that children who survive CM are often left with neurological disabilities after recovery, such as behavioral changes similar to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). However, diagnosis and treatments for ADHD are limited in many places in Africa. The purpose of this study was to assess behavioral changes following CM infection in Children in Malawi and parents' acceptability of behavioral treatments. Twenty-one parents of children who had survived CM were compared to forty parents from the general population. Assessment instruments included the Disruptive Behavior Rating Scale (DBRS), Treatment Evaluation Inventory-Short Form (TEI-SF), and ADHD symptom checklist. The results showed that the most acceptable treatments among parents in Malawi were interrupt/redirect, discussion, and medication. Parents of CM-surviving children were significantly more accepting of medication (<i>F</i>(1,59) = 7.92, <i>p</i> < 0.007). The majority of the children who survived CM were rated above the clinical cut-off for ADHD and ODD symptoms.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Gudlaug Maria Sveinbjornsdottir; Sam Kabota; Sveinbjorn Gizurarson; Urdur Njardvik
40566349,Work-Related Triggers of Mental Illness Relapse in South African Teachers.,"Teachers with mental illness are vulnerable to work-related triggers that can lead to relapse, affecting their mental health and ability to recover, stay employed, and deliver quality education. This empirical study explored such triggers among public school teachers in Limpopo Province, South Africa. Using Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory, a qualitative phenomenological design was adopted. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with 14 participants that were purposively selected across four hospitals. Data were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using Tesch's eight-step open-coding method. Findings revealed being gossiped about by colleagues, excessive workload, limited leadership and parental support, classroom management challenges, high performance expectations without support, and inadequate teacher mental health policies in schools. These triggers can lead to frequent absenteeism and poor teaching outcomes. They will further increase the risk of medication resistance and long-term cognitive decline due to progressive structural brain damage as a result of multiple relapses. The study highlights the urgent need for multi-stakeholder collaboration, including clinicians, academic institutions, union representatives, and the Department of Basic Education, to co-develop effective, context-sensitive strategies to mitigate work-related triggers of mental illness relapse. These strategies are not only essential for enabling long-term workforce participation but also advancing sustainable mental health and well-being.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Thembi Nkomo; Mokoko Percy Kekana; Mabitsela Hezekiel Mphasha
40566339,Exploring the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Student Mental Health: A Repeated Cross-Sectional Study.,"<b>Background</b>: Although mental health among students has become a pressing public concern over recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic introduced new stressors, which may further increase the mental health burden for them. While past work has investigated links between pandemic related factors and student mental health and wellbeing, there is conflicting evidence around some symptoms (e.g., anxiety) and little work has focused on less common mental health conditions (e.g., eating disorders). <b>Aims</b>: The current study aimed to detail the prevalence of mental distress in the student population at an early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic and compare university students' mental health before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we aimed to compare levels of depression, anxiety, and eating disorders in a large sample of students. <b>Methods</b>: We analysed data from a repeated cross-sectional survey on different samples of UK university students before the pandemic (<i>n</i> = 4812) and during the pandemic (<i>n</i> = 3817). <b>Results</b>: There were high levels of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 50% experiencing levels above the clinical cut-offs. Findings revealed a significant increase in symptoms of depression and anxiety from pre- to mid-pandemic as well as a significant increase in the prevalence of eating disorders. <b>Conclusions</b>: By late 2020, mental health in the student population had deteriorated compared to pre-pandemic levels. These findings provide evidence for increased levels of depression, anxiety, and eating disorders related to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need for better preparedness for future crises in order to mitigate the impact on student mental health.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Joanne Worsley; Jason McIntyre; Rhiannon Corcoran
40566337,Family Support Experiences of Adult Persons with Intellectual Disability and Challenging Behaviour: A Scoping Review of Qualitative Studies.,"There has been scant research on the experiences of families caring for adults with intellectual disability who use challenging behaviour as a way of making their needs known. The aim of this scoping review was to synthesize the qualitative research data on the family support experiences of adult family members with intellectual disability who use challenging behaviour in this way. A systematic search was undertaken from five databases during December 2024 and updated in April 2025. A total of 20 studies were included in the review. Data were analysed using a thematic analysis method. The number of study participants in these studies ranged from 4 to 30. Most of them were parents and predominantly mothers. The results show that caring for adults with intellectual disability and challenging behaviour reflects a dual reality. The negative experiences refer to caregiving difficulties and inadequate formal support, while the positive experiences are associated with support from informal sources and caregivers' fulfilment and gains. The available research did not offer sufficient data for a synthesis of how families might be affected by challenging behaviour. Future research should investigate how the negative and positive aspects of their families can be shaped to make a positive impact on caring for people with intellectual disability and co-existing challenging behaviour.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Alice Nga Lai Kwong; Lisa Pau Le Low; Maggie Yat Cheung Wong
40566334,The Longitudinal Relationship Between Physical Functions and Cognitive Functions Among Middle-Aged and Older Adults in Primary Care.,"(1) Background: Gait speed (GS) and handgrip strength (HGS) have been identified as factors in cognitive impairment, depression, sleep problems, and quality of life. This study aims to comprehensively investigate the longitudinal relationship between physical functions (gait speed and handgrip strength) and cognitive functions, as well as cognitive decline, in middle-aged and older adults in China. (2) Methods: Using longitudinal data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), we analyzed 1903 subjects aged 60 and above with repeated measurements of GS, and 4218 subjects aged 45 and above with repeated measurements of HGS. The cognitive functions we considered included drawing ability, word recall, TICS-10, and an overall cognitive score (OCS). Mixed-effect logistic and linear regression were used to analyze the association between GS/HGS and cognitive functions in middle-aged and older adults with repeated measurements. (3) Results: A faster GS is associated with better drawing ability (OR = 1.33, <i>p</i> = 0.045) and TICS-10 (OR = 1.60, <i>p</i> = 0.024). A stronger HGS is associated with higher odds of drawing ability (OR = 1.36, <i>p</i> = 0.012) and better TICS-10 (OR = 1.41, <i>p</i> = 0.018). Both weak HGS and slow GS are significantly associated with a higher decline in cognitive function, while HGS is more predictive of the decline for women and GS is more predictive for men. (4) Conclusions: Both GS and HG are positively associated with cognitive functions cross-sectionally and longitudinally in middle-aged and older adults. Health interventions targeting HGS and GS may help improve cognitive functions. Future research is warranted to establish the causal relationship between these interventions and improvements in cognitive functions.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Nan Hu; Wupeng Yin; Rabeya Illyas Noon; Noof Alabdullatif
40566331,Post-Traumatic Sequelae and Their Associated Factors: A Cross-Sectional Study in the Northern Mountainous Region of Vietnam.,"Post-traumatic sequelae have many negative impacts on the health and quality of life of patients, especially for those groups at a high risk of exposure to injuries. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify some factors related to post-traumatic sequelae in people in a mountainous province in Northern Vietnam. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 228 residents from two communes (Pom Lot and Thanh Minh) in Dien Bien province. The participants had all experienced an injury from any cause within the year preceding the study. The post-traumatic sequelae and potential associated factors were assessed. The rate of post-traumatic sequelae among the study participants was 62.3%. An older age (>40), belonging to an ethnic minority group, a short treatment duration, and a lack of family and social support were factors associated with an increased risk of post-traumatic sequelae. Post-traumatic stress disorder is a significant health burden for people in the mountainous regions of Northern Vietnam. This study identified vulnerable groups, particularly the elderly, ethnic minorities, and those with inadequate treatment or social support. The results highlight the urgent need for targeted interventions and focused support policies to reduce the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder for this high-risk group.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Nguyen The Diep; Tran The Hien
40566328,Enriched Motor Program [EMP]: Adaptation of a Physical Activity Intervention for Enhancing Executive Functions in Children with ASD.,"Recent studies indicate that physical activity (PA) may improve executive functions (EFs) in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The Enriched Motor Program (EMP), which combines aerobic and cognitive exercises, shows potential for enhancing EFs in these children. The EMP was originally created for typically developing preschoolers and includes locomotor and fine motor activities enriched by cognitive stimuli to help the development of EFs in children with ASD. The current study aims to adapt a shorter version of EMP for these children's needs. The research will use a cross-sectional, quasi-experimental design with a forecasted sample of 40 children, with the age ranging from six to eight, with a diagnosis of ASD. The children's working memory and inhibitory control will be measured before and after the intervention. According to the literature, the experimental group should obtain higher scores, especially in working memory tasks. This is the first implementation of EMP, which merges physical activities with cognitive stimuli to enhance EFs in children with ASD. It could be used by specialized centers and clinicians to support EFs through engaging activities, and it could be potentially recommended as a best practice for EF treatments in children with ASD.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Gabriele Gullo; Ambra Gentile; Marianna Alesi
40566321,Partnering with Family Organizations in Research: Experiences from the Field.,"Parent Peer Support (PPS) provided by other caregivers who have lived experience raising a child with mental health conditions (e.g., such as anxiety, depression, attention, and/or behavior disorders) holds promise as a service that can improve outcomes by helping young people and their families overcome system- and individual-level barriers to receiving care. Here, we describe the development of a collaboration of researchers and Family-Run Organizations (FROs) to provide research support for PPS through three phases (1) developing a research agenda and study aims through a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) ""Pipeline to Proposal"" grant; (2) designing a pilot study, including refining the measurement framework for a successful grant application to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); and (3) implementing the study through the incorporation of research methodology into FRO operations without disrupting the organizations' missions. This paper summarizes the participatory action research (PAR) strategies employed by this interdisciplinary research team throughout the three phases, covering the benefits and challenges of these unique partnership activities. We focus on how this project was able to increase the relevance of the research to the FROs and the communities they serve and improve dissemination and utilization of the results to support other PPS projects.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Jessica Holmes; Tennyson Dahlman; Eric J Bruns; Misty Woody; Melissa Hendricks; Millie Sweeney; Bruno J Anthony
40566320,"""We Just Improvise"": Exploring Teachers' Perspectives on Sport Participation for Learners with Intellectual Disabilities in Rural South Africa.","Participation in sports offers children with intellectual disabilities (IDs) crucial opportunities for development. However, they often face barriers to inclusion in school-based sports, especially in under-resourced areas. This study aimed to (1) assess the level of participation in school sports among learners with IDs, and (2) explore teachers' perceptions of the benefits and barriers to such participation in special schools within the Vhembe District of South Africa. A qualitative, descriptive research design was employed. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 teachers from four special schools. Thematic analysis helped identify key themes and interpret responses. All schools offered weekly sports activities, as required by the Department of Education. Teachers viewed sports as vital for social interaction, physical fitness, and psychological well-being. However, barriers such as insufficient adapted equipment, inadequate facilities, and limited family support hindered meaningful participation, particularly for learners with profound disabilities. School sports have the potential to transform the lives of learners with IDs, but systemic barriers restrict access. Increased investment in inclusive infrastructure, adaptive equipment, teacher training, and community awareness is essential to align policy with practice in special education.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Avhasei Dorothy Meregi; Phumudzo Khangwelo Mulibana; Gudani Goodman Mukoma
40566311,"Predictors of Low Back Pain Risk Among Farmers in Rural Communities of Loja, Ecuador.","Low back pain (LBP) and musculoskeletal disorders are highly prevalent among agricultural workers. However, there is limited epidemiological evidence from rural regions of Ecuador, where working and living conditions may differ substantially from those in other settings. This study aimed to identify predictors of LBP among farmers in rural Ecuador to inform locally relevant prevention strategies. Participants aged 30 to 60 years (<i>n</i> = 103) were recruited through a traveling health clinic. Participants were assessed with behavioral and sociodemographic self-report questionnaires and anthropometric measurements. Low back pain (LBP) was assessed using the Standardized Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire, which asked about symptoms experienced in the past 12 months. Bivariate (Chi-square and Fisher exact tests) and multivariate (binary logistic regression) analyses were conducted to explore associations between risk factors and LBP in individuals aged 30 to 60 years. LBP was highly prevalent, affecting 78.6% of participants. Behavioral patterns were mixed, with low rates of smoking and moderate alcohol and coffee consumption associated with LBP. A normal body mass index (BMI) was observed in 66% of the sample, and over half reported stable mood and good self-perceived health. In the binary logistic regression analysis, only education level significantly predicted LBP, with secondary education acting as a protective factor. While lower back pain was widespread in the population studied, most risk factors that were analyzed were not significantly associated with its presence.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Isabel Masson Palacios; Israel Vinueza-Fernandez; Samuel-Olegario Iñiguez-Jiminez; Mario J Grijalva; Benjamin R Bates
40566305,Bullying in Students with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): Analyzing Students' Social Status and Student-Teacher Relationship Quality.,"The present study investigated how the quality of teacher-student relationships and students' social status among peers relate to bullying experiences in children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and those with typical development (TD). A sample of 135 students (27 with ADHD and 108 with TD; <i>M</i> = 11.37, <i>SD</i> = 1.25) participated. Using a structural equation model, we examined whether ADHD predicted students' relationships with teachers and peers and whether these variables, in turn, predicted bullying victimization and perpetration. The model showed a good fit. Children with ADHD reported more conflictual relationships with teachers, lower peer preference, and higher social impact compared to their typically developing peers. These relationship characteristics were differentially associated with bullying outcomes, with teacher-student conflict and peer visibility emerging as social risk factors. Although preliminary, the results suggest that the relational context-particularly teacher attention and peer dynamics-may play a critical role in shaping the social experiences of students with ADHD and could have unintended consequences within peer groups.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Sofia Mastrokoukou; Martina Berchiatti; Laura Badenes-Ribera; Laura Galiana; Claudio Longobardi
40566294,"Predictors of Anxiety, Depression, and Stress in Long COVID: Systematic Review of Prevalence.","Anxiety, depression, and stress are prevalent psychosocial manifestations in Long COVID, and understanding their global impact can guide safe, effective, and evidence-based interventions. This study reviewed the literature to analyze the prevalence indicators and predictors of anxiety, depression, or stress experienced by adults and older adults with Long COVID. This systematic prevalence review was conducted using the databases MEDLINE via PubMed<sup>®</sup>, CINAHL-EBSCO, Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE, LILACS, and BDENF. Observational studies that assessed anxiety, depression, or perceived stress in adults and older adults with Long COVID were included, with no restrictions on time or language. Two reviewers independently conducted the selection process. Full texts were analyzed for their eligibility potential. Methodological quality was assessed using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Studies. Ten observational studies with moderate methodological quality were included. Anxiety and depression were the most prevalent psychosocial symptoms in Long COVID, reported in mild, moderate, and severe cases of COVID-19 infection. Prevalence rates reached up to 47.8% for anxiety, 37.3% for depression, and 23% for stress. The combined analysis revealed a pooled prevalence of 15.3% (95% CI: 10.8% to 20.2%). Being female, having pre-existing mental disorders or associated clinical comorbidities, experiencing severe infection in the acute phase, and receiving intensive care were predictors of greater mental burden. The experience of anxiety, depression, and stress in prolonged COVID-19 was reported in countries with different income levels and was disproportionately experienced, especially by women and individuals with associated clinical conditions or psychopathological comorbidities.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Daniel de Macêdo Rocha; Andrey Oeiras Pedroso; Mayra Gonçalves Menegueti; Renata Cristina de Campos Pereira Silveira; Laelson Rochelle Milanês Sousa; Elucir Gir; Renata Karina Reis
40566287,Dementia Education and Training for In-Patient Health Care Support Workers in Acute Care Contexts: A Mixed-Methods Pilot Evaluation.,"To understand dementia care knowledge, attitudes, and confidence among acute-care support staff following a dementia education intervention titled Dementia Workforce Excellence in Acute Care. A convergent parallel mixed-methods pilot study. Data were collected from 30 participants using an online survey and three individual interviews between January and March 2024. Survey data were analysed using descriptive statistics, and a thematic analysis underpinned by Kirkpatrick's framework was used to analyse the qualitative data from interviews. The online survey established good levels of dementia knowledge, attitudes, and confidence among support staff with enhanced attitudes among staff who completed the training. Analysis of interviews resulted in three themes: dementia in the acute care setting; motivation for learning; and evaluation of the intervention on four levels [satisfaction, learning gains, behaviours, and results]. Findings suggest that the dementia education intervention used in this study is a comprehensive dementia training resource that promotes person-centred and compassionate dementia care across all stages of the dementia journey. Dementia is a public health priority with workforce education identified as a key response for capacity building. This pilot evaluation offers insight and new learning on the pedagogical approaches that are inclusive of peer-supported reflective learning in small groups that remain untapped for dementia workforce development. Dementia inclusive and enabling environments with a knowledgeable and skilled workforce are crucial to mitigate stigma and discrimination. This can be best achieved by raising awareness through targeted staff education and training to make hospital environments more dementia inclusive. Patient or Public Contributions: Dementia care scenarios used in this study were co-designed by experts with lived experience of dementia. Additionally, these experts along with family carers of people living with dementia were involved in the delivery of the training where appropriate.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Leah Macaden; Kevin Muirhead; Juliet MacArthur; Siobhan Blair
40566285,Testing the Efficacy of RESPONSIBLEPLAY<sup>©</sup>: A Multi-Theory Model (MTM)-Based Intervention Protocol for Promoting Responsible Gambling Among College Students.,"Gambling behaviors among college students are a growing public health concern, with problem gambling rates significantly higher in this population than in the general public. This study outlines the protocol for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the efficacy of RESPONSIBLEPLAY<sup>©</sup>, a Multi-theory Model (MTM)-based intervention designed to promote responsible gambling behaviors. Proposed Methods: The intervention integrates six MTM constructs-participatory dialogue, behavioral confidence, changes in the physical environment, emotional transformation, practice for change, and changes in the social environment-to address the initiation and sustenance of behavior change. College students aged 21 and older, scoring 3 or higher on the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI), will be randomly assigned to either the MTM-based intervention group or a traditional knowledge-based intervention group. The participants will complete surveys assessing PGSI and MTM constructs at pre-test, post-test, and eight-week follow-up. This study aims to provide evidence for the efficacy of theory-driven intervention compared to a knowledge-based approach. If successful, this protocol will establish a robust framework for mitigating gambling-related harm in vulnerable college populations, paving the way for scalable, evidence-based interventions in diverse settings. The findings will contribute to the development of public health strategies that integrate theoretical constructs with practical applications to address high-risk behaviors.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Sidath Kapukotuwa; Kavita Batra; Christopher Johansen; Manoj Sharma
40566282,Longitudinal Associations Between Sources of Uncertainty and Mental Health Amongst Resettled Refugees During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"The COVID-19 pandemic may have disproportionately affected forcibly displaced people due to parallel uncertainties such as visa insecurity and family separation. This study explicitly examined whether different sources of uncertainty contributed in specific ways to increased psychological symptoms for refugees during the pandemic. A large cohort of 733 refugees and asylum seekers settled in Australia completed a mental health survey in June 2020 (T1) and 12 months later in June 2021 (T2). Using cross-lagged panel modelling, we tested changes in post-traumatic stress (PTS), depression and anxiety symptoms, visa status, family separation and COVID-19 uncertainty stress, and the contribution of intolerance of uncertainty (trait prospective and inhibitory), controlling for age, sex, trauma exposure, language, and time in Australia. Visa status and family separation stress at T1 predicted increased depression (bidirectional pathways) and PTS symptoms at T2 (unidirectional pathways), respectively. Visa status uncertainty at T1 was also associated with increases in COVID-19 and family separation stress at T2. Intolerance of uncertainty showed limited associations with symptoms and stressors. Findings demonstrate that different forms of refugee uncertainty had specific impacts on psychopathology during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Refugees facing diverse kinds of stress may benefit from individual, community, and policy level support targeted to their specific circumstances and mental health needs during future crises.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Belinda J Liddell; Stephanie Murphy; Yulisha Byrow; Meaghan O'Donnell; Vicki Mau; Tadgh McMahon; Richard A Bryant; Philippa Specker; Angela Nickerson
40566276,Systematic Intervention with Formal Caregivers to Promote Nutritional Health of Older People with Dementia: An Impact Evaluation Study.,"Nutritional health is essential for older people with dementia. Their feeding is a challenge for which caregivers are not always ready, and an intervention that supports them may have a significant social impact. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate the impact of systematic nursing intervention with formal caregivers to promote nutritional health for older people with dementia. This is a ""Nursing Methodology Research"" study conducted with formal caregivers of older people with dementia in four Colombian nursing homes. It includes three consecutive phases: (1) systematic intervention design under Whittemore and Grey's parameters, (2) intervention validation with seven international experts, and (3) measurement of intervention impact, which included a quasi-experimental pre-test-post-test design. The ""Nurturing Neurons-Formal Caregivers"" intervention met the criteria of systematic health interventions. In response to the work and personal requirements of formal caregivers, the intervention used a tele-support modality. Its content validity ratio (CVR) ranged from 0.88 to 0.92; its content validity index (CVI) was 0.90. The experience was positive for the participant caregivers (94.9%) and professional providers (92.5%). The overall caregivers' caring competence changed from the medium, 78.1, to the high category, 91.5 (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Their perceived burden of care changed from 70.4 to 63.6 (<i>p</i> < 0.001). In conclusion, ""Nurturing Neurons-Formal Caregivers"" achieved a positive impact, with changes in the structure, processes, and outputs to promote the nutritional health of older people with dementia. It led to a significant improvement in formal caregivers' caring competence and decreased their perceived care burden. Its cost-benefit was favorable; it generated health equity for a vulnerable population and achieved unexpected benefits in the context.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Paola Sarmiento-González; María Elisa Moreno-Fergusson; Alejandra Rojas-Rivera; Juan Alcides Cuadros-Mojica; Bibiana Ramírez-Pulido; Beatriz Sánchez-Herrera
40566271,DSM-5 Criteria for Alcohol and Cannabis Use Disorders: Are Older Adults Less Likely to Endorse Certain Criteria?,"With increasing substance misuse among older adults, we examined the question of whether older adults may be less likely to endorse certain DSM-5 criteria for alcohol and cannabis use disorders (AUD and CUD). We used the 2021-2023 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (<i>N</i> = 17,494 for AUD and <i>N</i> = 12,264 for CUD) and descriptive statistics to compare the 65+ and under 65 age groups in their endorsements of 11 DSM-5 criteria. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted for each criterion as the dependent variable with the age group as the independent variable and other characteristics as covariates. For AUD, the 65+ age group was associated with lower odds of endorsing seven out of eleven DSM-5 criteria, including social impairments (e.g., failure to fulfill role obligations (aOR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.16-0.56); social problems (aOR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.30-0.71); given-up activities (aOR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.47-0.94); hazardous use (aOR = 0.53, 95% Yes CI = 0.34-0.81); and physical/psychological problems (aOR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.37-0.70). For CUD, the 65+ age group was less likely than the under 65 age group to endorse hazardous use (aOR = 0.04, 95% CI = 0.01-0.17) and withdrawal (aOR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.20-0.73 for criterion A and aOR = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.05-0.48 for criterion B). Clinicians should be aware that older adults might not express the full range of symptoms in the same way as the younger age groups. A more nuanced understanding of older adults' social context may be needed for accurate diagnosis.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Namkee G Choi; Jeffrey A Morris; C Nathan Marti
40566256,Frequent Users in Psychiatric Consultations: A 6-Year Retrospective Study in the Emergency Department.,"The increasing prevalence of emergency room (ER) visits for mental health concerns presents a significant challenge for healthcare systems. This study aimed to analyze the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics associated with frequent users of psychiatric consultations in the ER of Maggiore della Carità University Hospital in Novara, Italy. A retrospective observational study was conducted over a six-year period (2017-2022), including all psychiatric consultations recorded in a hospital database. Frequent users were defined as individuals undergoing at least three psychiatric consultations in the ER within a year. Univariable and multivariable logistic models were employed to identify significant socio-demographic and clinical predictors of frequent use. Of the 1565 individuals who received psychiatric consultations in the ER, 92 (5.88%) were identified as frequent users. Factors associated with higher ER utilization included being unmarried (aOR 1.35, 95% CI 1.02-1.79), younger age (aOR 1.32, 95% CI 1.02-1.72), homelessness, diagnosis of schizophrenia, substance use disorder (aOR 1.49, 95% CI 1.06-2.09), and ongoing psychopharmacological treatment (aOR 1.56, 95% CI 1.12-2.18).

40566251,Influence of Socio-Ecological and Economic Correlates on Marijuana Legalization Policy Across the States of America.,"Marijuana legalization has been at the center of debate in the social and political realm of the United States. So far, thirty nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana either for recreational or medical purposes. States are taking a cautious approach to legalization in a policy context consisting of multi-layered sociopolitical systems. Strong arguments from advocacy groups supporting and opposing legalization highlight the significance of assessing the impact of marijuana use and its legalization on the well-being of the community and its members. Utilizing the social determinants of health and system perspectives, this study measures the cumulative effect of six socio-ecological and economic predictors, such as the state's marijuana use prevalence and median household income, on the dependent variable of marijuana legality scores using discriminant analysis and One-way ANOVA. As hypothesized, the result shows a significant influence of the predictors on the state policy score of marijuana legality. Predicted associations between independent and dependent variables were also found. Findings suggest that without a supportive policy context comprising social, economic, and political factors, marijuana legalization might not have the desired impact on the community. Implications and recommendations for future research are provided.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Mashooq Salehin; Vijayan K Pillai
40566244,Health Knowledge About Early Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Case for Soft Transdiagnostic Approaches to Better Represent the Clinical and Scientific Reality of ASD.,"This study explores the current state of science regarding DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in young children. It examines the effectiveness of existing diagnostic methods and evaluates the potential of transdiagnostic approaches for early intervention. A systematic literature review was conducted using MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, focusing on peer-reviewed studies published between 2020 and 2023. The search followed PRISMA guidelines, selecting articles investigating ASD diagnosis in toddlers and preschoolers using DSM-5 criteria, behavioral assessments, and emerging diagnostic tools. Findings indicate that DSM-5 provides a structured framework for ASD diagnosis, but it has limitations in early identification. It is necessary to integrate multiple assessment tools. Recent research highlights transdiagnostic models, which move beyond rigid diagnostic categories to capture the complexities of ASD presentation in young children. The literature supports a shift towards a transdiagnostic approach that combines behavioral, biological, and environmental assessments. This study underscores the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to refine ASD diagnostic frameworks to ensure more accurate and timely diagnoses that better serve affected children and their families.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Mirah Dow; Ting Wang

40566242,The Roles of Dissociation and Depression in PTSD Among Soldiers Exposed to Combat.,"Exposure to severe combat situations significantly raises the risk of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Trauma survivors may use dissociation as a defense mechanism, increasing the likelihood of PTSD. This study aims to explore the roles of dissociation and depression in PTSD among soldiers exposed to combat who sought help from the Israel Combat Stress Reaction Unit. <b>Method:</b> This cross-sectional study involved 927 individuals who participated in a particular military operation in 2014 [98.5% male (<i>n</i> = 906); mean age = 27.08 (SD = 5.93)]. Participants completed three questionnaires: the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Post-Traumatic Stress Symptom Checklist (PCL-5) for PTSD. <b>Results:</b> Our results showed that severe PTSD (PCL score ≥ 33) was found in 30.4% of participants, and 76.6% showed dissociative symptoms (DES score ≥ 30). Additionally, 23.5% experienced moderate depression, while 19.1% reported severe depressive symptoms. A Generalized Linear Model revealed that both depression and dissociation significantly contribute to PTSD. Individuals with depression were three times more likely to experience post-traumatic symptoms compared to 1.23 times for those with dissociative symptoms. <b>Conclusions:</b> Life-threatening situations significantly predicted higher PTSD symptoms, serving as a risk factor for depression and dissociation, which play important roles in PTSD, with depression having notably greater impact.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2025,Leah Shelef; Nir Spira; Uzi Bechor; Jacob Rotschield; Eran Shadach
40566132,Visualization of the Glymphatic System Through Brain Magnetic Resonance in Human Subjects with Neurodegenerative Disorders: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"<b>Background:</b> One of the major contributors to homeostasis at the level of the central nervous system, specifically the brain, is the glymphatic system, which is described as an exchange occurring at the level of and between the interstitial fluid and cerebrospinal fluid that has been linked to neurodegenerative processes. <b>Methods</b>: Fourteen studies were included after PROSPERO registration and a literature search. Screening, reviewing, and data extraction were performed by two reviewers. Quality assessment scales were used. General continuous and subgroup analysis, heterogeneity tests, and random effect models were run using SPSS. Forest plots were constructed based on subgroup analysis. <b>Results</b>: Significant correlations (<i>p</i> < 0.05) were detected between MRI indices and outcomes quantifying neurodegenerative diseases. Studies on Alzheimer's disease showed a positive correlation between diffusivity indices and cognitive scores. Studies on Parkinson's disease showed negative correlations between diffusivity indices and disease severity, progression, and motor function (<i>p</i> < 0.05). As for other conditions, the conclusions remain uncertain, yet positive results were detected (<i>p</i> < 0.05). <b>Conclusions</b>: Positive significant correlations were deduced between the ALPS index and cognitive scores, indicating that low cognition is correlated with a low ALPS index and enlarged PVSs. Negative significant correlations were deduced between ALPS indices and UPDRS scores, indicating motor dysfunction is correlated with lower ALPS indices and enlarged PVSs. Finally, MRI parameters may help to deduce disease progression across subgroups. Despite the presence of heterogeneity between studies, significant correlations with moderate to large effect sizes were detected. Glymphatic dysfunction measured through MRI indices is correlated with neurodegenerative changes across various neurological conditions.",Journal of clinical medicine,2025,Jana Hamzeh; Hayat Harati; Farah Ayoubi; Marie-Belle Saab; Lea Saab; Elie Al Ahmar; Elias Estephan
40566110,The Mental Health of Children with Cerebral Palsy: A Review of the Last Five Years of Research.,"Children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP) often experience associated functional limitations, diseases, or impairments. Included in these associated concerns are mental health symptoms/disorders and academic concerns. There has been an increasing research focus on the mental health of youth with CP over the past 5 years, and there is a need to synthesize this research. This review aims to synthesize the most recent research on the mental and behavioral health of youth with CP. A literature search on research focused on mental health, academic functioning, and mental and behavioral treatment for youth with CP was conducted in August of 2024 and limited to the last 5 years to highlight the most recent developments in this area of research. Four hundred and forty-eight articles were screened, and thirty-eight articles were included in this review. Based on this literature review, children with CP have high rates of mental health diagnoses across multiple diagnostic areas, including autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, intellectual developmental disorder, anxiety, and depression. Academic concerns are common for children with CP. Intervention studies have focused on both child and parent interventions. Research over the past 5 years has added to prevalence estimates of mental health disorders in the pediatric CP population. Considering the high rates of mental health symptoms found in children with CP, future research should focus further on mental health interventions for this population.",Journal of clinical medicine,2025,Rebecca Rausch; Summer Chahin; Caroline Miller; Lindsey Dopheide; Nicholas Bovio; Ann Harris; Dilip Patel
40566084,Axis I of DC/TMD in Diagnosis of Temporomandibular Disorders in People with Multiple Sclerosis-Preliminary Reports.,"<b>Background:</b> The primary objective of our preliminary study was to estimate the prevalence of temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Furthermore, we aimed to investigate whether there is a correlation between the presence of TMDs and the level of MS-related disability. <b>Methods:</b> The study was conducted at two centers in Poland dealing with the treatment of MS between March 2025 and April 2025. The study used an original survey questionnaire, the European Academy of Craniomandibular Diseases (EACD) questionnaire and the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD). The study group included people with multiple sclerosis, while the control group consisted of healthy people without neurological deficits. The study group was examined using the following methods: the McDonald criteria and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). <b>Results:</b> The study involved 90 people (45 in both groups). The majority of the study participants were women (80.0%), aged 20-30 years (51.1%) and people living in small towns (51.1%). The largest number of patients with MS were noted with RRMS (75.5%). The duration of the disease was on average 3.3 ± 2.4, and the EDSS score was on average 2.5 ± 1.5. People from the study group significantly (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05; ES = 0.52-0.86) reported TMDs more frequently based on EACD (pain on opening the mouth: 86.7%; facial pain: 57.8%; joint locking: 28.9%; headaches: 75.3%). The diagnosis of TMDs was confirmed in 40.0% of people with MS and 11.1% of healthy volunteers (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05). Patients most frequently reported muscle pain and disk displacement with reduction (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05). The disability score in the MS group did not exhibit differences in the occurrence of TMDs (<i>p</i> > 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> The study showed that TMDs are more common in people with multiple sclerosis. The degree of disability did not differentiate the occurrence of TMDs. The authors intend to expand research on the influence of potential risk factors on the occurrence of TMDs in people with multiple sclerosis.",Journal of clinical medicine,2025,Martyna Odzimek; Hubert Lipiński; Piotr Dubiński; Marek Żak; Waldemar Brola
40566080,Reported Adverse Events in Patients with CF Receiving Treatment with Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor: 5 Years Observational Study.,"<b>Background:</b> Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) treatment is showing remarkable beneficial effects in people with Cystic Fibrosis (pwCF) harboring the F508del mutation in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (<i>CFTR</i>) gene. Although this therapy is generally well tolerated in pwCF, some adverse events (AEs) have been recently described both in controlled studies and in post-marketing observations. <b>Methods</b>: We followed 414 pwCF carrying F508del <i>CFTR</i> that initiated ETI treatment, recording AEs for a period of 5 years. <b>Results</b>: A total of 142 AEs were reported. The most frequent AEs in the whole cohort were liver marker elevation, skin rush, epigastric pain, headache, and depression. Considering pediatric subjects, psychiatric and gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequent AEs. Only one patient reported a severe AE, leading to treatment discontinuation. In case of AEs, different decisions on ETI treatment were made, including temporary interruption and temporary or permanent dosage modification. <b>Conclusions</b>: Throughout the long-term observational period, almost 21% of pwCF experienced at least one AE. Psychiatric disorders, in particular attention deficit, were the most prevalent issue in our pediatric cohort, whereas adult patients mainly reported depression, anxiety and sleep disorders. This study therefore strengthen the recommendation of screening for changes in mental health during ETI treatment. AEs led to the permanent reduction of ETI dosage in 32% of cases, raising the issue of safety in relation to dosage reduction, efficacy, and minimum ETI levels. Eventually, this study highlights the need for a longitudinal monitoring of ETI safety since a significant number of AEs occurred after one year of treatment.",Journal of clinical medicine,2025,Francesca Lucca; Ilaria Meneghelli; Gloria Tridello; Francesca Buniotto; Giulia Cucchetto; Sonia Volpi; Emily Pintani; Valentino Bezzerri; Marco Cipolli
40566073,Light and Food: Body Image Moderates the Effects of Chronotype on the Risk to Develop an Eating Disorder.,"<b>Background:</b> Evening chronotypes are increasingly recognized as being at elevated risk of psychological vulnerabilities, including sleep disturbances, mood disorders, and disordered eating. Body image, a central self-related construct, has been identified as a key factor influencing eating disorder (ED) risk. This study aimed to explore whether body image moderates the relationship between chronotype and the risk of developing an ED. <b>Methods</b>: A total of 165 adults (139 women; mean age = 35.45) completed validated self-report questionnaires assessing chronotype (Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire), body image (Body Shape Questionnaire), and ED risk (EAT-26). Pearson correlations and moderation analyses (PROCESS macro and Model 1) were conducted with body image as a moderator of the association between chronotype and ED risk. <b>Results</b>: Eveningness was significantly associated with greater ED risk (r = -0.53, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and a more negative body image (r = -0.48, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Body image was a strong predictor of ED risk (r = 0.85, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Moderation analysis revealed a significant interaction between chronotype and body image (b = -0.006, SE = 0.0009, <i>p</i> < 0.001), indicating that the relationship between chronotype and ED risk was stronger among individuals with a more negative body image. <b>Conclusions</b>: These findings highlight the role of body image as a moderating factor in the link between chronotype and eating disorder vulnerability. Interventions aimed at improving body image, especially among evening chronotypes, may help mitigate ED risk. These results underscore the importance of integrating circadian and psychosocial factors in ED prevention and early intervention strategies.",Journal of clinical medicine,2025,Anat Lan; Lior Harel; Haim Einat
40566026,Depression and Coronary Artery Disease-Where We Stand?,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) and mental health disorders, particularly depression and anxiety, exhibit a complex, bidirectional relationship that adversely influences clinical outcomes and mortality. Mental illnesses account for approximately 8 million deaths annually, while cardiovascular diseases, including CAD, contribute to about 17 million deaths, with CAD alone responsible for one-third of deaths among individuals aged ≥35 years. This review offers a structured synthesis of current knowledge focusing on the (1) epidemiology, emphasizing the reciprocal risk between CAD and psychiatric conditions; (2) pathophysiological insights, including inflammation, neurohormonal dysregulation, platelet hyperactivation, and shared genetic determinants; and (3) therapeutic approaches, encompassing pharmacological management, psychotherapeutic interventions, and integrated care models. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) remain the pharmacologic agents of choice in patients with CAD and depression due to their favorable cardiac profile, while cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) offers psychological benefit. However, evidence for mortality reduction remains limited. Emerging research highlights the importance of biomarker-driven care, gut-brain-heart axis modulation, and AI-enabled clinical integration.",Journal of clinical medicine,2025,Anastasios Apostolos; Konstantinos Konstantinou; Nikolaos Ktenopoulos; Panayotis K Vlachakis; Ioannis Skalidis; Grigorios Chrysostomidis; Vasileios Panoulas; Konstantinos Tsioufis
40566012,Benzodiazepine Misuse Among Health Care Workers: The Effect of Sleep Disorders on Work Performance.,"<b>Background</b>: Benzodiazepines (BZDs), commonly used to treat insomnia and anxiety, are increasingly used in Spain, raising concerns due to their potential for abuse and dependence. This study investigates the use of BZDs and other psychotropic medications among healthcare workers, exploring their prevalence, associated factors, and their relationship with mental health issues following the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods</b>: An anonymous online survey was conducted among healthcare workers at the Salamanca University Healthcare Complex (CAUSA) from March 2023 to January 2024. Of 1121 participants, 685 provided complete responses, which were analysed. Insomnia, anxiety, and depression were assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4). <b>Results</b>: Of the respondents, 23.8% reported using sleep medication, with 27.8% doing so without a prescription. Additionally, 14.7% used medication for depression or anxiety, with only 0.6% without a prescription. Hypnotic medicine use was associated with older age, insomnia, anxiety, depression, psychological or psychiatric treatment, COVID-19 after-effects, and diagnosed sleep disorders. Night-shift work was associated with increased hypnotic medication use in men but not in women. The use of these medications was linked to a reduced quality of life and impaired work performance. <b>Conclusions</b>: The use of BZD and self-medication are prevalent among healthcare professionals, exceeding the rates observed in the general population. These findings highlight the urgent need for targeted interventions to address psychotropic medication use, promote other pharmacological and non-pharmacological alternatives for insomnia, and enhance mental health support for this vulnerable population.",Journal of clinical medicine,2025,Carlos Roncero; José Lorenzo Bravo-Grande; Pilar Andrés-Olivera; Marta Peña; Carlos Treceño; Pilar González-Pelaez; Lourdes Aguilar; Diego Remón-Gallo; Armando González-Sánchez
40565990,"Safety, Cognitive, and Behavioral Outcomes in Patients with Dementia with Lewy Bodies Treated with Nilotinib.","<b>Background/Objectives:</b> We previously demonstrated that nilotinib can sufficiently enter the brain to pharmacologically inhibit discoidin domain receptors (DDR)-1 in patients with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. We primarily hypothesized that nilotinib is safe, and may alter disease-related biomarkers to improve, motor, cognitive and/or behavioral features in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). <b>Methods</b>: Forty-three participants were randomized 1:1 into nilotinib, 200 mg, or matching placebo in a single-center, phase 2, randomized, double-blind study. Study drug was taken orally once daily for 6 months followed by one-month wash-out. <b>Results</b>: Of 43 individuals enrolled, 14 were women (33%); age (mean ± SD) was 73 ± 8.5 years. Nilotinib was safe and well-tolerated, and more adverse events were noted in the placebo (74) vs. nilotinib (37) groups (<i>p</i> = 0.054). The number of falls were reduced in the nilotinib (six) compared to placebo (21) group (<i>p</i> = 0.006). Cerebrospinal fluid homovanillic acid, a biomarker of dopamine levels, was increased (<i>p</i> = 0.004), while the ratio of pTau181/Aβ42 was reduced (<i>p</i> = 0.034). The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognition 14 improved by 2.8 pts (<i>p</i> = 0.037), and no differences were observed in Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale parts II and III. However, part I (cognition) improved (<i>p</i> = 0.044) in nilotinib compared to placebo. <b>Conclusions</b>: Nilotinib demonstrates favorable safety, biomarkers, and efficacy outcomes in patients with DLB supporting further trials in DLB or advanced Parkinson's disease with dementia.",Journal of clinical medicine,2025,Fernando Pagan; Yasar Torres-Yaghi; Michaeline Hebron; Barbara Wilmarth; R Scott Turner; Sara Matar; Xiaoguang Liu; Dalila Ferrante; Giuseppe Esposito; Jaeil Ahn; Charbel Moussa
40565914,A Structured Narrative Review of the OSA-T2DM Axis.,"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are two highly prevalent and interconnected conditions with significant implications for morbidity and mortality. Emerging evidence suggests a bidirectional relationship between the two disorders, mediated by shared pathophysiological mechanisms such as intermittent hypoxia, systemic inflammation, and autonomic dysfunction. <b>Methods</b>: A structured narrative review of the literature was conducted using a comprehensive PubMed search of clinical and observational studies published between 2020 and 2024. Studies evaluating the association between OSA and diabetes, including its effects on glycemic control, diabetic complications, and treatment outcomes, were included. <b>Results</b>: Thirty-three studies met our inclusion criteria. OSA is independently associated with impaired glucose metabolism, increased insulin resistance, and a higher risk of diabetic complications, including nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy has shown variable effects on metabolic outcomes, largely dependent on adherence. Traditional OSA severity metrics, such as the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), did not consistently predict metabolic burden. Factors such as sleep quality, nocturnal hypoxemia, and comorbid insomnia have emerged as the most relevant predictors. Sex-specific differences and the roles of pharmacological and behavioral interventions were also noted. <b>Conclusions</b>: OSA is a modifiable and under-recognized risk factor for poor glycemic control and diabetes complications. Routine screening and individualized treatment strategies are warranted, particularly for patients with T2DM and suboptimal metabolic control. Future research should focus on defining the phenotypes at the greatest risk and developing integrated treatment pathways.",Journal of clinical medicine,2025,Desiderio Passali; Luisa Maria Bellussi; Mariaconsiglia Santantonio; Giulio Cesare Passali
40565866,"Mental Health and Kidneys: The Interplay Between Cognitive Decline, Depression, and Kidney Dysfunction in Hospitalized Older Adults.","<b>Background:</b> As societies rapidly age, the prevalence of mental health disorders and chronic kidney disease (CKD) is simultaneously rising, and data on the link between these conditions remain inconclusive. This study aimed to investigate the associations among cognitive impairment, depression, and kidney involvement in elderly patients. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional analysis was conducted among hospitalized patients aged ≥65 years. Standardized tools such as the geriatric depression scale (GDS) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were used to assess depression and cognitive impairment, and kidney function was evaluated using eGFR and albuminuria. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to identify associations. <b>Results:</b> The study population consisted of 719 participants with a median age of 80 years. Kidney and mental health issues were highly prevalent: CKD was identified in 59.4%, cognitive impairment in 74%, and depression in 61.9% of patients. Patients with CKD were older and exhibited lower MoCA scores (<i>p</i> = 0.001), higher GDS scores (<i>p</i> = 0.007), reduced albumin (<i>p</i> < 0.001), lower hemoglobin levels (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and elevated C-reactive protein (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Increased albuminuria was associated with poorer cognition (<i>p</i> < 0.001) but showed no correlation with GDS scores. Additionally, worse cognitive scores (<i>p</i> = 0.001) and increased depression symptoms (<i>p</i> < 0.001) were correlated with declining estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). <b>Conclusions:</b> Cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms are highly prevalent among elderly hospitalized patients. Cognitive decline correlates with increased albuminuria and reduced eGFR, while depression worsens with declining kidney function.

40565848,Anxiety in Portugal: Associated Factors in Adult Population from 2011 to 2021.,"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent mental illnesses worldwide and in Portugal, often resulting in chronicity and disability. The objective of this study is to evaluate the sociodemographic and health-related factors associated with anxiety in the Portuguese adult population. <b>Methods</b>: This study included participants aged 18 to 65 years from the nationwide, population-based EpiDoC cohort, who were followed from 2011 to 2021 (n = 2927). Anxiety was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). A mixed logistic regression analysis was performed using a prospective analytical approach. Two strategies were used to adjust the mixed models: (i) model with only complete observations (n = 1950) and (ii) model with imputation of the category ""No"" in missing self-reported diseases (n = 2554). <b>Results</b>: The proportion of anxiety symptoms decreased from 2011-2013 to 2021 (12.5% vs. 8.5%). Experienced anxiety symptoms were positively associated (<i>OR</i> > 1, <i>p</i> < 0.05) with being female; having a high school, 2nd and 3rd cycle (6-9 years of studies), or primary/no education; being unemployed; seeking the first job; and not working or being temporarily unable to work. Additionally, anxiety symptoms were positively associated (<i>OR</i> > 1, <i>p</i> < 0.05) with smoking daily, lack of physical exercise, and medication use. Digestive diseases, multimorbidity, and region were also positively associated (<i>OR</i> > 1, <i>p</i> < 0.05) with anxiety symptoms. Moreover, age was negatively associated (<i>OR</i> < 1, <i>p</i> < 0.05) with experiencing anxiety symptoms. <b>Conclusions</b>: Some determinants are modifiable and preventable through economic, social, and health policies. Measures to promote healthy lifestyles, like physical exercise, reduce substance abuse, prevent chronic diseases, increase employability, and increase schooling and health literacy, are necessary to reduce the anxiety rate in Portugal.",Journal of clinical medicine,2025,Ana Pedro Costa; Anabela Afonso; Irma da Silva Brito; Teresa Dionísio Mestre; Ana Matos Pires; Manuel José Lopes
40565801,"Alcohol-Related Hospitalizations Among Adolescents and Young Adults with Type 1 Diabetes in Spain, 2016-2023.","<b>Background/Objectives:</b> We aim to describe and analyze the clinical characteristics and hospital outcomes of alcohol-related hospital admissions (ARHAs) among adolescents and young adults (12 to 35 years) with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in Spain from 2016 to 2023. We also aim to determine factors associated with admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). <b>Methods</b>: A descriptive observational study was carried out based on the Spanish Hospital Discharge Database (SHDD). ICD-10 codes were used to identify ARHAs in T1D patients. Joinpoint regression was used to analyze the time trend, and multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify predictors of ICU admission. <b>Results</b>: We recorded 39,091 discharges with T1D (52.59% females); of these, 1274 (3.26% prevalence) were identified as ARHAs (74.10% males vs. 25.90% females). Joinpoint regression showed a significant increase among females and stable prevalence in males. Females with T1D and ARHAs were younger than males, and more frequently had diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), mental disorders, and external causes of morbidity and mortality, whereas greater drug use was detected among males. Overall, 20.80% of ARHAs required ICU admission. Predictors of ICU admission included DKA, drug use, hypoglycemia, and female sex (OR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.02-1.90). <b>Conclusions</b>: The frequency of ARHAs in young people with T1D in Spain rose between 2016 and 2023, mainly owing to the increase in the percentage of females requiring ARHA. DKA and drug and tobacco consumption were very common in ARHAs. Admission to the ICU is frequent, increases over time, and is associated with female sex, DKA, hypoglycemia, and drug use.",Journal of clinical medicine,2025,Lucia Jiménez-Sierra; Ana López-de-Andres; Valentín Hernández-Barrera; Rodrigo Jiménez-Garcia; David Carabantes-Alarcon; Andrés Bodas-Pinedo; Elena Labajo-Gonzalez; José J Zamorano-León
40565782,Burnout or Depression? Investigating Conceptual and Empirical Distinctions in a High-Stress Occupational Group.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Despite 50 years of research, there is still no consensus on whether burnout and depression are distinct constructs within the domain of occupational psychopathology. The overarching aim of this study was to address the question of whether burnout and depression represent manifestations of the same phenomenon, based on data collected from a sample of police officers working in Central Europe. <b>Methods:</b> The participants included a representative group of Polish police officers. They were selected using a probabilistic (random) sampling method. Correlational analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between burnout (including the dimensions of exhaustion and disengagement) and depression. <b>Results:</b> The results indicated that although burnout and depression are closely related, they are not identical phenomena. This conclusion was further supported by the results of confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs), which demonstrated that the dimensions of disengagement and exhaustion did not overlap with the construct of depression. <b>Conclusions:</b> As psychiatrists have observed, individuals diagnosed with burnout often also meet criteria for mental disorders such as somatoform, affective, or anxiety disorders. As psychologists, we may continue to debate whether burnout and depression are conceptually equivalent; however, it remains equally important to provide support to police officers experiencing burnout and/or depression.",Journal of clinical medicine,2025,Łukasz Baka; Monika Prusik; Krzysztof Grala
40565777,Photogrammetry in Spinal Assessment: A Comparative Analysis with Traditional Clinical Methods.,"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Spine mobility is essential for overall health and daily functioning. Accurate assessment of spinal mobility is necessary for diagnosing and managing orthopedic, neurological, and rheumatological disorders, particularly in patients experiencing lower back and thoracic pain. The present study evaluates the effectiveness of traditional clinical tests in comparison to the innovative photogrammetric 3D posture assessment for evaluating spinal mobility. <b>Methods</b>: A total of 20 patients from a medical clinic underwent tests to measure lumbar and thoracic spine mobility, including flexion, lateral incline, and axial rotation, using both conventional and 3D posture assessment methods. <b>Results</b>: We found strong correlations between investigated methods, which recommends photogrammetry as a reliable and effective tool for assessing posture in clinical practice. Furthermore, 3D posture assessment offers a faster approach (clinical evaluation: 2:59 ± 0.22 min vs. photogrammetry: 1:03 ± 0.01 min) and a more practical method for assessing spinal mobility, thereby enhancing the patient experience and providing clinicians with objective data for treatment planning. <b>Conclusions</b>: The study highlights the value of modern technologies in clinical assessment and therapeutic intervention, encouraging therapists to integrate photogrammetric methods into their daily practice to improve patient outcomes.",Journal of clinical medicine,2025,Nicolae-Adrian Jurjiu; Ciprian Glazer; Mihaela Oravitan; Corina Pantea; Claudiu Avram
40565767,Use of Non-Pharmacological Approaches for Migraine Treatment: Results from the Migraine in Aotearoa New Zealand Survey.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Migraine is a common neurological disease with a high disability burden. Despite this, many people with migraine do not take medication to prevent attacks, even when this is indicated. Many non-pharmacological approaches to migraine treatment exist, but little is known about how people with migraine use these options. <b>Methods:</b> The online Migraine in Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ) Survey collected responses from 530 people with migraine from August to October 2022. Questions included current and previous use of preventive medications, supplements (e.g., magnesium, riboflavin, coenzyme Q10) and complementary therapies (e.g., meditation, biofeedback, yoga, acupuncture). <b>Results:</b> Around half of the respondents were currently using a supplement, 58% were currently using complementary therapy and half were taking preventive medication. One in five were using all three approaches for migraine prevention. Of those not taking preventive medication, 44% were taking a supplement, and 53% were using complementary therapy. For commonly used non-pharmacological approaches, 20-30% of people had tried them in the past but stopped due to lack of efficacy or other reasons. A high proportion of people would like to try approaches that are not readily available or expensive in NZ (e.g., neurostimulation devices and biofeedback). <b>Conclusions:</b> The use of supplements and complementary therapies for migraine prevention is common, often in combination with medication. There are high levels of discontinuation due to ineffectiveness and cost prohibits use for many. Improved access to non-pharmacological therapies, particularly as an adjunct, has the potential to improve outcomes for people with migraine, but more and better migraine treatment options are also needed.",Journal of clinical medicine,2025,Fiona Imlach; Susan Garrett
40565663,Tea and Its Active Ingredients in Preventing and Alleviating Depression: A Comprehensive Review.,"<b>:</b> Depression, commonly known as unipolar affective disorder, is one of the most prevalent mental illnesses in contemporary society, affecting individuals to varying degrees. Tea is one of the three major non-alcoholic beverages globally; it has a rich history of consumption and is associated with numerous health and nutritional benefits. This review systematically summarizes the antidepressant effects of various bioactive compounds found in tea, drawing upon research findings in the field of tea's functional health. It elucidates the impact of tea's bioactive components on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the nervous system, the immune system, intestinal microflora, and the monoaminergic system, among other physiological sites, to achieve antidepressant effects. These effects primarily involve enhancing neural signaling pathways, regulating neural signaling molecule levels, and reducing neuroinflammation. Tea may normalize the body's nervous system by bolstering immune function, alleviating or eliminating cellular inflammation to maintain healthy homeostasis, or improving intestinal flora and mitigating stress to prevent or treat depressive disorders. Additionally, the potential social support derived from tea-drinking activities, such as cultural rituals and interpersonal communication, may contribute to its antidepressant effects. This review discusses and analyzes the current research status regarding the antidepressant effects of tea and highlights that tea and its active ingredients can be utilized to prevent and alleviate depression.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Shuangling Xiao; Yi Li; Haiyan Jiang; Sitong Hou; Yaoyao Wang; Di Wang; Jie Teng
40565606,Results of Chromosomal Microarray Need to Always Be Checked by (Molecular) Cytogenetics-Even If They Seem to Be Simple Deletions.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Chromosome microarrays (CMAs) tend to be used as the first line test or as a test that does not require confirmation or verification by a second test. However, to understand the implications of a duplication or deletion for a family seeking genetic counseling, it is crucial to know the nature of the underlying chromosomal rearrangement. Here, we present seven cases with apparent isolated copy number loss, five of which showed unexpected complexity. <b>Methods:</b> Seven cases were investigated by CMA due to intellectual disability and/or dysmorphic features. Isolated deletions ranging in size from ~0.6 to ~21 Mb were found and referred for further characterization of the underlying chromosomal rearrangement. To elucidate the cases, fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed using locus-specific, whole and partial chromosome painting and/or multicolor banding. <b>Results:</b> Among the seven selected cases, there were five with unexpected complexity. Isolated deletions were actually evidence of chromoanasynthesis, ring chromosome formation, unbalanced translocation, or unbalanced insertion. <b>Conclusions:</b> These results clearly underscore that it seems reasonable to examine every case with a copy number variant-even if it appears to be ""only"" a simple partial deletion-using banding and/or molecular cytogenetic testing in order to make a qualified assessment of the situation and, on this basis, ensure sound genetic counseling.",Genes,2025,Thomas Liehr; Sylke Singer; Ulrike Mau-Holzmann; Stefanie Kankel; Niklas Padutsch; Luisa Person; Eva Daumiller; Uwe Kornak
40565604,Incidence of Homozygous <i>SMN2</i> Deletion in Japan: Cross-Reactivity of <i>SMN2</i> Primers with <i>SMN1</i> Sequence Causes False Negatives in Real-Time PCR Screening.,"<b>Background</b>: <i>SMN1</i> and <i>SMN2</i> are causative and modifier genes, respectively, for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The incidence of <i>SMN1</i> homozygous deletion in Japan is 1 in 20,000. However, the incidence of <i>SMN2</i> homozygous deletion in Japan remains unknown. <b>Methods</b>: To clarify the incidence of homozygous <i>SMN2</i> deletion in Japan, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on dried blood spot (DBS) samples collected from newborns nationwide. Samples with positive or ambiguous results were retested using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and nucleotide sequence analysis. <b>Results</b>: Of the 1000 DBS samples that were screened using real-time PCR, 51 were positive. Retesting using PCR-RFLP analysis identified 10 false results: six false positives and four false negatives. Therefore, there were 49 true positives among the 1000 samples. Notably, nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the false negatives were caused by the cross-reactivity of <i>SMN2</i> primers with <i>SMN1</i> sequences. <b>Conclusions</b>: The incidence of homozygous <i>SMN2</i> deletion in Japan is approximately 1 in 20 people. This incidence is much higher than that of homozygous <i>SMN1</i> deletion and may reflect the vulnerability of the <i>SMN2</i> region. Importantly, the results of the present study suggest that false negatives in the screening process were caused by cross-reactivity with non-target gene sequences.",Genes,2025,Makoto Sakima; Yoshihiro Bouike; Shin-Ichi Wada; Masami Nakamae; Yoriko Noguchi; Ryosuke Bo; Hiroyuki Awano; Jumpei Oba; Hisahide Nishio
40565599,<i>MPDZ</i> Pathogenic Variants Cause Obstructive Ventriculomegaly Related to Diencephalosynapsis and Third Ventricle Atresia.,"Ventriculomegaly is the main prenatal imaging feature for diagnosing fetal central nervous system anomalies in humans. Many ventriculomegalies can be related to genetic causes, regardless of their imaging presentations. Among these, <i>MPDZ</i> variants have been reported to cause severe ventriculomegaly inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (OMIM#615219). Several hypotheses have been put forward linking <i>MPDZ</i> variants to ventriculomegaly, but the precise underlying mechanisms, in particular whether its origin is obstructive or non-obstructive, are yet to be elucidated. To address this question, we retrospectively analyzed pre- and postnatal neuro-imaging and neuropathological data for cases of ventriculomegaly in which <i>MPDZ</i> variants were found through exome or genome sequencing. We performed anti-MPDZ immunostaining on fetal brain samples. We analyzed six cases (four fetuses and two children) of ventriculomegaly of variable severities with <i>MPDZ</i> variants. The precise analysis of brain MRI data, corroborated by fetopathological examinations, demonstrated an obstructive pattern of ventriculomegaly upstream from partial fusion of the thalami, also called diencephalosynapsis, with partial atresia of the third ventricle, which could extend to Sylvius's aqueduct. The morphological analysis using targeted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropathological data allowed us to unravel the underlying mechanisms of congenital ventriculomegaly related to <i>MDPZ</i> variants.",Genes,2025,Sara Cabet; Jean-François Ghersi-Egea; Suonavy Khung-Savatovsky; Fabien Guimiot; Audrey Putoux; Isabelle Sabatier; Carla Fernandez; Laure Raymond; Jérémie Mortreux; Hélène Laurichesse Delmas; Fabrice Eric Cuillier; Fabien Ho; Gaetan Lesca; Jean-Luc Alessandri; Laurent Guibaud
40565597,Expansion of the Genotypic and Phenotypic Spectrum of <i>TCTN3</i>-Related Joubert Syndrome.,"Joubert syndrome (JS, MIM 213300) is a rare genetic condition characterized by respiratory control disturbances, abnormal eye movements, ataxia, cognitive impairment, and the notable agenesis of the cerebellar vermis. The molar tooth sign visible in magnetic resonance imaging of the brain serves as a diagnostic tool for JS. Variants in the <i>TCTN3</i> gene can lead to the development of several diseases, including JS type 18, Orofaciodigital syndrome IV, and Meckel-Gruber syndrome. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in a 49-year-old woman with JS characterized by severe intellectual disability, ataxic gait, agenesis of the cerebellar vermis leading to the molar tooth sign, dystonic movements, strabismus, and nystagmus. Moreover, the patient also showed a thickened corpus callosum. Molecular analysis through WES revealed the heterozygous variants c.182dup (p.G62Wfs*18) and c.1452+4del in the <i>TCTN3</i> gene, expanding our understanding of the genetic diversity and potential phenotypic implications associated with <i>TCTN3</i> variations. To our knowledge, this is the first patient with JS and a thickened corpus callosum. Moreover, a thickened corpus callosum has never been identified in patients with pathogenic variants of the <i>TCTN3</i> gene.",Genes,2025,Mariangela Lo Giudice; Eugenia Borgione; Marika Giuliano; Sandro Santa Paola; Francesco Domenico Di Blasi; Rosa Pettinato; Corrado Romano; Carmela Scuderi
40565582,"Deficiency in KPNA4, but Not in KPNA3, Causes Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder like Symptoms in Mice.","Nucleocytoplasmic transport is crucial for neuronal cell physiology and defects are involved in neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, but also in ageing. Recent studies have suggested, that the classic nuclear import factor adapters KPNA3 (also named importin alpha4) and KPNA4 (also named importin alpha3) could be associated with the development of motor neuron diseases, a condition specifically affecting the neurons projecting from brain to spinal cord or from spinal cord to the muscles. Here we set out to analyze the neuronal function of mice deficient in KPNA3 (<i>Kpna3</i>-KO) or KPNA4 (<i>Kpna4</i>-KO). The motoric abilities and locomotion at different time points in ageing were tested to study the role of these two genes on motor neuron function. While we did not find deficits related to motor neurons in both mouse models, we discovered a hypermotoric phenotype in KPNA4-deficient mice. Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is caused by a combination of genetic, environmental and neurobiological factors and a number of genes have been suggested in genome-wide association studies to contribute to ADHD, including <i>KPNA4</i>. Here we provide supportive evidence for KPNA4 as a candidate pathogenic factor in ADHD, by analysing <i>Kpna4</i>-KO mice which show ADHD-like symptoms.",Genes,2025,Franziska Rother; Amishaben R Parmar; Julia S Bodenhagen; Letizia Marvaldi; Enno Hartmann; Michael Bader
40565581,Mixed Segmental Uniparental Disomy of Chromosome 15q11-q1 Coexists with Homozygous Variant in <i>GNB5</i> Gene in Child with Prader-Willi and Lodder-Merla Syndrome.,"Uniparental disomy (UPD) refers to the condition in which both chromosomes (or part of chromosome) of a pair are inherited from the same parent. There are two types of UPD: uniparental isodisomy (both chromosomes inherited from one parent are identical copies) and uniparental heterodisomy (two different chromosomes are inherited from one parent). UPD presents two primary developmental risks: recessive trait inheritance or an imprinting disorder. These risks may coexist, leading to an ultra-rare comorbidity. Managing the comorbidities associated with rare diseases presents unique clinical challenges. The existence of such phenomena is evidenced by our case report of a boy who was ultimately diagnosed with two rare diseases: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), due to the maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 (UPD), and autosomal recessive Lodder-Merla type 1 syndrome, linked to a novel pathogenic variant in the G protein subunit β <i>5</i> (<i>GNB5</i>) gene, as detailed in this paper. An unusual or severe phenotype in a patient diagnosed with PWS should invariably prompt the consideration of a comorbid genetic disease attributable to genes located in the PWS critical region of chromosome 15q, or elsewhere on chromosome 15. In cases of epileptic encephalopathy with cardiac arrhythmia, prompt consultation with a cardiologist and comprehensive genetic testing are essential to reduce the risks associated with untreated arrhythmia and ensure the provision of appropriate and safe anti-epileptic therapy. The presented case provides further support for the hypothesis that uniparental disomy may serve as an underlying cause of Lodder-Merla syndrome. This underscores the significance of comprehensive genetic testing, encompassing parental testing and familial cascade testing (in selected cases where there is consanguinity, or the likelihood of close common ancestral background between partners) to establish the recurrence risk.",Genes,2025,Tomasz Marczyk; Maria Libura; Beata Wikiera; Magdalena Góralska; Agnieszka Pollak; Marlena Telenga; Rafał Płoski; Robert Śmigiel
40565571,Epigenetic Clocks and Their Prospective Application in the Complex Landscape of Aging and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Nowadays, scientists are making efforts to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the phenotypic changes underlying the aging process in order to develop favorable therapeutical interventions. Epigenetic modifications, in particular DNA methylation, play a crucial role in the aging process, and this parameter has been used to set epigenetic clocks, algorithms that predict an individual's biological age based on a defined set of CpGs. In this review, we focus on the most recent literature to discuss the use of epigenetic clocks in the context of cognitive decline and dysregulation of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related gene expression. We have summarized all published scientific papers in which epigenetic clocks have been applied to measure age acceleration in blood and brain specimens from patients affected with AD. Progressive age acceleration, consistent with a specific DNA methylation signature, was observed in patients affected by AD, and it was correlated with the onset of complex diseases, mitochondrial alterations, dementia and cognitive decline, even in the early stages of these conditions. The use of epigenetic clocks might be a valuable biomarker to enable an earlier identification of ideal measures to reverse modifications caused by aging and to mitigate multiple aspects of disease/aging mechanisms.",Genes,2025,Annamaria Cerantonio; Beatrice Maria Greco; Luigi Citrigno; Selene De Benedittis; Antonio Qualtieri; Raffaele Maletta; Alberto Montesanto; Giuseppe Passarino; Patrizia Spadafora; Francesca Cavalcanti
40565564,Auditory Event-Related Potentials in Two Rat Models of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: Evidence of Automatic Attention Deficits in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats but Not in Latrophilin-3 Knockout Rats.,"Variations of the latrophilin-3 (<i>Lphn3</i>) gene have been associated with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). To explore the functional influence of this gene, <i>Lphn3</i> knockout (KO) rats were generated and have thus far demonstrated deficits in ADHD-relevant phenotypes, including working memory, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. However, inattention remains unexplored. We assessed automatic attention in <i>Lphn3</i> KO (n = 19) and their control line (wildtype/WT, n = 20) through use of the following auditory event-related potentials (ERPs): P1, N1, P2, and N2. We also extended this exploratory study by comparing these same ERPs in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs, n = 16), the most commonly studied animal model of ADHD, to their control line (Wistar-Kyoto/WKY, n = 20). Electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded using subdermal needle electrodes at frontocentral sites while freely moving rats were presented with five-tone trains (50 ms tones, 400 ms tone onset asynchronies) with varying short (1 s) and long (5 s) inter-train intervals. Peak amplitudes and latencies were analyzed using GLM-mixed ANOVAs to assess differences across genotypes (KO vs. WTs) and strains (SHRs vs. WKYs). The KOs did not demonstrate any significant differences in peak amplitudes relative to the WT controls, suggesting that the null expression of <i>Lphn3</i> does not result in the development of inefficiencies in automatic attention. However, the SHRs exhibited significantly reduced peak P1 (and peak-to-peak P1-N1) values relative to the WKYs. These attenuations likely reflect inefficiencies in bottom-up arousal networks that are necessary for efficient automatic processing. Distinct findings between these animal models likely reflect differing alterations in dopamine and noradrenaline neurotransmission that may underlie ADHD-relevant phenotypes.",Genes,2025,Logan M Brewer; Jankiben Patel; Frank Andrasik; Jeffrey J Sable; Michael T Williams; Charles V Vorhees; Helen J K Sable
40565562,A Novel Recurrent 200 kb <i>CRYL1</i> Deletion Underlies DFNB1A Hearing Loss in Patients from Northwestern Spain.,"Pathogenic recessive <i>GJB2</i> variants are the main genetic cause of non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss. However, following <i>GJB2</i> testing, a significant proportion of deaf patients are only found to be heterozygous carriers of pathogenic <i>GJB2</i> alleles. Five large deletions not affecting <i>GJB2</i> but encompassing a minimal common 62 kb region within the neighbouring <i>CRYL1</i> gene have been described to cause loss of <i>cis GJB2</i> expression and, as a result, produce hearing loss when in <i>trans</i> with pathogenic <i>GJB2</i> variants. We describe the identification and characterization of a novel deletion of this type in deaf patients from northwestern Spain. We used panel NGS sequencing to detect the deletion, MLPA to validate it, whole-genome sequencing to map its breakpoints, PCR + Sanger sequencing to finely characterize it and triple-primer PCR to screen for it. We identified a novel 200 kb deletion spanning the whole <i>CRYL1</i> gene in two unrelated deaf patients from Asturias (in northwestern Spain) who were heterozygous for the pathogenic <i>GJB2</i> c.35delG variant. Although the large deletion was absent from gnomAD v4.1.0 and 2052 local control alleles, screening for it in 20 additional deaf carriers of monoallelic pathogenic <i>GJB2</i> variants detected it in another patient from Galicia (also in northwestern Spain). The novel deletion, termed del(200 kb)insATTATA, explained hearing loss in 3/43 (7%) deaf patients from our cohort that were otherwise heterozygous for pathogenic <i>GJB2</i> variants. This work highlights the importance of comprehensively testing all genomic regions known to be clinically relevant for a given genetic condition, including thorough <i>CRYL1</i> CNV screening for DFNB1A diagnostics.",Genes,2025,Guadalupe A Cifuentes; Marta Diñeiro; Alicia R Huete; Raquel Capín; Adrián Santiago; Alberto A R Vargas; Dido Carrero; Esther López Martínez; Beatriz Aguiar; Anja Fischer; Roland Rad; María Costales; Rubén Cabanillas; Juan Cadiñanos
40565557,The Complex Role of the miR-17-92 Cluster in Stroke: Mechanistic Insights and Biomarker Potential.,"Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with ischemic stroke (IS) accounting for approximately 85% of cases. Recent research has highlighted the critical role of microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNA molecules, in the pathogenesis of stroke. Among these, the miR-17-92 cluster and its paralogs have emerged as key regulators in the development of stroke pathology and the subsequent recovery processes. We emphasize their regulatory roles in key pathological processes, including inflammation, apoptosis, neuroprotection, and tissue repair. We provide an overview of these mechanisms to support the identification of novel miRNA-based therapeutic targets and to improve stroke diagnosis, treatment, and recovery strategies. Specific miRNAs, such as miR-19a, miR-18a, and miR-92a, contribute to processes including neurogenesis, axonal growth, and a reduction in neuronal apoptosis. The miR-17-92 cluster also offers potential therapeutic applications by targeting injury-induced pathways, such as modulating apoptosis, promoting axonal elongation, or inhibiting neurodegeneration. Preclinical studies have suggested their potential to enhance neural regeneration and promote functional recovery. Future research should further elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of the miR-17-92 members and their therapeutic potential to enhance stroke treatment strategies.",Genes,2025,Cornelia Braicu; Mihaela Molnar; Ekaterina Isachesku; Adrian Pană; Dafin Mureșanu; Stefan Strilciuc
40565550,Comparative Analysis of MBNL1 Antibodies: Characterization of Recognition Sites and Detection of RNA Foci Colocalization.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> MBNL1 is an RNA-binding protein involved in RNA metabolism, including splicing. It colocalizes with RNA foci, a pathological hallmark of myotonic dystrophy, and plays a central role in its disease mechanism. Moreover, MBNL1 has been implicated in other neuromuscular disorders and cancers. In these pathological and biochemical studies, the detection of MBNL1 using antibodies is essential. Given that MBNL1 has multiple splicing-derived isoforms, different antibodies may recognize distinct isoforms. This study aims to compare six commercially available antibodies regarding their specificity in Western blotting, colocalization with RNA foci, and suitability for immunoprecipitation. <b>Methods</b>: Western blot analysis was performed using MBNL1 isoforms and deletion mutants expressed in HEK293 cells, as well as endogenous MBNL1 from various cell lines. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunofluorescence (IF) were conducted in DM1 model cells and patient-derived fibroblasts to assess MBNL1 colocalization with RNA foci. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in HEK293 cells to evaluate antibody suitability for protein isolation. <b>Results</b>: Western blot analysis revealed that different antibodies target distinct regions of MBNL1, with three recognizing exon 3 and the remaining antibodies recognizing exon 4, exon 5, and exon 6, respectively. In the FISH-IF experiments, the clarity of RNA foci colocalization varied depending on the antibody used, with some antibodies failing to detect colocalization. The immunoprecipitation analysis showed that four antibodies were able to isolate endogenous MBNL1. <b>Conclusions</b>: This study clarifies the recognition properties and application suitability of MBNL1 antibodies, providing a valuable resource for research on MBNL1-related diseases and RNA metabolism.",Genes,2025,Yoshitaka Aoki; Ai Ohki; Motoaki Yanaizu; Yoshihiro Kino
40565537,Clinical Efficacy of Selumetinib in Alleviating Neuropathic Pain Associated with Plexiform Neurofibroma: A Case Series.,"<b>Background</b>: Selumetinib, an MEK inhibitor, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April 2020 and became reimbursable in Italy in January 2020, for treating patients aged ≥3 years with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) complicated by symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PNs). Selumetinib has been shown to effectively reduce the volume of target PNs and alleviate neuropathic pain even in long-term-treated patients. We report the impact of Selumetinib on pain in three NF1 cases with inoperable symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas. <b>Case Series</b>: Three patients with NF1 (aged 13-27 years) presented with symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) associated with severe neuropathic pain. Following selumetinib administration, a marked reduction in or disappearance of neuropathic pain was observed within a few weeks, allowing the complete discontinuation of pain therapy. Interestingly, pain recurred whenever selumetinib was temporarily suspended, requiring patients to resume analgesic therapy. <b>Conclusions</b>: Selumetinib treatment has been shown to effectively reduce neuropathic pain in patients with NF1. These findings represent a significant advancement in managing pain related to PNs and support its potential application in treating other forms of neuropathic pain.",Genes,2025,Giuseppina Miele; Irene Russo; Lorenzo Filipponi; Silverio Perrotta; Elisabetta Maida; Giulio Piluso; Mariarosa Anna Beatrice Melone; Claudia Santoro
40565534,Investigating the Role of <i>B9D1</i> in Meckel-Gruber Syndrome: A Case Report and Comprehensive Literature Review.,"Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS) is a rare autosomal recessive lethal ciliopathy, characterized by occipital encephalocele, cystic kidneys, and postaxial polydactyly, caused by mutations in different genes. Its significant genetic heterogeneity along with its clinical overlap with other ciliopathies makes early diagnosis essential for clinical management, accurate genetic counseling, and informing future reproductive decisions. This study aims to describe a prenatally diagnosed case carrying a homozygous <i>B9D1</i> variant and to examine the current literature on all variants reported in this gene associated with MKS. We comprehensively review the current literature on pathogenic <i>B9D1</i> variants implicated in this syndrome. Additionally, we describe a case, presenting multiple congenital anomalies suggestive of MKS, genetically diagnosed by clinical exome sequencing on chorionic villi. Occipital encephalocele and polycystic kidneys were revealed via ultrasound, thus suggesting MKS. Genetic testing identified the homozygous c.151T>C (p.Ser51Pro) variant in the <i>B9D1</i> gene, inherited from healthy parents. This case supports the pathogenicity of the homozygous <i>B9D1</i> c.151T>C variant and underscores the importance of timely prenatal assessment and targeted genetic testing for the detection of MKS risk in heterozygous subjects, enabling appropriate pregnancy management and informed reproductive choices.",Genes,2025,Gianluca Campobasso; Ludovica Mercuri; Francesca De Razza; Antonella Cosentino; Marta Mele; Antonella Monittola; Carmen Congedo; Maria Chiara Calò; Caterina Scalcione; Alessandro D'Amuri; Salvatore Mauro; Serena Lattante
40565533,Variant Ataxia-Telangiectasia Presenting as Tremor-Dystonia Syndrome in a Bulgarian Religious Minority.,"<b>Background:</b> Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in the <i>ATM</i> gene. Given the residual kinase activity and the type of <i>ATM</i> mutation, its clinical spectrum varies from a severe classic phenotype to a variant atypical form. <b>Material and methods:</b> This study included 28 patients belonging to four big Bulgarian Muslim pedigrees with tremor and dystonia. Whole-exome sequencing was performed in seven affected individuals from two unrelated pedigrees, followed by Sanger sequencing of the coding sequences and exon-intron borders of the <i>ATM</i> gene. <b>Results:</b> Twenty-four of the affected individuals were homozygous for c.8147T>C (p.Val2716Ala) in <i>ATM</i>, while four of the affected individuals were compound heterozygous. The targeted Sanger sequencing along the <i>ATM</i> gene revealed as a second mutation in three of the patients the splice-site variant c.4909+1G>A and in one patient a synonymous pathogenic variant with a splicing effect, c.3576G>A, p.Lys1192. The age at onset in our group varied between 14 days and 40 years. The main symptoms were dystonia and tremor, more prominent in the upper limbs and the neck, and dystonic dysarthria and dysphagia. The clinical course was very slowly progressive. Brain imaging was normal in the majority of the patients. <b>Conclusion:</b> Clinical features due to mutations in the <i>ATM</i> gene can be very broad. The disease may appear as dystonia, especially of early onset, without frank cerebellar involvement and also normal cerebral imaging. A-T should be considered in all patients with unexplained, even mild movement disorders and elevated α fetoprotein.",Genes,2025,Teodora Chamova; Tihomir Todorov; Paulius Palaima; Petya Yankova; Iliyana Pacheva; Ivan Ivanov; Bilyana Georgieva; Sylvia Cherninkova; Alexey Savov; Dora Zlatareva; Elisaveta Naumova; Albena Todorova; Albena Jordanova; Ivailo Tournev
40565532,Region-Based Analysis with Functional Annotation Identifies Genes Associated with Cognitive Function in South Asians from India.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> The prevalence of dementia among South Asians across India is high among those who are 65 years and older, yet little is known about genetic risk factors for dementia in this population. <b>Methods:</b> Using whole-genome sequence data from 2680 participants from the Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia for the Longitudinal Aging Study of India (LASI-DAD), we performed a gene-based analysis on the missense/loss-of-function (LoF) and brain-specific promoter/enhancer variants of 84 genes, previously associated with AD in European Ancestry (EA). These analyses were performed separately, both with and without incorporating additional annotation weights (e.g., deleteriousness, conservation scores), using the variant-Set Test for Association using Annotation infoRmation (STAAR). We investigated associations with the Hindi Mental State Examination (HMSE) score and factor scores for general cognitive function and five cognitive domains. <b>Results:</b> In the missense/LoF analysis, without annotation weights and controlling for age, sex, state/territory, and genetic ancestry, three genes were associated with at least one measure of cognitive function (FDR q < 0.1). <i>APOE</i> was associated with four measures of cognitive function, <i>PICALM</i> was associated with HMSE score, and <i>TSPOAP1</i> was associated with executive function. The most strongly associated variants in each gene were rs429358 (<i>APOE</i> ε4), rs779406084 (<i>PICALM</i>), and rs9913145 (<i>TSPOAP1</i>). Rs779406084 is a rare missense mutation that is enriched in LASI-DAD compared to EA (minor allele frequency = 0.075% vs. 0.0015%). <b>Conclusions:</b> Missense/LoF variants in some genes previously associated with AD in EA are associated with measures of cognitive function in South Asians from India.

40565527,Retinal Changes in Early-Onset cblC Methylmalonic Acidemia Identified Through Expanded Newborn Screening: Highlights from a Case Study and Literature Review.,"Methylmalonic acidemia combined with homocystinuria (cblC) can lead to infantile maculopathy. Although significant visual deterioration is commonly reported in early-onset cblC, we found poor awareness regarding formal assessments of ocular complications, especially in newborns, and of how these complications relate to the timing of therapy initiation. In this work, we present our experience and perform a literature review. We performed sequential fundus examinations, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and full-field electroretinography (ERG) under sedation following detection of signs of retinal degeneration. We also assessed visual fields using kinetic attraction perimetry. We report a newborn who was referred on the eighth day of life, following a diagnosis of cblC through newborn screening (NBS), and who began treatment that same day. Close monitoring of retinal changes through fundus examinations allowed the detection of signs of retinal degeneration at 3 months, which progressed when checked at 5 months. At 7 months, OCT showed retinal thinning with the appearance of bull's eye maculopathy in the corresponding region on fundoscopy; ERG revealed a reduction in the amplitude of both scotopic and photopic components, whereas kinetic attraction perimetry showed no abnormalities. Genetic investigation confirmed the disease, compound heterozygous for a nonsense variant in <i>MMACHC</i> and a splicing one in <i>PRDX1</i>. In cblC, retinal degeneration occurs in the first months of life despite timely treatment and adequate biochemical control, and it may manifest before any signs of visual deprivation appear. However, there is an early, narrow window during which therapy may slow down retinal degeneration enough to prevent sensory nystagmus. We recommend initiating therapy immediately after biochemical diagnosis, along with close ophthalmological monitoring, before the appearance of any signs.",Genes,2025,Paola Michieletto; Francesco Baldo; Maurizio Madonia; Luisa Zupin; Stefano Pensiero; Maria Teresa Bonati
40565523,Phase Determination and Demonstration of Parental Mosaicism of Intragenic <i>PRKN</i> Deletions Initially Identified by Chromosomal Microarray Analysis.,"Autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinson disease (ARJP) is an early-onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by Parkinsonian motor symptoms with slow progression and preserved cognition. Biallelic pathogenic variants within the <i>PRKN</i> gene are associated with ARJP. Among <i>PRKN</i> pathogenic variants, deletions are a frequent occurrence and may be identified through chromosomal microarray testing. Here we present a case with two intragenic <i>PRKN</i> deletions initially identified as a secondary finding using chromosomal microarray. One deletion was paternally inherited and the second initially appeared to be de novo. In addition to microarray which initially identified the two deletions, long-range GAP-PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to further characterize the de novo deletion and phase of the deletions. Molecular characterization of the apparently de novo deletion demonstrated low-level maternal mosaicism of this deletion, thus proving that these deletions are in trans in the proband, yielding a diagnosis of autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinson disease. This case highlights the utility of a diagnostic approach combining microarray, long-range PCR, and Sanger sequencing to establish the phase and confirm biallelic <b><i>PRKN</i></b> deletions in a patient with ARJP. Furthermore, these findings highlight the importance of investigating the possibility of parental mosaicism to determine the phase of autosomal recessive variants and establish accurate recurrence risks.",Genes,2025,Lauren A Choate; Francis Hoffman; Jessica H Newman; Cassandra Runke; Matthew Webley; Nicole L Hoppman; Erik C Thorland
40565516,Clinical and Genetic Spectrum of Patients with Pediatric-Onset Epilepsy: Insights from a Single-Center Study.,"<b>Objective:</b> Epilepsy, a common neurological disorder marked by recurrent seizures often starting in childhood, has a complex etiology. Advances in high-throughput sequencing now confirm that 70-80% of cases have a genetic basis. Accordingly, this study aims to evaluate the clinical relevance of genetic variations detected through epilepsy panels and whole exome sequencing (WES) in pediatric-onset epilepsy patients. <b>Methods:</b> For this study, we enrolled a cohort of pediatric patients involving 205 subjects with a preliminary diagnosis of epilepsy. Targeted next-generation sequencing panels for epilepsy and whole exome sequencing was performed using the NextSeq 500 platform. The results were analyzed with the QIAGEN Clinical Insight bioinformatic platform and were further confirmed and approved by the Human Genome Mutation Database and ClinVar databases. <b>Results:</b> In this study, an epilepsy panel was conducted in 138 patients, and whole exome sequencing was performed in 67 patients. No clinically relevant variants were identified in 29 (21.0%) patients who underwent the epilepsy panel and 27 (40.3%) patients who underwent WES. Variants were detected in 128 different genes in the epilepsy panel group and in 54 different genes in the WES group, with the frequency of these variants limited to one or two patients. <b>Significance:</b> In both the epilepsy panel and WES groups, variants in sodium channel proteins, specifically in the SCN1A, SCN8A, and SCN9A genes, were found to have a high frequency. Collectively, these findings suggest that sodium channel proteins may play an important role in epilepsy.",Genes,2025,Hilmi Tozkir; Semih Asikovali; Esra Bozgeyik; Gurkan Gurbuz
40565515,The Role of Non-Coding RNAs in ALS.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, and eventually death. The pathogenesis of ALS is influenced by genetic factors, environmental factors, and age-related dysfunctions. These factors, taken together, are responsible for sporadic cases of ALS, which account for approximately 85-90% of ALS cases, while familial ALS accounts for the remaining 10-15% of cases, usually with dominant traits. Despite advances in understanding and studying the disease, the cause of the onset of ALS remains unknown. Emerging evidence suggests that non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of the disease. An abnormal expression of these molecules is implicated in various ALS-related processes, including motor neuron survival, protein aggregation, and inflammation. Here, we describe the dysregulation of non-coding RNAs in the pathogenic mechanism of ALS, highlighting the potential roles of miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs as biomarkers or therapeutic targets to examine the progression of the disease.",Genes,2025,Alessandra Falduti; Adele Giovinazzo; Elisa Lo Feudo; Valentina Rocca; Filippo Brighina; Angela Messina; Francesca Luisa Conforti; Rodolfo Iuliano
40565514,Decoding Neuromuscular Disorders: The Complex Role of Genetic and Epigenetic Regulators.,"Neuromuscular disorders (NMDs), such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and muscular dystrophies (e.g., Duchenne muscular dystrophy, DMD), are primarily driven by genetic mutations but are critically modulated by epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNA activity. These epigenetic processes contribute to phenotypic variability and disease progression, and emerging evidence suggests that environmental factors, particularly nutrition and exercise, may further influence the molecular pathways that modulate these diseases. Dietary bioactive compounds (e.g., polyphenols and omega-3 fatty acids) exhibit epigenetic modulatory properties, which could mitigate oxidative stress, inflammation, and muscle degeneration in NMDs. For example, the inhibition of DNMTs and HDACs by curcumin in ALS models and the promyogenic effects of green tea catechins in DMD suggest plausible, though still requiring investigation, therapeutic avenues. However, the clinical application of nutriepigenetic interventions is preliminary and requires further validation. This review examines the interaction of genetic and epigenetic factors in ALS, SMA, and muscular dystrophies, highlighting their combined role in the heterogeneity of these diseases. Integrative therapeutic strategies combining gene therapies, epigenetic modulators, and lifestyle interventions may offer a multidimensional approach to the management of NMD. A deeper understanding of these interactions will be essential for advancing precision medicine and improving patient outcomes.",Genes,2025,Bladimir Roque-Ramírez; Karla Estefanía Ríos-López; Luz Berenice López-Hernández
40565488,IL-6 Expression and the Confidence Interval-Based Estimation of Relevance (CIBER) Help Identify Persistent Inflammation and Cognitive Parameters of Executive Dysfunction in the Withdrawal Phase of Male Polydrug Abusers.,"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Individuals diagnosed with substance use disorders (SUD) exhibit notable deficits in executive function (EFs). Notably, the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been associated with cognitive impairments in individuals with substance use disorders. The specific neuropsychological parameters most affected by executive dysfunction remain poorly understood. <b>Methods</b>: In this study, sixteen patients diagnosed with SUD in the withdrawal phase were compared to twenty age-matched control subjects to ascertain which aspects of EFs were most adversely impacted. Plasma levels of IL-6 were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Data were analyzed using the Confidence Interval-Based Estimation of Relevance (CIBER) model to determine the most sensitive executive performance indicators. <b>Results</b>: Findings from the CIBER analysis revealed that the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test yielded the most pronounced cognitive discrepancies between males with and without SUD diagnoses. Elevated levels of IL-6 and associated executive dysfunction were observed to persist in males with SUD throughout the withdrawal phase. <b>Conclusions</b>: Notably, cognitive flexibility emerged as the most sensitive parameter indicative of executive dysfunction, suggesting its potential utility in tailoring clinical interventions for SUD patients during this critical recovery period.","Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Jesua Guzmán-González; Alma Galvez-Contreras; Israel Jimenez-Navarro; Iris Perez-Alcaraz; Oscar Gonzalez-Perez; Rocio E Gonzalez-Castañeda
40565480,Digitalization in Dentistry: Dentists' Perceptions of Digital Stressors and Resources and Their Association with Digital Stress in Germany-A Qualitative Study.,"<b>Background</b>: The digital transformation in dentistry is increasingly reshaping treatment procedures, offering new opportunities and advancements. While digitalization promises enhanced efficiency and quality of care through the standardization, acceleration, and simplification of workflows, it also introduces challenges related to mental health. Studies investigating digitization-associated stressors and resources, as well as health- and work-related outcomes, in the dental sector are still rare. In the context of ongoing digitalization, further studies are needed to examine the need for and the current status of the implementation of measures preventing techno-stress and stress-related outcomes. This study explores the use of digital tools in dental practices and their relationship to the techno-stress among German dentists. It identifies key stressors and resources associated with digital technologies, aiming to inform preventive measures, as well as training and support strategies to mitigate digital stress. <b>Methods</b>: A qualitative study was employed, involving ten problem-centered, guideline-based expert interviews with German dentists. The interviews were analyzed using MAXQDA software, following the focused interview analysis framework by Kuckartz and Rädiker. Coding and thematic analysis adhered to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) checklist and qualitative research quality criteria by Mayring. <b>Results</b>: This study identified a dual impact of digitalization in dentistry. On the one hand, digital tools significantly enhance workflow efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, and patient outcomes. On the other hand, they pose challenges like technostress, high financial costs, and the need for continuous learning. Findings reveal that the perceived usefulness of digital technologies is closely linked to the level of techno-stress experienced, while the amount, intuitiveness, and ease of use significantly influence stress levels. <b>Conclusions</b>: Digital transformation offers substantial benefits for dental practices but requires a balanced approach to implementation. Participants highlighted the need for proactive measures, such as targeted training, technical support, and stress-reducing interventions to reduce techno-stress levels. The digital transformation must be supported by coordinated efforts across academia, industry, and policy to strengthen digital competencies-creating a healthier, more resilient digital work environment. Future research should focus on the causal relationship between techno-stress and adverse long-term consequences, such as burnout or mental disorders, among dentists.","Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Julia Sofie Gebhardt; Volker Harth; David A Groneberg; Stefanie Mache

40565454,"Psychological Care Needs and Mental Health Service Use Among Adults with Diabetes: Evidence from the Diabetes, Distress, and Disparities (3D) Study.","Mental disorders and diabetes-related distress (DRD) are under-addressed aspects of person-centered diabetes care. This study examines the burden of depression, anxiety, and DRD among adults with type 1 (T1D), latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), type 2 (T2D), and gestational diabetes (GD), and explores their experiences and barriers in receiving mental health services. This study uses quantitative data from the 2023/24 Diabetes, Distress, and Disparities (3D) Study, which is based at a large US medical center. The 3D Study consists of 573 adults with diabetes (51.3% with T1D or LADA, 43.5% with T2D, and 4.4% with current/past GD). Mental health assessments included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (depression), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (anxiety), and Problem Areas in Diabetes-11 (DRD). Logistic regression was used to examine the prevalence of mental health concerns and behavioral service use. Overall, 14.5% had clinically significant depression, 8.0% had anxiety, and 23.6% had elevated DRD. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, and DRD had a positive, non-linear relationship with poor glycemic control. Approximately 30% of those with clinically significant emotional health concerns did not receive any behavioral health services in the past 12 months. Black adults were less likely to receive behavioral health treatment than non-Hispanic Whites (Odds Ratio = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.07-0.77). Common reasons for not receiving behavioral health services included not knowing where to go, cost, and lack of accessible providers. Gaps in addressing the emotional health needs of people with diabetes persist. Healthcare systems need to integrate addressing psychosocial factors as part of person-centered diabetes care.","Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Briana Mezuk; Kara M Mannor; Rebecca Hebert; Lauren Kouassi; Bella Flores; Emma Spring; Alejandro Rodríguez-Putnam
40565405,"The Impact of Mindfulness Programmes on Anxiety, Depression and Stress During Pregnancy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","Mental health problems that can appear in women during pregnancy include fear, anxiety, feelings of vulnerability, stress, and depression. Mindfulness (MF) is a specific meditation technique that can help during treatment for prenatal mood disorders, emotional distress, and psychological strains. The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a specific meditation approach in women during pregnancy on these mental health problems. This systematic review analysed data from PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL. The search equation used was ""mindfulness [title] AND pregnancy [title] AND (trial OR clinical trial OR RCT OR quasi-experimental OR experimental OR randomised clinical trial OR randomised controlled trial OR quasi-experimental study)"". This analyses experimental studies published in the last 10 years that include interventions based on MF, applying cognitive behavioural therapies to reduce stress, depression, and anxiety and in which the participants completed a questionnaire related to these variables. Standardised means effect size meta-analysis was performed with RevMan Web. All the included studies (n = 13) reported that the intervention led to a decrease in negative symptoms related to prenatal pressure, apprehension, and melancholy. The duration of the MF programmes was 6 to 8 weeks. The meta-analysis showed that MF during pregnancy is an effective approach, with a standardised mean difference of -0.73 for anxiety, -0.67 for depression, and -0.74 for stress.

40565369,Neurobiological Mechanisms of Electroconvulsive Therapy: Molecular Perspectives of Brain Stimulation.,"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains one of the most effective interventions for treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders, particularly major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. Despite extensive clinical and preclinical investigations, the precise neurobiological mechanisms underlying ECT's therapeutic effects are not fully understood. This review explores the molecular and cellular pathways involved in ECT, emphasizing its impact on neurotrophic signaling, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and neuroplasticity. Evidence suggests that ECT modulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor and other neurotrophic factors, promoting synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival. Additionally, ECT influences the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, reduces neuroinflammation, and alters neurotransmitter systems, contributing to its antidepressant effects. Recent findings also highlight the role of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress regulation in ECT-induced neural adaptation. By synthesizing current molecular insights, this review provides a comprehensive perspective on the neurobiological mechanisms of ECT, offering potential directions for future research and therapeutic advancements in brain stimulation.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Ermin Fetahovic; Vladimir Janjic; Maja Muric; Nemanja Jovicic; Branimir Radmanovic; Gvozden Rosic; Dragica Selakovic; Milos Filipovic; Nemanja Muric
40565362,Steroidomic Changes in the Cerebrospinal Fluid of Women with Multiple Sclerosis.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a long-term disease that causes inflammation and damage to the nervous system. This study evaluated steroidomic alterations related to MS in 57 female MS patients during the follicular phase and 17 during the luteal phase, as well as in age- and phase-matched controls. The data showed that (1) unconjugated and conjugated steroids were strongly linked between the blood and CSF. (2) MS patients have lower levels of unconjugated steroids compared to controls. However, unchanged levels of conjugated steroids suggest a possible increase in steroid sulfotransferase functioning. (3) MS patients show altered levels of steroids linked to 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1) function. While direct enzyme activity was not measured, disrupted cortisol biosynthesis-potentially linked to reduced functioning of both CYP11B1 and 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase-is associated with more severe cases of MS. (4) Reduced levels of 5α/β-steroids and protective GABAergic 3α-hydroxy-5α/β-steroids in MS patients might be linked to the pathophysiology of MS. (5) A potential increase in AKR1C3 function in MS could contribute to inflammation, as this enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of both steroids and prostaglandins. However, direct measurements of enzyme activity are needed to confirm this hypothesis. (6) Lower pregnenolone levels in MS patients might weaken neuroprotection, while higher pregnenolone sulfate levels could support cognitive function. (7) Lower levels of protective pregnenolone, DHEA, and androstenediol were associated with worse MS, suggesting these steroids may help shield against the disease.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Radmila Kancheva; Eva Kubala Havrdová; Marta Velíková; Ludmila Kancheva; Josef Včelák; Radek Ampapa; Michal Židó; Ivana Štětkářová; Tereza Škodová; Martin Hill
40565361,A Bridge Too Far? Towards Medical Therapy for Clinically Nonfunctioning Pituitary Tumors.,"Clinically nonfunctioning pituitary tumors (CNFPTs) typically do not cause hormonal excess, progress insidiously, and are often large and invasive at presentation. Complete resection is frequently not attainable; radiotherapy (RT) may effectively limit growth but carries a significant risk of hypopituitarism. Medical therapy with dopamine D2 receptor agonists and/or somatostatin analogs has been explored in CNFPTs but have yielded inconsistent results, and there is an unmet need for novel efficacious and safe medical therapies. The authors used the PubMed database to identify and review articles published from January 1982 to July 2024, that discussed the medical treatment of CNFPTs. The most commonly studied medical therapies were somatostatin receptor ligands (SRLs) and dopamine D2 receptor agonists. Of 111 patients with CNFPTs treated with SRLs, 31 (28%) exhibited tumor shrinkage. Following dopamine agonist treatment in 355 patients, tumor shrinkage occurred in 113 (32%), tumor stabilization in 182 (51%), and tumor growth in 60 (17%). The efficacy of other less commonly employed therapies such as GnRH analogs, PRRT, and temozolomide was also reviewed. Efficacious and safe medical therapies evaluated in robust randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials are needed to improve the management of CNFPTs.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Nikita Mogar; Dongyun Zhang; Anthony P Heaney
40565357,Analysis of the Expression Patterns of Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha Signaling Pathways and Regulatory MicroRNAs in Astrocytic Tumors.,"Chronic inflammation is increasingly recognized as a driver of glioma progression, with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) playing a central role in modulating the tumor microenvironment. This study aimed to investigate the expression profiles and regulatory mechanisms of TNF-α and its downstream mediators-including interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase 8 (MAP3K8), and Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase <i>7</i> (MAP2K7)-in astrocytic tumors of varying malignancy. We conducted an integrative molecular analysis of 60 human astrocytic tumor samples (20 G2, 12 G3, 28 G4) using transcriptomic microarrays, Reverse Transcription Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR), Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, methylation-specific PCR, and miRNA profiling. Prognostic associations were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analyses. TNF-α, IL-1β, and MAP3K8 were significantly upregulated in high-grade tumors, with log<sub>2</sub> fold changes ranging from 5.56 to 8.76 (<i>p</i> < 0.001). High expression of TNF-α (HR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.27-3.46, <i>p</i> = 0.004), IL-1β (HR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.45-3.82, <i>p</i> = 0.001), and MAP3K8 (Hazard Ratio; HR = 1.88, 95% confidence interval; 95% CI: 1.12-3.16, <i>p</i> = 0.015) was associated with poorer overall survival. miR-34a-3p and miR-30 family members, predicted to target TNF-α and IL-1β, were markedly downregulated in G3/G4 tumors (e.g., miR-30e-3p fold change: -3.78, <i>p</i> < 0.01). Promoter hypomethylation was observed in G3/G4 tumors, supporting epigenetic activation. Our findings establish a multi-layered regulatory mechanism of TNF-α signaling in astrocytic tumors. These data highlight the TNF-α/IL-1β/MAP3K8 axis as a critical driver of glioma aggressiveness and a potential therapeutic target.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Klaudia Skóra; Damian Strojny; Dawid Sobański; Rafał Staszkiewicz; Paweł Gogol; Mateusz Miller; Beniamin Oskar Grabarek
40565338,The Circadian Rhythm Gene Network Could Distinguish Molecular Profile and Prognosis for Glioblastoma.,"Increasing evidence highlights the role of aberrant circadian rhythm gene expression in glioblastoma (GBM) progression, but the impact of the circadian rhythm gene network on GBM molecular profiles and prognosis remains unclear. A total of 1042 GBM samples from six public datasets, TCGA and CGGA, were analyzed, with GBM samples stratified into three circadian core-gene patterns using unsupervised clustering based on the expression profiles of 17 circadian rhythm genes. The Limma R package identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among the three patterns, and a secondary clustering system, termed circadian-related gene pattern, was established based on DEGs. A circadian risk score was constructed using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression algorithm, and the efficiency of these patterns and the circadian risk score in distinguishing molecular profiles and predicting prognosis was systematically analyzed. The relationship between the circadian risk score and response to immune or targeted therapy was examined using the GSE78200 and IMvigor210 datasets. The results showed that GBM patients were clustered into three circadian core-gene patterns based on the expression profiles of 17 core circadian genes, with distinct molecular profiles, malignant characteristics, and patient prognoses among the patterns. Thirty-two DEGs among these patterns were identified and termed circadian-related genes, and secondary clustering based on these 32 DEGs classified GBM samples into two circadian-related gene patterns, which also predicted molecular profiles and prognosis. A circadian risk scoring system was established, allowing the calculation of individual risk scores based on the expression of 10 genes, where GBM patients with lower circadian risk scores had prolonged overall survival and less aggressive molecular subtypes, while higher circadian risk scores correlated with better responses to MAPK-targeted therapy. In conclusion, this study established two clustering patterns based on 17 circadian rhythm genes or 32 circadian-related genes, enabling the rapid classification of GBM patients with distinct molecular profiles and prognoses, while the circadian risk scoring system effectively predicted survival, molecular profiles, and therapeutic responses for individual GBM patients, demonstrating that the circadian rhythm gene network can distinguish molecular profiles and prognosis in GBM.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Fangzhu Wan; Zongpu Zhang; Jinsen Zhang; Jiyi Hu; Weixu Hu; Jing Gao; Minjie Fu; Yuan Feng; Lin Kong
40565322,An Experimental Rat Model for Simultaneous Induction of Peripheral Neuropathy and Myelotoxicity by Docetaxel Administration: Evaluating the Protective Role of Dimethyl Fumarate.,"Docetaxel is extensively used for treating different types of cancer; however, its clinical efficacy is primarily limited by myelotoxicity and peripheral neuropathy, adverse effects that often lead to treatment discontinuation. This study aimed to establish a preclinical model in Wistar rats for the simultaneous induction of myelotoxicity and peripheral neuropathy associated with docetaxel administration, enabling the evaluation of potential chemopreventive agents. Four distinct docetaxel administration schemes were assessed by performing behavioral nociceptive tests and complete blood cell counts. After establishing the damage model (5 mg/kg/week docetaxel for six weeks), we co-administered 100 mg/kg/week oral dimethyl fumarate to assess its protective effect. Dimethyl fumarate attenuated docetaxel-induced hyperalgesia, likely through preserving normal nerve fiber density in sciatic nerves, but neutropenia was not significantly mitigated. An alternative regimen with additional pre-administered doses of dimethyl fumarate showed a trend toward neutropenia attenuation and suggested an interesting inhibition of docetaxel-induced rat vibrissae loss. Chou-Talalay isobolographic analyses on prostate cancer cell lines revealed that dimethyl fumarate does not impair the therapeutic effect of docetaxel at most combination ratios evaluated; rather, synergistic effects were observed. This experimental model proved useful and will facilitate further research into the protective role of dimethyl fumarate and other potential chemoprotective agents.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Sebastian Cubides-Cely; Alexander David Castro; Pablo Prado-Guevara; Julio César Mantilla-Hernández; Mario Negrette-Guzmán
40565321,Myostatin Modulation in Spinal Muscular Atrophy: A Systematic Review of Preclinical and Clinical Evidence.,"Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disorder characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons and consequent muscle atrophy. Although SMN-targeted therapies have significantly improved survival and motor outcomes, residual muscle weakness remains a major clinical challenge, particularly in patients treated later in the disease course. Myostatin, a potent negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass, has emerged as a promising therapeutic target to address this gap. This review summarizes the preclinical and clinical evidence supporting the modulation of the myostatin pathway in SMA. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that inhibiting myostatin, especially when combined with SMN-enhancing agents, can increase muscle mass, improve motor function, and enhance neuromuscular connectivity in SMA mouse models. These findings provide a strong rationale for translating myostatin inhibition into clinical practice as an adjunctive strategy. Early clinical trials investigating myostatin inhibitors have shown favorable safety profiles and preliminary signs of target engagement. However, large-scale trials have yet to demonstrate widespread, robust efficacy across diverse patient populations. Despite this, myostatin pathway inhibition remains a compelling approach, particularly when integrated into broader treatment paradigms aimed at enhancing motor unit stability and function in individuals with SMA. Further clinical research is essential to validate efficacy, determine optimal timing, and define the patient subgroups most likely to benefit from myostatin-targeted therapies.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Martina Gnazzo; Giulia Pisanò; Valentina Baldini; Giovanna Giacomelli; Silvia Scullin; Benedetta Piccolo; Emanuela Claudia Turco; Susanna Esposito; Maria Carmela Pera
40565316,Twelve-Month CPAP Therapy Modulates BDNF Levels in Patients with Severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Implications for Metabolic and Treatment Compliance.,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and metabolic processes, including glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. In patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), recurrent episodes of intermittent hypoxia may stimulate BDNF expression as a compensatory neuroprotective response. OSA is associated with metabolic disturbances, such as increased insulin resistance and a higher risk of type 2 diabetes. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy may influence both BDNF levels and metabolic outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in BDNF concentration and glucose metabolism in patients with OSA, with particular emphasis on the effect of long-term CPAP therapy. Sixty-six adult patients with OSA confirmed by polysomnography were enrolled and divided into severe (s-OSA) and non-severe (ns-OSA) groups. Fasting blood samples were collected to measure glucose, insulin, and BDNF concentrations. Patients with s-OSA were re-evaluated after 12 months of CPAP therapy and further classified as compliant (sc-OSA) or non-compliant (snc-OSA) based on recorded device usage. The same biochemical parameters were assessed after the 12-month follow-up. Baseline BDNF levels were significantly higher in the s-OSA group compared to the ns-OSA group (20.1 ng/mL vs. 8.1 ng/mL, <i>p</i> = 0.02) and correlated with the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI, r = 0.38, <i>p</i> = 0.02). In the nsc-OSA group, BDNF concentrations increased significantly after 12 months (16.2 ng/mL vs. 35.5 ng/mL, <i>p</i> < 0.001), while no significant change was observed in the sc-OSA group (24.4 ng/mL vs. 27.4 ng/mL, <i>p</i> = 0.33). Among sc-OSA patients, a significant improvement in insulin resistance was noted, although no significant changes were observed in fasting glucose or insulin levels. Increased BDNF levels were observed in patients with s-OSA compared to ns-OSA. Compliant CPAP therapy was associated with reduced insulin resistance and no further BDNF increase, in contrast to non-compliance, suggesting a beneficial effect of CPAP on glucose metabolism and BDNF regulation. These findings support the hypothesis that both neurotrophic and metabolic responses in OSA may be modulated by disease severity and therapy adherence.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Urszula Karwowska; Aleksandra Kudrycka; Karol Pierzchała; Robert Stawski; Hanna Jerczyńska; Piotr Białasiewicz; Wojciech Kuczyński
40565303,Brain Endothelial Cells in Blood-Brain Barrier Regulation and Neurological Therapy.,"Brain endothelial cells (BECs) constitute the core component of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), regulating substance exchange between blood and the brain parenchyma to maintain central nervous system homeostasis. In pathological states, the BBB exhibits the disruption of tight junctions, endothelial cell (EC) damage, and increased permeability, accompanied by neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and abnormal molecular signaling pathways, leading to neurotoxic effects in the brain parenchyma and exacerbating neurodegeneration and disease progression. This review systematically summarizes the developmental origin, structural characteristics, and pathological mechanisms of BECs in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and glioblastoma with a particular focus on the regulatory mechanisms of the Wnt/β-catenin and VEGF signaling pathways. By integrating the latest research advances, this review aims to provide a comprehensive perspective for understanding the role of BECs in physiological and pathological states and to provide a theoretical basis for the development of BBB-based therapeutic approaches for neurological diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Yuqing Xiang; Qiuxiang Gu; Dong Liu
40565291,The Interplay Between Exosomes and Gut Microbiota in Neuroinflammation: A New Frontier in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition that is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β, the hyperphosphorylation of tau, and persistent neuroinflammation. However, these hallmarks alone do not fully capture the intricacies of AD pathology, thus necessitating the investigation of emerging mechanisms and innovative tools. Exosomes (nanoscale vesicles involved in cell communication and immune modulation) have emerged as pivotal cellular vehicles due to their dual role-both in the propagation of pathological proteins and the regulation of inflammatory responses. Furthermore, these vesicles have been demonstrated to play a crucial role in the mediation of the effects of microbiota-derived metabolites and the reflection of systemic influences such as dysbiosis, thereby establishing a link between the gut-brain axis and the progression of AD. A comprehensive narrative literature review was conducted using the following databases: ScienceDirect, Scopus, Wiley, Web of Science, Medline, and PubMed, covering studies published between 2015 and 2025. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were established to select research addressing exosomal biogenesis, their functional and diagnosis role, their therapeutic potential, and the emerging evidence on microbiota-exosome interplay in Alzheimer's disease. Exosomes have been identified as integral mediators of intercellular communication, reflecting the molecular state of the central nervous system. These particles have been shown to promote the propagation of pathological proteins, modulate neuroinflammatory responses, and serve as non-invasive biomarkers due to their detectability in peripheral fluids. Advances in exosomal engineering and microbiome-based interventions underscore the potential for targeting systemic and CNS-specific mechanisms to develop integrative therapies for AD. Exosomes present a promising approach for the early diagnosis and personalized treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, methodological challenges and ongoing controversies, including those related to the influence of systemic factors such as dysbiosis, necessitate multidisciplinary research to optimize and standardize these strategies.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Sara Uceda; Manuel Reiriz; Víctor Echeverry-Alzate; Ana Isabel Beltrán-Velasco
40565289,Dysregulation of Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatase OCRL in Alzheimer's Disease: Implications for Autophagy Dysfunction.,"Autophagy is impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly at the stage of autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Recent studies suggest that the inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase OCRL (Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome protein) is involved in this fusion process; however, its role in AD pathophysiology remains largely unclear. In this study, we investigated the localization and expression of OCRL in post-mortem AD brains and in a 5XFAD transgenic mouse model. While <i>OCRL</i> RNA levels were not significantly altered, OCRL protein was markedly reduced in the RIPA-soluble fraction and positively correlated with the autophagy marker Beclin1. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed OCRL immunoreactivity in neuronal cytoplasm, granulovacuolar degeneration bodies, and plaque-associated dystrophic neurites in AD brains. Furthermore, OCRL overexpression in a FRET-based tau biosensor cell model significantly reduced the tau-seeding-induced FRET signal. These findings suggest that OCRL dysregulation may contribute to autophagic deficits and the progression of tau pathology in AD.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Kunie Ando; May Thazin Htut; Eugenia Maria Antonelli; Andreea-Claudia Kosa; Lidia Lopez-Gutierrez; Carolina Quintanilla-Sánchez; Emmanuel Aydin; Emilie Doeraene; Siranjeevi Nagaraj; Ana Raquel Ramos; Katia Coulonval; Pierre P Roger; Jean-Pierre Brion; Karelle Leroy
40565282,ApoE Isoform-Dependent Effects on Extinction of Contextual Fear Memory and Passive Avoidance Memory.,"Following exposure to trauma, avoidance behavior can be protective but also contribute to severe symptoms and interfere with exposure-based therapy. Extinction of fear conditioning by exposure to the same environment or environmental cues that were present during the initial traumatic event but without including the aversive stimulus or stimuli is often used to study post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a condition characterized by an inability to suppress conditioned fear responses. A limitation of this paradigm is that one cannot avoid the context or cues associated with the initial traumatic event. In contrast, in the passive avoidance test, one can escape the environment associated with the aversive stimulus. Genetic factors might modulate the ability to extinguish fear memory. In this study, we compared the effects of distinct human apoE isoforms on the extinction of contextual fear and passive avoidance memory, as well as on subsequent activity levels, depressive-like behavior, and hippocampal levels of tau, in targeted replacement mice.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Elizabeth Saltonstall; Alexandra Pederson; Abigail O'Niel; Sarah Holden; Kat Kessler; Eileen Ruth Samson Torres; Jacob Raber
40565278,The Complex Etiology of Epilepsy: Genetic Analysis and HLA Association in Patients in the Middle East.,"Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders. Disease etiology and pathogenesis are still not well understood. Genetic mutations are associated with 70% of epilepsies, while 30% are still enigmatic. Attempting to close the knowledge gap, we performed genetic analysis of a cohort of patients from the Middle East and North Africa, both understudied and highly consanguineous populations. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was carried out on 81 patients and their family members at a tertiary center in Qatar. We found damaging mutations in half of the patients: 15 in known epilepsy genes, and 19 in contested or unknown genes. The mutations include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNVs), frameshifts, copy number variations (CNVs), and loss of homozygosity (LOH). Fifteen of the SNVs are novel, and seventeen are homozygous, reflective of the characteristics of the cohort. In addition, we used the WES data to type HLA alleles for 13 class I and II genes. We show that <i>DRB3*01:01:02G</i> is negatively associated with epilepsy, in contrast to <i>DRB4*01:01:01G</i>, which may be a risk allele. In addition to expanding the knowledge base of genes involved in epilepsy, our findings show that genetic predisposition, inclusive of immune genes, suggests a complex etiology.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Abeer Fadda; Mohamed Alsabbagh; Dhanya Vasudeva; Amira Saeed; Sara Aglan Tarek; Satanay Z Hubrack; Ruba Benini; Khaled Zamel; Bernice Lo
40565268,Pathological Alterations in Human Blood Microbiome-An Updated Review.,"The main source of microorganisms in the blood is the intestinal and oral microflora through the route of atopobiosis. It is clear that the blood microbiome undergoes significant changes in response to various pathological conditions within the human body. In this review, we summarized data from studies of the human blood microbiome in diseases of the nervous system and cardiovascular, respiratory, liver, kidney, and metabolite disorders. Links between the blood microbiome and the above mentioned diseases are demonstrated. In support of this understanding, it is evident that analogous alterations in microbiome composition occur across various disease categories; however, the microbial signatures associated with the blood microbiome exhibit specificity. For instance, an elevated abundancy of <i>Proteobacteria</i> has been identified in cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic disorders. Conversely, while <i>Firmicutes</i> are found to be abundant in renal and metabolic conditions, their levels are diminished in cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, patients suffering from respiratory and liver ailments typically show a heightened presence of <i>Bacteroidetes</i>; notably, <i>Flavobacterium</i> is prevalent in respiratory diseases, whereas <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> is associated with liver diseases. Hence, the human blood microbiome could be considered as a potential biomarker in certain diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Stela Dragomanova; Reni Kalfin; Lyubka Tancheva; Sidharth Mehan; Dana Stanciu; Stefan Panaiotov
40565265,Candidate Key Proteins of Tinnitus in the Auditory and Motor Systems of the Thalamus.,"To determine candidate key proteins involved in synaptic transmission in the thalamus in tinnitus, we used bioinformatic methods by analyzing protein-protein interaction networks under different conditions of acoustic activity. The motor system was used to analyze the specificity of the response reaction in the auditory system. The databases GeneCard, STRING-, DAVID-, and Cytoscape version 3.9.1 were applied to identify the top three high-degree proteins, their high-score interaction proteins and the gene ontology-biological processes (GO-BPs) associated in the thalamus with synaptic transmission in tinnitus. Under normal hearing conditions, a balanced state of functional connectivity was observed for both systems, the auditory system and the motor system of the thalamus. Under conditions of acoustic stimulation, the GO-BP-enrichment analyses suggest that in the auditory system, tinnitus-related proteins may be involved in responses typically associated with ""xenobiotic stimuli""; in the motor system, the activation of the dopaminergic system was observed. Under conditions of tinnitus in the auditory system, key proteins and the GO-BPs indicate the regulation of different developmental processes and regulation by microRNA transcription; in the motor system, tinnitus is also identified as ""xenobiotic"" but responded with GO-BPs, corresponding to various signaling systems, e.g., tachykinin. Key proteins and their interactions with neurotransmitter receptors may be useful indicators for tinnitus-associated changes in synaptic transmission in the thalamic auditory system.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Johann Gross; Marlies Knipper; Birgit Mazurek
40565264,Bioinformatics-Driven Multi-Factorial Insight into α-Galactosidase Mutations.,"Fabry disease is a rare genetic disorder caused by deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (AGAL), resulting in the accumulation of globotriaosylceramides (Gb3) in tissues and organs. This buildup leads to progressive, multi-systemic complications that severely impact quality of life and can be life-threatening. Interpreting the functional consequences of missense variants in the <i>GLA</i> gene remains a significant challenge, especially in rare diseases where experimental evidence is scarce. In this study, we present an integrative computational framework that combines structural, interaction, pathogenicity, and stability data from both in silico tools and experimental sources, enriched through expert curation and structural analysis. Given the clinical relevance of pharmacological chaperones in Fabry disease, we focus in particular on the structural characteristics of variants classified as ""amenable"" to such treatments. Our multidimensional analysis-using tools such as AlphaMissense, EVE, FoldX, and ChimeraX-identifies key molecular features that distinguish amenable from non-amenable variants. We find that amenable mutations tend to preserve protein stability, while non-amenable ones are associated with structural destabilisation. By comparing AlphaMissense with alternative predictors rooted in evolutionary (EVE) and thermodynamic (FoldX) models, we explore the relative contribution of different biological paradigms to variant classification. Additionally, the investigation of outlier variants-where AlphaMissense predictions diverge from clinical annotations-highlights candidates for further experimental validation. These findings demonstrate how combining structural bioinformatics with machine learning-based predictions can improve missense variant interpretation and support precision medicine in rare genetic disorders.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Bruno Hay Mele; Federica Rossetti; Giuseppina Andreotti; Maria Vittoria Cubellis; Simone Guerriero; Maria Monticelli
40565245,Oxidative Stress in Neurodegenerative Disorders: A Key Driver in Impairing Skeletal Muscle Health.,"The fine regulation of antioxidant systems and intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is responsible for cellular redox balance. The main organelles responsible for ROS production are mitochondria, and they complete this process through the electron transport chain. These potentially harmful molecules are buffered by enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems. Oxidative stress is determined by an imbalance between the production and clearance of ROS in favor of the accumulation of these detrimental species, which generate cellular damage by interacting with macromolecules. In neurodegenerative diseases, oxidative stress has been demonstrated to be a crucial component, both causal and consequential to the disease itself. On the other hand, neurodegeneration disrupts neuromuscular junctions, leading to reduced muscle use and subsequent atrophy. Additionally, systemic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction associated with neurodegenerative diseases exacerbate muscle degeneration. Thus, sarcopenia and atrophy are common consequences of neurodegeneration and play a significant role in these disorders. Regarding this, ROS have been defined as promoting sarcopenia, stimulating the expression of genes typical of this condition. Overall, this review aims to contribute to filling the gap in the literature regarding the consequences at the muscular level of the relationship between oxidative stress and neurodegenerative diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Serena Castelli; Emily Carinci; Sara Baldelli
40565243,Exploration of Bromodomain Proteins as Drug Targets for Niemann-Pick Type C Disease.,"Defects in lysosomal cholesterol handling provoke fatal disorders presenting neurovisceral symptoms with variable onset and life spans. A prime example is Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPCD), where cholesterol export from the endosomal-lysosomal system is impaired due to variants of either NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 1 (NPC1) or NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 2 (NPC2). Therapeutic options for NPCD are limited to palliative care and disease-modifying drugs, and there is a need for new treatments. Here, we explored bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins as new drug targets for NPCD using patient-derived skin fibroblasts. Treatment with JQ1, a prototype BET protein inhibitor, raised the level of NPC1 protein, diminished lysosomal expansion and cholesterol accumulation, and induced extracellular release of lysosomal components in a dose-, time-, and patient-dependent manner. Lastly, JQ1 enhanced and reduced cholesterol accumulation induced by pharmacologic inhibition of NPC1 and of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, respectively. Taken together, bromodomain proteins should be further explored as therapeutic drug targets for lysosomal diseases like NPCD, and as new components regulating lysosomal function and cholesterol metabolism.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Martina Parente; Amélie Barthelemy; Claudia Tonini; Sara Caputo; Alessandra Sacchi; Stefano Leone; Marco Segatto; Frank W Pfrieger; Valentina Pallottini
40565238,"Ex Vivo Osteoclastogenesis from Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells Is Unchanged in Adults with Phenylketonuria, Regardless of Dietary Compliance.","Pathogenic variants in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene can result in phenylalanine (Phe) accumulation leading to phenylketonuria (PKU; OMIM #261600), a metabolic disease diagnosed in newborn screening. Early treatment with a Phe-restricted diet prevents severe mental retardation. Next to several other health complaints, patients with PKU present with low bone mineral density (BMD) more often than the general population. The etiology of the phenotype is not yet fully understood, and current research focuses on improving special medical foods and changes in osteoclasts (OC) and osteoblasts. Analysis of osteoclastic and oxidative stress control gene expression next to the simple number of OC developing from peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs) in association with dietary compliance and BMD was therefore part of our analysis. PBMCs were obtained from 17 adults with PKU and 17 age- and sex-matched controls on the same day. PBMCs were differentiated into osteoclasts (OC, Trap-positive multi-nucleated cells (≥3 nuclei)) for 14 days by adding human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF) and receptor activator of NF-κB Ligand (RANKL). Subsequently, quantitative real-time PCR was performed on OC function and oxidative stress control. Data on dietary compliance during the previous 12 months and 5 years and BMD were collected. PBMCs from adults with PKU and controls were differentiated into comparable numbers of OC (PKU: 53 [17-87] vs. controls: 39 [19-52], <i>p</i> = 0.381) without differences in mRNA expression of genes related to OC function and oxidative stress control. Dietary compliance in short-term and mid-term was not associated with OC number or mRNA expression, but <i>CTSK</i> negatively correlated with BMD T-Score in the hips of adults with PKU (Spearman r = -0.518, <i>p</i> = 0.040). Osteoclastogenesis was not changed in adult patients with PKU, nor were most mRNA expressions of OC marker genes or those of oxidative stress control. However, 44% of patients presented with BMD below -1 in their hips, and the OC of these tended to express higher <i>CTSK</i> (above -1: 0.2 [0.2-0.8] vs. below -1: 0.9 [0.6-3.4], <i>p</i> = 0.055). Thus, alternative regulatory mechanisms of OC activity may play a role in the development of low BMD in patients with PKU.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Beatrice Hanusch; Anne Schlegtendal; Thomas Lücke; Kathrin Sinningen

40565209,Quercetin as a Therapeutic Option in a Rat Model of Aluminum Chloride- and D-Galactose-Induced Neurodegeneration.,"Aluminum (Al) is one of the most abundant metals on Earth and is well known as an environmental neurotoxic agent in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Aluminum toxicity is associated with oxidative stress, reduction of antioxidant enzymes, and disruption of the balance of cellular metals, such as iron (Fe), calcium (Ca), and copper (Cu), which causes structural and functional changes in the nervous tissue of the brain or peripheral nervous system. The intake of functional foods, rich in antioxidants, such as quercetin, may be beneficial in combating oxidative stress and neurodegenerative changes in the brain. The aim of this study was to provide deeper insight into the cellular and molecular neuroprotective effects of quercetin in regulating amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation, tau pathology, and neuroinflammation in the Al/D-galactose-induced rat model (Al/D-gal) of AD. The results showed that quercetin successfully modulated the impaired homeostatic and neuropathological consequences of aluminum chloride and D-galactose administration over 28 days: it directly protected neurons by regulating the level of oxidative stress and antioxidants, reduced Aβ aggregation by inhibiting the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), increased the survival, growth, and differentiation of nerve cells by maintaining the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and regulated microglial immunoreactivity and neuroinflammation by reducing the level of proinflammatory cytokines. The multiple effects confirm that quercetin can be applied as an alternative non-pharmaceutical approach in reducing Al-induced neurotoxicity and maintaining adaptive homeostasis, which consequently affects the functioning of the central nervous system and the whole organism.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Marina Kukolj; Nada Oršolić; Lea Langer Horvat; Barbara Nikolić; Tatjana Ocrt; Karmen Branović Čakanić; Romana Gračan; Ivana Zrinščak; Maja Jazvinšćak Jembrek; Goran Šimić
40565203,Luteolin Potentially Alleviates Methamphetamine Withdrawal-Induced Negative Emotions and Cognitive Deficits Through the AKT/FOXO1/HO-1 Signaling Pathway in the Prefrontal Cortex and Caudate Putamen.,"Methamphetamine (METH) misuse-induced affective and cognitive dysfunctions cause severe global health and economic burdens. However, the mechanisms underlying METH withdrawal-induced negative emotions and cognitive deficits, as well as the treatment strategies for them, remain elusive. Previous findings suggest that METH use triggers neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis, and protein kinase B (AKT), forkhead box protein 1 (FOXO1), and heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) are implicated in these processes. In the present study, we aimed to reveal the role and potential mechanisms of luteolin, a flavonoid phytochemical with anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties, in METH withdrawal-induced negative emotions and cognitive deficits. We found that prolonged METH withdrawal led to an increase in neuronal activity and a decrease in the protein expression of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) and HO-1 in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and caudate putamen (CPu). Luteolin pretreatment partially mitigated these METH withdrawal-induced negative emotions and cognitive deficits, and prevented the abnormal activation of PFC and CPu as well as the downregulation of AKT/HO-1 expression. Notably, we further observed that luteolin inhibited the METH-induced nuclear translocation of FOXO1. Our findings suggest that luteolin may alleviate METH withdrawal-induced affective and cognitive dysfunctions by reducing oxidative injury in the brain through the AKT/FOXO1/HO-1 pathway, highlighting its potential for treating drug addiction-related health issues.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Baoyao Gao; Ran An; Min Liang; Xinglin Wang; Jianhang Peng; Xingyao Chen; Zijun Liu; Tao Li; Xinshe Liu; Jianbo Zhang; Wei Han
40565183,Comparison of Cognitive Deterioration Between Propofol and Remimazolam Anesthesia in ApoE4 Knock-In Mouse Model.,"Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a concern following anesthesia, particularly in individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study compared the cognitive and pathological effects of propofol and remimazolam in a mouse model with AD following surgery. Five-month-old male ApoE4-KI mice underwent abdominal surgery under either propofol (170 mg/kg) or remimazolam (85 mg/kg) anesthesia. Cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze and Y-maze, and neuronal apoptosis and amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition in the CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus were evaluated preoperatively and at 2, 4, and 7 days postoperatively. Both groups showed similar postoperative cognitive functions, with increased relative escape latency at day 2 and decreased relative spontaneous alternation at days 4 and 7. However, the neuropathological analysis revealed that propofol-induced significantly more neuronal death in the CA3 (days 4 and 7) and DG (days 2, 4, and 7), and greater Aβ accumulation in the CA3 (days 2 and 4) and DG (days 2 and 7) compared to remimazolam (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Propofol was associated with more pronounced neuropathologic changes in the hippocampus compared to remimazolam. These findings suggest remimazolam may be a safer anesthetic for patients at risk for neurodegenerative disorders, as it is associated with less severe hippocampal pathology, which is characteristic of AD.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Jong-Ho Kim; Songyi Park; Harry Jung; Eun-Hae Lee; Eun-Seo Lee; Jae-Jun Lee; Jong-Hee Sohn
40565161,Metabolic and Inflammatory Biomarkers Predicting Sarcopenic Obesity and Cardiometabolic Risk in Arab Women: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"The sarcopenic obesity-related phenotype (SOP) is defined by the coexistence of sarcopenia and obesity, leading to heightened disability, morbidity, and mortality. Its multifactorial pathogenesis involves chronic inflammation and metabolic alterations. In this cross-sectional study, 562 women were classified into four groups: control, sarcopenic, obese, and SOP. Body composition measurements, including fat mass, skeletal muscle mass, and extracellular water (ECW), were assessed using the bioimpedance method. Several inflammatory biomarkers were measured in plasma samples by ELISA. Discriminant function analysis identified age, ECW, chemerin, the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), and the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TC/HDL-C) as significant discriminators among groups, clearly distinguishing SOP from control. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that these variables were independently associated with SOP status (SOP vs. control), regardless of age, with odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.87 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23-2.85) for SII to 7.77 (95% CI: 3.67-16.44) for ECW. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) analysis further demonstrated that SOP significantly increased the odds (OR: 3.04; 95% CI: 1.39-6.67) of multimorbidity (hypertension (HTN) + hyperlipidemia (HLD) + type 2 diabetes (D2T)). These findings suggest SOP is a clinically relevant phenotype linked to cardiometabolic comorbidities and systemic inflammation.

This study investigates the antitumor potential of bioactive compounds derived from <i>Cannabis sativa</i> and <i>Piper nigrum</i> using molecular docking, cell viability assays, and transcriptomic and expression analyses from public databases in humans and cell lines. Cannabichromene (CBC), cannabigerol (CBG), cannabidiol (CBD), and Piper nigrum derivates exhibited strong binding affinities relative to glioblastoma-associated targets GPR55 and PINK1. In vitro analyses demonstrated their cytotoxic effects on glioblastoma cell lines (U87MG, T98G, and CCF-STTG1), as well as on neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) and oligodendroglial (MO3.13) cell lines, revealing interactions among these compounds. The differential expression of GPR55 and PINK1 in tumor versus normal tissues further supports their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. These findings provide a basis for the development of novel therapies and suggest unexplored molecular pathways for the treatment of malignant glioma.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Andrés David Turizo Smith; Nicolás Montoya Moreno; Josefa Antonia Rodríguez-García; Juan Camilo Marín-Loaiza; Gonzalo Arboleda Bustos

Cerebral ischemia causes a rapid elevation of adenosine, the main neuromodulator in the brain. The inhibition of adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs) has been introduced as a potential target in neurodegenerative disorders involving extracellular adenosine elevation. Istradefylline, a selective A2AR antagonist, has been approved for Parkinson's disease (PD) adjunctive therapy and showed neuroprotective effects in PD and Alzheimer's disease. However, the role of A2ARs in post-stroke neuronal damage and behavioral deficits remains unclear. We recently showed that A2AR antagonism prevented the adenosine-induced post-hypoxia synaptic potentiation of glutamatergic neurotransmission following the hypoxia/reperfusion of hippocampal slices. Here, we investigated the potential neuroprotective effects of istradefylline in male <i>Sprague-Dawley</i> rats subjected to pial vessel disruption (PVD) used to model a small-vessel stroke. Rats were treated with either a vehicle control or istradefylline (3 mg/kg i.p.) following PVD surgery for three days. Istradefylline administration prevented anxiety and depressive-like behaviors caused by PVD stroke. In addition, istradefylline significantly attenuated ischemia-induced cognitive impairment and motor deficits. Moreover, istradefylline markedly reduced hippocampal neurodegeneration, as well as GFAP/Iba-1, TNF-α, nNOS, and iNOS levels after PVD, but prevented the downregulation of anti-inflammatory markers TGF-β1 and IL-4. Together, these results suggest a molecular link between stroke and PD and that the anti-PD drug istradefylline displays translational potential for drug repurposing as a neuroprotective agent for cerebral ischemic damage.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Michael G Zaki; Elisabet Jakova; Mahboubeh Pordeli; Elina Setork; Changiz Taghibiglou; Francisco S Cayabyab

Despite advances in understanding its genetic basis, particularly mutations in <i>Chromosome 9 Open Reading Frame 72</i> (<i>C9orf72</i>), <i>superoxide dismutase 1</i> (<i>SOD1</i>), <i>TAR DNA-binding protein</i> (<i>TARDBP</i>), and <i>Fused in Sarcoma</i> (<i>FUS</i>) gene, current diagnostic methods result in delayed intervention, and available treatments offer only modest benefits. This review examines innovative approaches transforming ALS research and clinical management. We explore emerging biomarkers, including the fluid-based markers such as neurofilament light chain, exosomes, and microRNAs in biological fluids, alongside the non-fluid-based biomarkers, including neuroimaging and electrophysiological markers, for early diagnosis and patient stratification. The integration of multi-omics data reveals complex molecular mechanisms underlying ALS heterogeneity, potentially identifying novel therapeutic targets. We highlight current gene therapy strategies, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), RNA interference (RNAi), and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing systems, alongside advanced delivery methods for crossing the blood-brain barrier. By bridging molecular neuroscience with bioengineering, these technologies promise to revolutionize ALS diagnosis and treatment, advancing toward truly disease-modifying interventions for this previously intractable condition.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Nina Bono; Flaminia Fruzzetti; Giorgia Farinazzo; Gabriele Candiani; Stefania Marcuzzo
40565132,Effects of Phenosanic Acid in Rat Seizure Models.,"Oxidative stress and membrane damage are believed to be principally involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. This study aimed to assess the effects of phenosanic acid (PA), an antioxidant and membrane protector, in acute pentylenetetrazole and chronic lithium-pilocarpine seizure models in male Wistar rats. PA was administered acutely (ip, 120 mg/kg BW ip, or 240 mg/kg BW per os) or chronically (80 mg/kg BW/day per os). Indices of free radical oxidation, the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, and the nitrergic system were assessed in blood and brain regions. Morphological analysis of the hippocampus was performed in the lithium-pilocarpine model. PA exerted an acute anti-seizure effect in the pentylenetetrazole model. In the lithium-pilocarpine model, acute PA treatment decreased the death rate and corticosterone levels in the neocortex and brainstem. In contrast, the level of free radical oxidation products reacting with thiobarbituric acid declined in the brain stem in response to chronic PA treatment. In the lithium-pilocarpine model, the neuronal density in the dentate gyrus was elevated, and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen positive (PCNA+) cell counts in the subgranular zone did not differ between groups. Doublecortin positive (DCX+) cell count was significantly increased after chronic PA treatment. PA-induced reduction in mortality in the lithium-pilocarpine epilepsy model may be partially mediated by decreasing the lipid peroxidation and corticosterone levels in different brain regions. Chronic PA treatment may affect adult hippocampal neurogenesis by either prolonging the action of factors that increase neurogenesis after status epilepticus or by slowing down the neuronal differentiation rate. These data suggest that PA may be a disease-modifying AED able to hamper epileptogenesis.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Victor A Aniol; Natalia A Lazareva; Yulia V Moiseeva; Olga A Nedogreeva; Margarita R Novikova; Pavel A Kostryukov; Mikhail V Onufriev; Natalia V Gulyaeva

In this study, we examined the relationship between neuroinflammation and three specific biomarkers-matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9, the inflammasome NLRP3, and the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA-in connection with PTSD symptoms assessed using the PTSD Symptom Scale-Interview for DSM-5 (PSSI-5). The symptoms were categorized into the following domains: re-experiencing, avoidance, alterations in cognition and mood, increased arousal and reactivity, distress and functional impairment, symptom onset and duration, and the total symptom score. Our findings confirmed the pro-inflammatory roles of MMP-2, MMP-9, and the inflammasome NLRP3, as well as the anti-inflammatory, calming effect of GABA. We identified strong correlations between biomarkers, particularly between MMP-2 and MMP-9, MMP-2 and NLRP3, and MMP-2 and GABA, highlighting a closely interconnected inflammatory response. Among the PSSI-5 domains, re-experiencing, increased arousal and reactivity, and distress and functional impairment showed the strongest associations with the total symptom score. Recent research focusing on these cellular mechanisms has provided valuable insights into the role of neuroinflammation in PTSD.

Benzodiazepines are widely prescribed but pose the risk of tolerance and cognitive decline; however, Z-drugs may offer safer alternatives. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to analyze the effect of benzodiazepines and Z-drugs on sleep disorders in patients with dementia. Two authors conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Espistemonikos, and ACCESSSS for studies published between 2019 and 2024 using the MeSH terms ""dementia"", ""sleep disorders"", and ""pharmacotherapy"". Randomized clinical trials comparing benzodiazepines, Z-drugs, or innovative medications with placebo or other drugs were included. Sleep and cognitive outcomes were assessed using validated instruments; the ROB-2 tool evaluated the risk of bias. The protocol was registered in ""PROSPERO"". Three randomized clinical trials involving a total of 192 patients were included in the review. Zopiclone increased the main duration of nighttime sleep by 81 min, Zolpidem reduced nighttime awakenings by 21 min, and Eszopiclone improved sleep quality, benefited the progression of sleep architecture, and reduced mental symptoms such as fear and anxiety. Z-drugs show superior efficacy and safety over benzodiazepines, improving sleep and cognitive symptoms in dementia.

40565114,CEST MRI in the Management/Diagnosis of Neuroinfectious Diseases.,"Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI is a novel technique that allows for the specific imaging of certain molecules that contain exchangeable protons. Neuroimaging is a major contributor to diagnosing and monitoring infections of the central nervous system (CNS). This review focuses on summarizing the current literature surrounding the use of CEST MRI imaging in diagnosing, monitoring, and treating CNS infections. BacCEST is a new technique to detect bacterial infection in organs at profound levels. This technique allows for the specific pathogen causing the infection to be understood, allowing for tailored antibiotic therapies. The bacCEST signal is also directly proportional to the number of bacterial cells; this means it can be used over periods to track response to treatment via cell numbers. The results show that most of the research in this area has focused on infections of the brain parenchyma (e.g., encephalitis) and that most studies investigate the use of CEST in animal models, with a minority exploring the application of CEST to human participants. The common neuroinfectious disease presentations relevant to clinical medicine are also briefly described, as well as the traditional and modern imaging techniques used to visualize them.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Zoe A Kortje; Horacio Bach
40565107,Targeted DNA Methylation Using Modified DNA Probes: A Potential Therapeutic Tool for Depression and Stress-Related Disorders.,"Epigenetic modifications play a crucial role in gene regulation and have been implicated in various physiological processes and disease conditions. DNA methylation (DNAm) has been implicated in the etiology and progression of many stress-related psychiatric behaviors, such as depression. The ability to manipulate DNAm may provide a means to reverse and treat such disorders. Although CRISPR-based technologies have enabled locus-specific DNAm editing, their clinical applicability may be limited due to immunogenicity concerns and off-target effects. In this study, we introduce a novel approach for targeted DNAm manipulation using single-stranded methylated DNA probes. The probes were designed against the GRE of FKBP5 and the promoter region of MAOA. In both human embryonic kidney HEK293 and mouse pituitary AtT-20 cells, transfection with their respective methylated probes significantly increased DNAm at targeted CpG sites in a persistent and dose-dependent manner. Importantly, the induced methylation effectively attenuated glucocorticoid-induced upregulation of FKBP5 gene expression. Alteration of methylation was specific to single-stranded probes, as double-stranded methylated probes and unmethylated probes showed no significant effects. Some limitations include the need to further characterize factors that influence probe efficiency, such as probe length and CpG density; develop an efficient in vivo probe delivery system; and perform a more extensive consideration of possible off-target effects. Despite these limitations, our findings suggest that methylated DNA probes have the potential to function as a simple tool for targeted epigenetic manipulation and serve as a safer alternative to CRISPR-based epigenome editing tools for the treatment of stress-related disorders such as depression.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Nishtaa Modi; Jeffrey Guo; Ryan A Lee; Alisha Greenstein; Richard S Lee
40565099,Epigenetic Alterations in Glioblastoma Multiforme as Novel Therapeutic Targets: A Scoping Review.,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive primary brain tumor with a dismal prognosis despite advances in multimodal treatment. Conventional therapies fail to achieve durable responses due to GBM's molecular heterogeneity and capacity to evade therapeutic pressures. Epigenetic alterations have emerged as critical contributors to GBM pathobiology, including aberrant DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA (ncRNA) dysregulation. These mechanisms drive oncogenesis, therapy resistance, and immune evasion. This scoping review evaluates the current state of knowledge on epigenetic modifications in GBM, synthesizing findings from original articles and preclinical and clinical trials published over the last decade. Particular attention is given to MGMT promoter hypermethylation status as a biomarker for temozolomide (TMZ) sensitivity, histone deacetylation and methylation as modulators of chromatin structure, and microRNAs as regulators of pathways such as apoptosis and angiogenesis. Therapeutically, epigenetic drugs, like DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), appear as promising approaches in preclinical models and early trials. Emerging RNA-based therapies targeting dysregulated ncRNAs represent a novel approach to reprogram the tumor epigenome. Combination therapies, pairing epigenetic agents with immune checkpoint inhibitors or chemotherapy, are explored for their potential to enhance treatment response. Despite these advancements, challenges such as tumor heterogeneity, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and off-target effects remain significant. Future directions emphasize integrative omics approaches to identify patient-specific targets and refine therapies. This article thus highlights the potential of epigenetics in reshaping GBM treatment paradigms.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Marco Meleiro; Rui Henrique
40565097,Apocynin Mitigates Diabetic Muscle Atrophy by Lowering Muscle Triglycerides and Oxidative Stress.,"Diabetic muscular atrophy is a complication of diabetes mellitus that can decrease quality of life. Its complex mechanisms include alterations in proteolytic pathways, oxidative stress, and intracellular lipid accumulation. NADPH oxidase enzymes (NOX) play a key role in the production of ROS, contributing to oxidative damage and insulin resistance. Apocynin, a NOX inhibitor, has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, suggesting its therapeutic potential in various diabetic complications. This study evaluated the impact of apocynin on the mechanisms of muscle atrophy in slow- and fast-twitch muscles of diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats by intraperitoneal injection of a single dose of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg). Apocynin treatment (3 mg/kg/day) was administered for 8 weeks. Fasting blood glucose levels, lipid profile, and weight gain were measured. Both slow-twitch (soleus) and fast-twitch (extensor digitorum longus, EDL) skeletal muscles were weighed and used to assess triglycerides (TG) content, histological analysis, lipid peroxidation levels, and gene expression evaluated by qRT-PCR. Apocynin reduced blood glucose levels, improved body weight, and exhibited hypolipidemic effects. It significantly increased muscle weight in EDL and soleus, especially in EDL muscle, lowering triglycerides, lipid peroxidation, and increasing fiber size. Additionally, it decreased mRNA expression levels of MuRF-1, atrogin-1, myostatin and p47phox mRNA and upregulated PGC-1α and follistatin mRNA. Apocynin exerted a myoprotective effect by mitigating muscle atrophy in diabetic rats. Its effects were differentially mediated on TG accumulation and muscle fiber size, reducing oxidative stress, atrogene expression, and positively regulating PGC-1α.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Sarai Sánchez-Duarte; Elizabeth Sánchez-Duarte; Luis A Sánchez-Briones; Esperanza Meléndez-Herrera; Ma Antonia Herrera-Vargas; Sergio Márquez-Gamiño; Karla S Vera-Delgado; Rocío Montoya-Pérez
40565091,Inhibition of Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase Prevents Docetaxel-Induced Painful Peripheral Neuropathy.,"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a painful condition recalcitrant to current available therapies. CIPN pain can be severe and dose-limiting or dose-reducing for life-extending chemotherapeutics and, to date, there is no treatment to alter the progression of CIPN. For these experiments we used docetaxel, a first-line therapy for metastatic prostate cancer in humans and investigated the soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor EC5026 for its analgesic efficacy against this CIPN pain. Male SD rats (n = 10/group) were pretreated with 1 mg/kg EC5026 in formulated drinking water or vehicle for one week prior to docetaxel injections. The rats continued the formulated drinking water during three once-a-week docetaxel 10 mg/kg i.p. injections and were maintained on treatment until the end of week 5 when all groups were transitioned to normal drinking water. Nociceptive testing occurred throughout the entire experiment including after transitioning to normal drinking water. EC5026 increased mechanical withdrawal thresholds and latencies on the cold plate compared to docetaxel-treated controls. There were no motor effects of the compound, and the formulated drinking water provided favorable exposure. These results demonstrated that EC5026 administered prophylactically was both analgesic and able to limit the severity of mechanical and cold sensitivities in the docetaxel CIPN rat model.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Karen M Wagner; Jun Yang; Christophe Morisseau; Bruce D Hammock
40565069,Montelukast Improves Urinary Bladder Function After Complete Spinal Cord Injury in Rats.,"Bladder dysfunction is among the most drastic and quality-of-life-reducing conditions after spinal cord injury (SCI). Neuroinflammation in the lower urinary tract (LUT) after SCI could be a key driver of neurogenic bladder dysfunction and tissue fibrosis. Leukotrienes, a group of highly active lipid mediators, are potent inflammatory mediators. Here, we explored the potential of early montelukast (MLK) therapy, a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 antagonist, on LUT function and structure four weeks after severe SCI in rats. Rats (strain Lewis, female, n = 50) received a permanent bladder catheter, followed by a complete T9 spinal cord transection. MLK was given daily, starting on day one post-injury. Bladder and locomotor function were regularly assessed. Bladder tissue was histologically and immunhistochemically analyzed. Post-SCI, MLK concentrations in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid were clinically relevant. MLK improved bladder functionality. MLK had no impact on smooth muscle alignment and uroepithelial integrity at this early SCI time point. This pilot study gave first insights into early, continuous oral MLK treatment with the first promising results of preserved LUT function and possible subsequent improved tissue integrity.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Elena E Keller; Sophina Bauer; Karin Roider; Michael Kleindorfer; Peter Törzsök; Julia Tevini; Thomas Felder; Ludwig Aigner; Lukas Lusuardi
40565068,Neuroprotective Potential of Betulin and Its Drug Formulation with Cyclodextrin-In Vitro Assessment.,"Central nervous system disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, are associated with complex pathophysiological mechanisms involving oxidative stress, inflammation, and protein misfolding. According to the literature, betulin, a natural compound derived from the bark of birch trees, demonstrates promising neuroprotective effects. This study investigates the neuroprotective potential of betulin and its complex with cyclodextrin, referred to as Betula Forte, using an in vitro model of differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Specifically, the study explores the antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties of these compounds under oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Our results indicated that Betula Forte exhibited lower cytotoxicity compared to betulin alone. Both substances enhanced cell viability in pre-incubation and co-incubation models, with Betula Forte showing superior efficacy under severe oxidative stress. Additionally, both substances exhibited protective effects against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis, as evidenced by reduced levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a lower number of apoptotic cells compared with the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells. These findings suggest that Betula Forte, due to lower cytotoxicity, may offer a more effective neuroprotective strategy than betulin alone, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Agnieszka Zakrzeska; Agnieszka Kołodziejczyk; Piotr Komorowski; Paulina Sokołowska; Bożena Rokita; Radosław A Wach; Małgorzata Siatkowska
40565060,DMPC-Based Liposomal Vesicles for Encapsulation and Controlled Release of NMN and Matrigel in Sarcopenia Therapy.,"Accurate diagnosis of diseases in patients is crucial, particularly in older individuals, where the focus is often placed primarily on advanced age and its associated symptoms. However, advancements in technology and research have revealed that certain diseases traditionally linked to aging can also manifest in younger populations, demonstrating similar bodily changes. One such condition is sarcopenia, a degenerative disease of skeletal muscle that arises from various pathological processes affecting the tissues. In this study, we developed a liposomal formulation based on 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC), in which both nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and Matrigel (Mgel) were co-encapsulated, each playing a distinct role in the management of sarcopenia. NMN is known to stimulate the increase of NAD+ levels, while Matrigel enhances the activity of satellite cells, thereby facilitating muscle fiber regeneration and stabilizing protein levels. Results from the DLS, SEM, and TEM analyses revealed significant differences attributed to the type of therapeutic agent used and the synthesis parameters. Additionally, the drug release profile underscored the complementary nature and significance of selecting the appropriate active substances for effective treatment strategies. The in vitro investigations aimed to assess the potential of DMPC lipid vesicles loaded with NMN, either alone or in combination with Matrigel, to counteract sarcopenia-associated oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. The results showed that both NMN-based formulations reduced oxidative damage, preserved mitochondrial function, and maintained cytoskeletal integrity in a hydrogen peroxide-induced model of sarcopenia. Importantly, the formulation containing both NMN and Matrigel demonstrated superior protective effects, suggesting a synergistic role of the extracellular matrix components in enhancing muscle cell resilience. These findings support the use of DMPC-based delivery systems as promising candidates for sarcopenia therapy and warrant further investigation into their mechanisms of action in preventing muscle cell degeneration.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Alfred Najm; Alexandra Cătălina Bîrcă; Adelina-Gabriela Niculescu; Adina Alberts; Alexandru Mihai Grumezescu; Bianca Gălățeanu; Bogdan Ștefan Vasile; Mircea Beuran; Bogdan Severus Gaspar; Claudiu Ștefan Turculeț; Ariana Hudiță
40565018,RIPK1 in Diffuse Glioma Pathology: From Prognosis Marker to Potential Therapeutic Target.,"Diffuse gliomas (DGs) are malignant primary brain tumors originating from glial cells. This study aimed to investigate the role of Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) in DG pathology. The RIPK1 mRNA expression was analyzed in DG databases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) containing clinical, genomic, and transcriptomic information from 670 patients. Transcriptomic studies were carried out using USC Xena and R, while in vitro assays were performed with the glioblastoma human cell line U251 and the commercial RIPK1 inhibitor GSK2982772. The results showed that high RIPK1 expression was linked to a lower survival probability in patients. Additionally, the RIPK1 expression was higher in the wtIDH samples compared to that in the mIDH samples. Significant differences in the expression of genes related to cellular dedifferentiation, proinflammatory cell death pathways, and tumor-infiltrating immune cells were found between high- and low-RIPK1 expression groups. To further characterize the role of RIPK1 in DG, the effects of the RIPK1 inhibitor were evaluated, alone or combined with cisplatin, on glioblastoma cell proliferation and apoptosis. The combined treatments effectively reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. The overexpression of RIPK1 was associated with a poor prognosis for DG, suggesting that RIPK1 plays a critical role in glioma pathogenesis and should be considered in therapeutic decision-making.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Leslie C Amorós Morales; Santiago M Gómez Bergna; Abril Marchesini; María Luján Scalise; Nazareno Gonzalez; M Leticia Ferrelli; Marianela Candolfi; Víctor Romanowski; Matias L Pidre
40565015,A Systematic Review of ABCB1 Polymorphisms and Antiseizure Medication Resistance: Insights from Effect Size and Study Power Analysis.,"The most investigated ABCB1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to antiseizure medication resistance are rs1045642 (c.3435C>T, p.Ile1145=), rs2032582 (c.2677G>T/A, p.Ala893Ser/Thr), and rs1128503 (c.1236C>T, p.Gly412=). We conducted a literature review to evaluate the genotype frequencies of rs1045642, rs2032582, and rs1128503 SNPs in different ancestries among the drug-resistant and drug-responsive epilepsy groups. Furthermore, we performed effect size and study power analyses and determined the expected sample size to reach a study power of 0.8 for each conducted research. High and very high statistical power for the rs1045642, rs2032582, and rs1128503 polymorphisms was achieved in 58.0, 60.7, and 31.8% of the studies, respectively. The effect sizes (ES) of rs1045642, rs2032582, and rs1128503 ranged from 0.03-1.04, 0.06-0.92, and 0.04-0.64, respectively. The required sample sizes for rs1045642, rs2032582, and rs1128503 ranged from 9-13,000, 12-2600, and 24-5700 participants, respectively. None of the polymorphisms showed a statistically significant association with antiseizure medication resistance in the forest plots. Our analysis provides valuable guidance for future genetic association studies in the field of drug-resistant epilepsy.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Aurelija Daškevičiūtė; Edgaras Zaboras; Jonas Navalinskas; Karolis Baronas; Arminas Jasionis; Eglė Navickienė; Rūta Mameniškienė
40565009,Reduced Gene Dosage of the Psychiatric Risk Gene <i>Cacna1c</i> Is Associated with Impairments in Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Activity in Rats.,"Common and rare variation in <i>CACNA1C</i> gene expression has been consistently associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression. However, the underlying biological pathways that cause this association have yet to be fully determined. In this study, we present evidence that rats with a reduced gene dosage of <i>Cacna1c</i> have increased basal corticosterone levels in the periphery and reduced the expression of <i>Nr3c1</i> encoding the glucocorticoid receptor in the hippocampus and hypothalamus. These results are consistent, with an effect of <i>Cacna1c</i> dosage on hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function. Heterozygous <i>Cacna1c</i> rats had lower levels of the histone markers H3K4me3 and H3K27acat exon 1<sub>7</sub> of the <i>Nr3c1</i> gene. These histone modifications are typically linked to increased gene expression, but here were not associated with changes in the expression of exon 1<sub>7</sub> variants under non-stress conditions. Heterozygous <i>Cacna1c</i> rats additionally show increased anxiety behaviours. These results support an association of <i>Cacna1c</i> heterozygosity with the altered activity of the HPA axis and function in the resting state, and this may be a predisposing mechanism that contributes to the increased risk of psychiatric disorders with stress.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Anna L Moon; Eleanor R Mawson; Patricia Gasalla; Lawrence S Wilkinson; Dominic M Dwyer; Jeremy Hall; Kerrie L Thomas
40565005,Beyond Transgenic Mice: Emerging Models and Translational Strategies in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia and a growing public health concern worldwide. Despite decades of research, effective disease-modifying treatments remain elusive, partly due to limitations in current experimental models. The purpose of this review is to critically assess and compare existing murine and alternative models of AD to identify key strengths, limitations, and future directions for model development that can enhance translational relevance and therapeutic discovery. Traditional transgenic mouse models have advanced the understanding of amyloid-beta and tau pathologies, but often fail to capture the complexity of sporadic, late-onset AD. In response, alternative models-including zebrafish, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, non-human primates, and human brain organoids-are gaining traction due to their complementary insights and diverse experimental advantages. This review also discusses innovations in genetic engineering, neuroimaging, computational modelling, and drug repurposing that are reshaping the landscape of AD research. By integrating these diverse approaches, the review advocates for a multi-model, multidisciplinary strategy to improve the predictive power, accelerate clinical translation, and inform personalised therapeutic interventions. Ethical considerations and equitable access to diagnostics and emerging treatments are also emphasised. Ultimately, this work aims to support the development of more accurate, effective, and human-relevant models to combat AD.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Paula Alexandra Lopes; José L Guil-Guerrero
40564999,Plasma Proteome Profiling Reveals Inflammation Markers and Tafamidis Effects in V30M Transthyretin Polyneuropathy.,"Transthyretin (TTR) variant (V30M) polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN) is a progressive systemic amyloidosis caused by transthyretin aggregation, leading to a variety of debilitating manifestations, including neuropathy and cardiomyopathy. We investigated the plasma proteome of heterozygotic V30M TTR asymptomatic carriers and heterozygotic V30M ATTRv-PN patients (before and after tafamidis treatment) versus WT TTR healthy control plasma using an organic solvent-induced shift in solubility assay to identify biosignatures for disease progression and therapeutic response. We identified many proteins, including TTR, apolipoproteins, ceruloplasmin, and proteins with functions in innate immunity that displayed changes in either their abundances or their sensitivity to precipitation. Elevated oxidative modifications of TTR and APOE in ATTRv-PN patients suggest a role for oxidative stress in disease pathogenesis/progression. Tafamidis treatment mitigated these pathology-associated changes, suggesting that alleviating proteotoxic stress impacts these other pathways. Although our study was limited to a Portuguese cohort, these findings nevertheless provide a comprehensive plasma proteomic profile of V30M ATTRv-PN patients, V30M TTR carriers, and tafamidis-treated ATTRv-PN patients over up to 60 months; provide insights into ATTRv-PN pathophysiology; identify potential biomarkers for disease progression and therapeutic response; and highlight the utility of proteomics in advancing personalized treatments for amyloidosis.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Karina Nugroho; Chung-Yon Lin; Cecilia Monteiro; Teresa Coelho; James J Moresco; Antonio F M Pinto; Evan T Powers; John R Yates; Jolene K Diedrich; Jeffery W Kelly
40564997,"MiR 329/449 Suppresses Cell Proliferation, Migration and Synergistically Sensitizes GBM to TMZ by Inhibiting Src/FAK, NF-kB, and Cyclin D1 Activity.","Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is one of the most common brain tumors and is associated with aggressive tumor characteristics and extremely poor patient survival. The median survival time for GBM patients is around 12-15 months. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a key chemotherapeutic drug used in the treatment of GBM. However, at least 50% of GBM patients do not respond to TMZ, necessitating the identification of novel therapeutic strategies sensitizing patients to TMZ. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of two different tumor suppressor microRNAs (miR-329 and miR-449b) on cell proliferation and migration of GBM cells, and their potential for sensitizing GBM cells to TMZ. Our findings show that MiR-329/449b treatments suppressed spheroid formation and migration of GBM (LN229 and U87) cells. When miR treatments were combined with Temozolomide (TMZ), we also observed that they synergistically enhanced the suppressive effects of TMZ and inhibited the activity of clinically significant NF-KB and Src/FAK signaling pathways, making the combination therapy a viable option to treat GBM, with greater impact on patient survival.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Megan Mendieta; Mehrdad Bandegi; Ezgi Biltekin; Yasemin M Akay; Bulent Ozpolat; Metin Akay
40564996,The Retinal Dopaminergic Circuit as a Biomarker for Huntington's and Alzheimer's Diseases.,"Retinal dysfunction is emerging as a potential early marker of neurodegenerative diseases. Within the retina, the dopaminergic circuit, comprising dopaminergic amacrine cells, dopamine synthesis and turnover, and dopamine receptor signalling, is essential for visual processing, particularly colour contrast perception. Disruption of this circuit may underline early retinal alterations observed in Huntington's disease (HD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we systematically analysed retinal dopaminergic dysfunction in murine models of HD (genetic origin) and AD (sporadic), across different disease stages. We assessed dopamine levels, turnover, tyrosine hydroxylase expression, D1 and D2 receptor gene expression, and neurotransmitter balance. HD mice showed early and marked alterations: reduced dopamine content, decreased tyrosine hydroxylase, increased turnover, and downregulation of D1 receptor expression-all preceding motor symptoms and detectable brain pathology. In contrast, AD mice showed only mild changes at later stages; however, clinical evidence suggests that similar dysfunction may occur earlier in human AD. These findings position retinal dopaminergic disruption as a potential early biomarker in HD and possibly in AD. While the current study relies on invasive techniques in animal models, it lays the groundwork for non-invasive retinal assessments, such as electroretinography or optical coherence tomography, as promising tools for early diagnosis and disease monitoring in neurodegeneration.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Pedro Blanco-Hernán; Lorena Aguado; María José Asensio; Ana Gómez-Soria; Pedro de la Villa; María José Casarejos; Alicia Mansilla
40564995,Breaking the Triad: Immune Tolerance Induction Without Antigen Co-Presentation via Tim Agonist for the Treatment of Autoimmune Diseases.,"Autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) are characterized by a loss of self-tolerance, driven by diminished regulatory T cell (Treg) function and elevated Th1/Th17 responses. Existing therapies broadly suppress the immune system without correcting this imbalance, often leading to adverse effects. LPX3, a novel small-molecule T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing 3 and 4 (Tim-3/4) receptor agonist, was developed to restore immune tolerance via Treg induction. In this study, LPX3 was formulated into a liposomal oral delivery system, enabling efficient uptake through the gastrointestinal tract and lymphatic targeting. In vitro and in vivo analyses confirmed LPX3's ability to expand CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs in a dose-dependent manner. In a MOG-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS, both prophylactic and therapeutic oral administration of LPX3 significantly delayed disease onset, reduced symptom severity, and improved survival. Importantly, efficacy was achieved without antigen co-delivery, indicating an antigen-independent mechanism of immune modulation. LPX3 liposomes showed deep lymph node penetration and colocalization with immune cells, supporting its functional delivery to key immunological sites. These findings suggest LPX3 is a promising candidate for treating autoimmune diseases by re-establishing immune regulation through oral, antigen-agnostic tolerance induction.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Basel Karzoun; Abdulraouf Ramadan; Saleh Allababidi; Anas M Fathallah
40564991,Understanding the Role of Endocannabinoids in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.,"Posttraumatic stress disorder is often treatment-resistant and recent research has suggested that treatment outcomes might be improved by modulation of the endocannabinoid system. The current review article describes animal and human research examining the effect of endocannabinoid modulation on posttraumatic symptoms, behaviours, and relevant memory processes. While the preclinical literature is reasonably consistent, emerging human literature is mixed. This review explores some potential reasons for why human research in this field is inconsistent and proposes multiple avenues for future research to answer these questions. Clinical trials testing the logistical challenges of cannabinoid administration and carefully designed human experimental studies are urgently required before cannabinoid therapy can be considered as an approach for treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Luke Ney
40564988,Serum Insulin-like Growth Factor-II Is Associated with Poor Poststroke Outcomes in Males: A Secondary Analysis.,"The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system has significance for poststroke outcomes. Previously, we reported that low serum IGF-II (s-IGF-II) in the acute phase is associated with poststroke mortality, and that IGF-II is lower among males. Given the known interactions of the IGF system and estrogen receptor signaling, s-IGF-II may have sex-specific effects. In this study, we conducted a secondary analysis of sex differences in s-IGF-II and poststroke functional outcomes and mortality after ischemic stroke (IS) in the Sahlgrenska Academy Study on Ischemic Stroke (SAHLSIS, males; <i>n</i> = 315, females; <i>n</i> = 177). Functional outcomes were assessed using the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 3 months and 2 years poststroke. Survival was recorded for 7 years or until death. Males in the lowest quintile of acute s-IGF-II had a higher poststroke mortality, with a crude hazard ratio [HR] of 2.52 (95% confidence interval [CI]) 1.59-3.99) and an adjusted HR of 1.83 (95% CI 1.09-3.06). No corresponding significant association was observed in females. Although acute s-IGF-II was crudely associated with poor functional outcomes among males after 3 months and 2 years, these associations were not independent of initial stroke severity in adjusted models. In conclusion, low levels of acute s-IGF-II are linked with poststroke mortality among males, but not significantly in females. Further studies are, however, warranted with sex hormone analysis, consideration of specific cause of death, and more females.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Christian Glamheden; N David Åberg; Gustaf Gadd; Daniel Åberg
40564986,"Subcortical Circuits Among Pedunculopontine Nucleus, Thalamus and Basal Ganglia Play Important Roles in Paroxysmal Arousal in Genetic Rat Models of Autosomal Dominant Sleep-Related Hypermotor Epilepsy.","A part of autosomal dominant sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (ADSHE) is caused by mutant CHRNA4. The pathomechanisms underlying motor seizures followingly brief/sudden awakening (paroxysmal arousal) in ADSHE seizures remain to be clarified. This study determined extracellular levels of ACh and L-glutamate in the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) and its projection regions, including the thalamus and basal ganglia, during wakefulness, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and paroxysmal arousal of transgenic rats bearing rat S286L-mutant Chrna4 (S286L-TG), corresponding to human S284L-mutant CHRNA4, using microdialysis. The expression of connexin43 and pannexin1 in the plasma membrane of the PPN was determined using capillary immunoblotting. The expressions of connexin43 and pannexin1 in the PPN plasma membrane of S286L-TG were larger than the wild type. The extracellular L-glutamate levels in the PPN and projection regions of S286L-TG consistently increased during both wakefulness and SWS compared to the wild type. The extracellular levels of ACh and L-glutamate in the PPN and projection regions decreased accompaning SWS in the wild type. In S286L-TG, this decreasing extracellular ACh level was observed, whereas decreasing L-glutamate level was impaired. Both extracellular levels of ACh and L-glutamate in the PPN and projection regions drastically increased during paroxysmal arousal. Hemichannel inhibitors suppressed the increasing releases of ACh and L-glutamate induced by paroxysmal arousal but decreased and did not affect extracellular levels of L-glutamate and ACh during wakefulness and SWS, respectively. In particular, under hemichannels inhibition, decreasing L-glutamate release accompanying SWS was observed in S286L-TG. This study elucidated that enhanced hemichannels are predominantly involved in the dysfunction of glutamatergic transmission compared to AChergic transmission during the interictal stage in S286L-TG, whereas the hyperactivation of hemichannels contributes to the generation of paroxysmal arousal. Therefore, the hyperactivated excitatory tripartite synaptic transmission associated with hemichannels in the PPN and projection regions plays important roles in epileptogenesis/ictogenesis in S286L-TG.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Ruri Okubo; Eishi Motomura; Motohiro Okada
40564978,Effect of Mutations in the C-Terminal 22-24 Domains of Filamin C Associated with Cardio- and Myopathies on Its Interaction with Small Heat Shock Protein HspB7.,"We investigated the interaction of HspB7 and its α-crystallin domain with the wild-type (WT) C-terminal fragment of human filamin C (FLNC), containing immunoglobulin-like domains 22-24 and its three mutants associated with cardio- and myopathies. The physicochemical properties of the WT FLNC fragment and its three mutants, p.Glu2472_Asn2473delinsAsp (EN/D) located in the 22nd domain, p.P2643_L2645del (ΔPGL), and p.W2710X (Wmut) both located in the 24th immunoglobulin-like domain were analyzed. Although all FLNC fragments had similar secondary structures, WT FLNC and its EN/D and ΔPGL mutants formed dimers, whereas Wmut formed either monomers or aggregates. The surface hydrophobicity of EN/D, ΔPGL, and especially Wmut mutants was larger than that of the WT fragment. Size exclusion chromatography, native gel electrophoresis, and chemical crosslinking indicated that the efficiency of interaction with HspB7 or its α-crystallin domain decreased in the order WT~EN/D > ΔPGL. Wmut was unable to interact with either HspB7 or its α-crystallin domain. Modeling via Alphafold 3 indicated that EN/D mutation affected the orientation of two loops connecting β-strands in the 22nd domain, while the ΔPGL and Wmut mutations exposed a hydrophobic groove in the 24th domain thereby reducing their interaction with HspB7. These findings reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying filaminopathies associated with three mutations in the C-terminal region of filamin C.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Lydia K Muranova; Varvara M Vostrikova; Nikolai B Gusev
40564976,Comprehensive Anatomical Staging Predicts Clinical Progression in Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Data-Driven Approach.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents significant challenges in clinical practice due to its heterogeneous manifestation and variable progression rates. This work develops a comprehensive anatomical staging framework to predict progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Using the ADNI database, the scalable Subtype and Stage Inference (s-SuStaIn) model was applied to 118 neuroanatomical features from cognitively normal (<i>n</i> = 504) and AD (<i>n</i> = 346) participants. The framework was validated on 808 MCI participants through associations with clinical progression, CSF and FDG-PET biomarkers, and neuropsychiatric measures, while adjusting for common confounders (age, gender, education, and APOE ε4 alleles). The framework demonstrated superior prognostic accuracy compared to traditional risk assessment (C-index = 0.73 vs. 0.62). Four distinct disease subtypes showed differential progression rates, biomarker profiles (FDG-PET and CSF Aβ42), and cognitive trajectories: Subtype 1, subcortical-first pattern; Subtype 2, executive-cortical pattern; Subtype 3, disconnection pattern; and Subtype 4, frontal-executive pattern. Stage-dependent changes revealed systematic deterioration across diverse cognitive domains, particularly in learning acquisition, visuospatial processing, and functional abilities. This data-driven approach captures clinically meaningful disease heterogeneity and improves prognostication in MCI, potentially enabling more personalized therapeutic strategies and clinical trial design.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Raghav Tandon; Yajun Mei; James J Lah; Cassie S Mitchell
40564972,Unveiling GABA and Serotonin Interactions During Neurodevelopment to Re-Open Adult Critical Periods for Neuropsychiatric Disorders.,"The mature brain is the result of a complex neurodevelopmental process resulting from interweaved mechanisms and involving early genetic and microenvironmental factors shaped by patterns of spontaneous electrical activity. During postnatal development, the immature brain undergoes experience-dependent structural and functional shaping and modifications during critical period (CP) time windows to achieve the full maturation of brain functions. Plasticity is higher during neurodevelopmental CP windows and is limited in the adult brain, including during neuropsychiatric disorders. Notably, the neurotransmitters γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and serotonin are two fundamental players controlling and modulating, respectively, brain plasticity in the developing and adult brain. Therefore, acquiring insights into the roles played by GABA and serotonin in regulating CP plasticity might hold potential for pharmacologically re-opening CP windows in adult life, with the aim of providing therapeutic intervention for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Emanuela Beretta; Gianmarco Cuboni; Gabriele Deidda
40564971,Omega-3 Fatty Acids Mitigate Long-Lasting Disruption of the Endocannabinoid System in the Adult Mouse Hippocampus Following Adolescent Binge Drinking.,"Adolescent binge drinking has lasting behavioral consequences by disrupting the endocannabinoid system (ECS) and depleting brain omega-3. The natural accumulation of omega-3 fatty acids in cell membranes is crucial for maintaining the membrane structure, supporting interactions with the ECS, and restoring synaptic plasticity and cognition impaired by prenatal ethanol (EtOH) exposure. However, it remains unclear whether omega-3 supplementation can mitigate the long-term effects on the ECS, endocannabinoid-dependent synaptic plasticity, and cognition following adolescent binge drinking. Here, we demonstrated that omega-3 supplementation during EtOH withdrawal increases CB1 receptors in hippocampal presynaptic terminals of male mice, along with the recovery of receptor-stimulated [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding to Gαi/o proteins. These changes are associated with long-term potentiation (LTP) at excitatory medial perforant path (MPP) synapses in the dentate gyrus (DG), which depends on anandamide (AEA), transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Finally, omega-3 intake following binge drinking reduced the time and number of errors required to locate the escape box in the Barnes maze test. Collectively, these findings suggest that omega-3 supplementation restores Barnes maze performance to levels comparable to those of control mice after adolescent binge drinking. This recovery is likely mediated by modulation of the hippocampal ECS, enhancing endocannabinoid-dependent excitatory synaptic plasticity.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Maitane Serrano; Miquel Saumell-Esnaola; Garazi Ocerin; Gontzal García Del Caño; Edgar Soria-Gómez; Amaia Mimenza; Nagore Puente; Itziar Bonilla-Del Río; Almudena Ramos-Uriarte; Leire Reguero; Brian R Christie; Fernando Rodríguez de Fonseca; Marta Rodríguez-Arias; Inmaculada Gerrikagoitia; Pedro Grandes
40564965,"Understanding the Immune System's Intricate Balance: Activation, Tolerance, and Self-Protection.","Understanding the mechanisms of immune activation and deactivation is paramount. A host must initiate effective immunity against pathogenic infections while avoiding triggering immunity against self-antigens, which can lead to detrimental autoimmune disorders. Host immunological pathways can be categorized as Immunoglobulin (Ig)G-dominant eradicable immune reactions and IgA-dominant tolerable immune reactions. Eradicable immune reactions include Th1, Th2, Th22, and Thαβ immune responses against four different types of pathogens. Tolerable immune reactions include Th1-like, Th9, Th17, and Th3 immune responses against four different types of pathogens. Here, we try to determine the mechanisms of activation and deactivation of host immune reactions. The spleen and liver play contrasting roles in mediating immune responses: the spleen is primarily involved in immune activation, whereas the liver is responsible for immune deactivation. Similarly, the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems have opposing functions in immune modulation, with the sympathetic system promoting pro-inflammatory responses and the parasympathetic system facilitating anti-inflammatory processes. Furthermore, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and glucocorticosteroids exhibit contrasting effects on immune regulation: ACTH is involved in activating adaptive immunity while inhibiting innate immunity, whereas glucocorticosteroids activate natural IgM antibody associated with innate immunity while inhibiting adaptive immunity. Heat shock proteins, particularly molecular chaperones induced by fever, play pivotal roles in immune activation. Conversely, IgD B cells and gamma/delta T cells contribute to immune deactivation through mechanisms such as clonal anergy. Understanding these mechanisms provides insights into immunological pathways, aiding in the better management of infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Jui-Yun Chen; Li-Jane Shih; Min-Tser Liao; Kuo-Wang Tsai; Kuo-Cheng Lu; Wan-Chung Hu
40564963,Co-Aggregation of Syndecan-3 with β-Amyloid Aggravates Neuroinflammation and Cognitive Impairment in 5×FAD Mice.,"Abnormal deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) is a core pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Syndecan-3 (SDC3), a type I transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), is abnormally overexpressed in the brains of AD patients and model animals, specifically accumulating in the peri-plaque region of amyloid plaques. However, its regulatory mechanism in the process of Aβ deposition remains unclear. This study aims to clearly define the role of SDC3 in Aβ aggregation and neuroinflammation, two critical processes in AD pathogenesis. Specifically, we investigate how SDC3 modulates Aβ aggregation and its interaction with neuroinflammatory pathways, which may contribute to the progression of AD. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying SDC3's involvement in these processes, we seek to provide new insights into potential therapeutic targets for AD. In this study, a 5×FAD mouse model with downregulated SDC3 expression was constructed. Behavioral assessments and synaptic function tests were performed to explore the effects of SDC3 on cognition in 5×FAD mice. Immunofluorescence co-localization technology was utilized to analyze the pathological co-deposition of SDC3 and Aβ in the hippocampus, cortex, and meningeal blood vessels. Quantitative assessments of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as <i>Tnf-α</i> and <i>Cxcl10</i> in the brain were performed through histopathological analysis combined with qPCR. Western blotting was used to examine the phosphorylation status of STAT1/STAT3 and the expression changes of IBA1/GFAP to systematically analyze the molecular mechanisms through which SDC3 regulates AD pathology. This study revealed that SDC3 expression was significantly upregulated in the brain regions of the 5×FAD model mice and co-localized pathologically with Aβ. Cell lineage tracing analysis showed that the elevated SDC3 expression primarily originated from glial cells. Behavioral and pathological results demonstrated that downregulation of SDC3 significantly improved cognitive dysfunction in the model mice and effectively reduced the Aβ burden in the brain. Molecular mechanism studies showed that downregulation of SDC3 reduced the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3, thereby inhibiting the activation of the JAK-STAT and cGAS-STING signaling pathways, reducing the activation of microglia/astrocytes and suppressing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as <i>Tnf-α</i> and <i>Cxcl10</i>. This study reveals that SDC3 co-localizes with Aβ pathology and synergistically exacerbates neuroinflammation. Knockdown of SDC3 can simultaneously reduce both Aβ deposition and the release of inflammatory factors from glial cells. Mechanistic research indicates that SDC3 drives a ""glial activation-cytokine release"" vicious cycle through the JAK-STAT and cGAS-STING signaling pathways. These findings suggest that SDC3 may serve as a key hub coordinating amyloid pathology and neuroinflammation in AD, providing new insights for the development of combination therapies targeting the HSPG network.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Fan Ye; Mingfeng Li; Min Liu; Xinghan Wu; Fan Tian; Yanju Gong; Yan Cao; Jingtai Zhang; Xueling Zhang; Chuan Qin; Ling Zhang
40564955,Clinical and Genetic Characteristics of Parkinson's Disease Patients with Substantia Nigra Hyperechogenicity.,"Hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra (SN) is observed using transcranial ultrasonography in patients with Parkinson's Disease. In this study, we investigated whether monogenic forms of PD are more prevalent in these patients and clinically defined their characteristics. Eighty-eight PD patients were part of the analysis. All patients received clinical diagnoses from experienced movement disorder specialists. Each patient underwent transcranial ultrasonography and genetic testing for mutations in the <i>SNCA</i>, <i>PRKN</i>, <i>LRRK2</i>, <i>DJ1</i>, and <i>PINK1</i> genes. SN hyperechogenicity was identified in 48 patients. Compared to the non-hyperechogenicity group, these patients did not have monogenic forms of PD more frequently, but they did have REM sleep behavior disorder significantly more often, lived in rural areas, and experienced a later age of disease onset. Our study indicated no association between substantia nigra echogenicity and the presence of mutations in the <i>SNCA</i>, <i>LRRK2</i>, <i>DJ1</i>, <i>PRKN</i>, and <i>PINK1</i> genes. Hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra, however, remains a common finding in patients with Parkinson's Disease, correlating with certain features of the disease.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Łukasz Milanowski; Piotr Szukało; Małgorzata Kowalska; Alicja Sikorska; Dorota Hoffman-Zacharska; Dariusz Koziorowski
40564942,Molecular Screening Reveals De Novo Loss-of-Function <i>NR4A2</i> Variants in Saudi Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Single-Center Study.,"Dysregulated expression of nuclear receptor superfamily 4 group A member 2 (<i>NR4A2</i>) has recently been associated with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), speech impairment, and neurodevelopmental delay (NDD); however, its precise role in the prevalence and etiopathogenesis of ASD has not been fully elucidated. Herein, we aimed to explore the role of <i>NR4A2</i> variants in the genetic underpinnings of ASD among Saudi children of different age ranges and phenotype severities. A total of 338 children with ASD from 315 unrelated families (293 simplex, 2 quads, and 1 quintet) were screened for <i>NR4A2</i> variants via exome sequencing (ES) of the genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), after which the probands with identified <i>NR4A2</i> variants were further subjected to trio genetic analyses. ES analysis revealed 10 de novo <i>NR4A2</i> variants (5 indels/nonsense, 2 missense, and 3 variants affecting splicing) in 8 unrelated probands (2.37%) and 2 affected siblings from 8 unrelated families (6 simplex (2.04%) and 2 quads (8.7%)). Three <i>NR4A2</i> variants were notably recurrent among both affected and unaffected carriers. All identified indels and two splicing variants met the criteria for pathogenic/loss-of-function (LoF) variants according to the ACMG classification (PVS1), whereas the missense variants were classified as of uncertain significance (VUS). This study is among the first to identify such a high frequency of recurrent variants in an ASD cohort, suggesting their significant contribution to the etiopathogenesis of ASD within this population.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Najwa M Alharbi; Wejdan F Baaboud; Heba Shawky; Aisha A Alrofaidi; Reem M Farsi; Khloud M Algothmi; Shahira A Hassoubah; Fatemah S Basingab; Sheren A Azhari; Mona G Alharbi; Reham Yahya; Safiah Alhazmi
40564934,Homocysteinylation of Fibrinogen: A Post-Translational Link to Thrombosis.,"Homocysteinylation, a post-translational modification involving the covalent attachment of homocysteine to proteins, has emerged as a critical mechanism linking hyperhomocysteinemia to thrombotic disease. This review focuses on the homocysteinylation of fibrinogen, a key coagulation factor, and its impact on clot structure and function. Evidence indicates that elevated homocysteine levels can induce significant changes in fibrin architecture, promoting the formation of dense, rigid clots with reduced permeability and impaired fibrinolytic susceptibility, thus fostering a prothrombotic environment. However, inconsistencies in reported effects on fiber diameter and polymerization kinetics highlight the need for standardized experimental protocols. Advances in proteomics and high-resolution imaging are expected to clarify the molecular underpinnings of these modifications. Moreover, homocysteinylation intersects with oxidative stress and may serve as a mechanistic bridge between metabolic and vascular dysfunction. Understanding its role not only enhances insight into thrombosis but also opens avenues for biomarker discovery and targeted therapies in cardiovascular and potentially neurological disorders.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Elvira Giurranna; Francesca Nencini; Serena Borghi; Ilenia Barbaro; Niccolò Taddei; Claudia Fiorillo; Matteo Becatti
40564928,Breaking the Cycle: Can Vitamin D Bridge the Gap Between Gut Microbiota and Immune Dynamics in Multiple Sclerosis?,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease with autoimmune and neurodegenerative features that affect the nervous system. Genetic predisposition and environmental factors, such as vitamin D deficiency and dysbiosis activating a pro-inflammatory response, have a role in the etiology of the disease. In this context, the interactions of vitamin D with the gut microbiota and immune system have attracted attention in recent years. Vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol) modulates the immune response by binding to the Vitamin D receptor (VDR). This pathway supports the functions of regulatory T cells by suppressing the activity of T helper cells 1 and 17 (Th1 and Th17). In MS patients, dysbiosis is characterized by a decrease in microbial diversity, and an increase in pro-inflammatory species is observed when compared to healthy individuals. Vitamin D has protective effects on eubiosis via VDR in intestinal epithelial cells, also reducing intestinal permeability by regulating tight junction proteins. In this way, vitamin D may contribute to the prevention of systemic inflammation. Although the relationship between vitamin D and the immune system is well documented, studies that address the triad of vitamin D level, gut microbiota, and immune response in MS are still limited.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Feray Gençer Bingöl; Emine Kocyigit; Elif Çelik; Duygu Ağagündüz; Ferenc Budán
40564921,"Geraniin Ameliorates Haloperidol-Induced Orofacial Dyskinesia in Rats Through Mitigating Neuronal Oxidative Stress, Neuroinflammation, and Apoptosis via Modulation of the Nrf2 Signaling Pathway.","Geraniin (GRN), an ellagitannin from Phyllanthus urinaria, shows antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. This study evaluated GRN's potential against haloperidol (HPD)-induced orofacial dyskinesia (OD). Rats treated with HPD (1 mg/kg i.p.) for 21 days exhibited dopamine D2 receptor blockade, neurotoxicity, and OD, characterized by vacuous chewing movements (VCM) and tongue protrusion (TP). Then, 60 min post-HPD, GRN was administered i.p. daily for 21 days. OD behaviors were assessed, and on Day 21, striatal tissues were analyzed for oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, inflammation, and apoptosis. GRN alone did not cause OD but significantly reduced HPD-induced VCM and TP. It also reduced oxidative stress, improved antioxidant defense, preserved mitochondrial function, and decreased neuroinflammation and apoptosis. These effects were blocked by ML385, a nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway inhibitor. GRN protects against HPD-induced OD, likely via Nrf2 activation. It may be a promising candidate for TD therapy, pending further clinical investigation.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Chih-Pei Hsu; Hsiang-Chien Tseng; Chih-Hsiang Fang; Yi-Wen Lin; Hung-Sheng Soung
40564903,Prolonged Intestinal Ethanol Absorption and Oxidative Stress: Revisiting the Gut-Liver Axis in Alcohol-Associated Disease.,"Chronic alcohol consumption induces oxidative stress not only in the liver but also in the gastrointestinal tract, where prolonged intestinal ethanol absorption plays a pivotal and underrecognized role. This review reframes ethanol pharmacokinetics to emphasize sustained jejunal and ileal uptake, which maintains elevated blood alcohol levels and perpetuates redox imbalance across the gut-liver axis. We integrate recent findings on ethanol-induced barrier dysfunction, CYP2E1-mediated ROS production, microbial dysbiosis, and mitochondrial disruption, proposing that the intestine is an active site of injury and a driver of systemic inflammation. Key mechanistic insights reveal that gut-derived endotoxins, compromised epithelial integrity, and microbiome-mitochondria interactions converge to exacerbate hepatic and extrahepatic damage. We further explore emerging therapeutic strategies-ranging from NAD<sup>+</sup> repletion and probiotics to fecal microbiota transplantation-that target this upstream pathology. Recognizing prolonged intestinal ethanol absorption as a clinically meaningful phase offers new directions for early intervention and redox-based treatment in alcohol-associated disease.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025,Beom Sun Chung; Keungmo Yang; Chihyun Park; Tom Ryu
40564895,Assessment of White Matter Changes Using Quantitative T1ρ Mapping in an Open-Field Low-Intensity Blast Mouse Model of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI).,"Blast-induced mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) occurs when shock waves travel through blood vessels and cerebrospinal fluid, leading to cerebral demyelination, which results in cognitive impairments and neuropsychiatric issues that impact quality of life. This study aims to evaluate myelin changes in white matter in mice with mTBI induced by an open-field low-intensity blast (LIB) using a newly implemented 3D adiabatic T1ρ prepared fast spin echo (Adiab-T1ρ-FSE) sequence for quantitative T1ρ MRI mapping. Thirty male C57BL/6 mice, including 15 mTBI and 15 sham controls, were scanned on a 3T Bruker MRI scanner. Luxol fast blue (LFB) staining was performed to assess myelin content differences between the mTBI and sham control groups. A significantly higher T1ρ value in the medial corpus callosum (MCC) was found in mTBI mice compared to controls (126.8 ± 2.5 ms vs. 129.8 ± 2.5 ms; <i>p</i> < 0.001), consistent with the reduced myelin observed in LFB staining (0.80 ± 0.14 vs. 1.02 ± 0.06; <i>p</i> = 0.004). Moreover, a significant negative correlation between T1ρ and histological myelin content measurements was observed (r = -0.57, <i>p</i> = 0.02).

40564755,"The Many Faces of Child Abuse: How Clinical, Genetic and Epigenetic Correlates Help Us See the Full Picture.","Child abuse is a pervasive global issue with significant implications for the physical, emotional, and psychological well-being of victims. This review highlights the clinical, molecular, and therapeutic dimensions of child abuse, emphasizing its long-term impact and the need for interdisciplinary approaches. Early exposure to abuse activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to chronic cortisol release and subsequent neuroplastic changes in brain regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex. These molecular alterations, including epigenetic modifications and inflammatory responses, contribute to the heightened risk of psychiatric disorders and chronic illnesses in survivors. Clinically, child abuse presents with diverse manifestations ranging from physical injuries to psychological and developmental disorders, making timely diagnosis challenging. A multidisciplinary approach involving thorough clinical evaluation, detailed histories, and collaboration with child protection services is essential for accurate diagnosis and effective intervention. Recent advances in molecular biology have identified biomarkers, such as stress-related hormones and epigenetic changes, which provide novel insights into the physiological impact of abuse and potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Current treatment strategies prioritize the child's safety, psychological well-being, and prevention of further abuse. Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy and family-centered interventions are pivotal in promoting recovery and resilience. Emerging research focuses on integrating molecular findings with clinical practice, utilizing digital health tools, and leveraging big data to develop predictive models and personalized treatments. Interdisciplinary collaboration remains crucial to translating research into policy and practice, ultimately aiming to mitigate the impact of child abuse and improve outcomes for survivors.","Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Enrico Parano; Vito Pavone; Martino Ruggieri; Iside Castagnola; Giuseppe Ettore; Gaia Fusto; Roberta Rizzo; Piero Pavone
40564752,Education Improves Perceived Control but Not Risk Identification in Adolescents Regarding Fentanyl.,"In 2022, 2.2 million adolescents were diagnosed with substance use disorders, including 265,000 with opioid use disorder. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health revealed that 130,000 adolescents misused prescription pain medications, often obtaining them from friends or relatives. This age group perceives weekly heroin use as less risky than those younger or older. A questionnaire was developed for 7th to 12th graders in a rural Texas school district as part of a fentanyl awareness curriculum. The questionnaire included Likert scale, multiple choice, and yes/no questions. The participants were categorized into younger (grades 7th and 8th) and older students (grades 9th through 12th), and associations were explored between demographic characteristics, responses, and grade groups using chi-square tests. To assess confidence, behavior, and the impact of education, we used chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. The participants (<i>n</i> = 94; 85.11%) identified as Hispanic or Latino, with a smaller percentage identifying as White or more than one race. An association was found between feeling more in control of actions related to substances and fentanyl (<i>p</i>-value = 0.04) after receiving education. No association was found between education and confidence in identifying fentanyl. This study aligns with a surge in fentanyl-related overdose deaths in a high-intensity drug trafficking region. Recent fentanyl overdoses among school-age children prompted legislative changes in 2023, making this study valuable for understanding the epidemic within the geographical context. These results suggest that school-based education may play a role in strengthening adolescents' behavioral intentions to fentanyl exposure, though additional efforts are needed to improve risk identification.","Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Christine Bakos-Block; Francine R Vega; Marylou Cardenas-Turanzas; Bhanumathi Gopal; Tiffany Champagne-Langabeer
40564745,The Role of Caregivers in Supporting Personal Recovery in Youth with Mental Health Concerns.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Mental disorders that emerge during adolescence frequently extend into adulthood, predicting poor academic and employment outcomes and heavy societal burdens. Novel efforts to improve youth mental health have transitioned from clinical recovery, typically focused on a cure, to a strength-based approach to wellbeing in supporting youth within mental health services. Mental health scholars have appealed for interventions to adopt an ecological system of care approach that integrates the principal caregivers in a young person's life. Despite preliminary literature indicating the importance of caregivers, little research has focused on the caregiver's role in supporting personal recovery in youth. <b>Methods</b>: This study sought to understand the role of caregivers in youth recovery by employing a qualitative design to inductively analyze the narratives from nine semi-structured interviews with caregivers. Additionally, deductive analysis explored the core five underpinnings of personal recovery connectedness, hope, identity, meaning, and empowerment (CHIME). <b>Results</b>: A thematic analysis of the literature identified five themes: providing unconditional love and positive regard; encouraging connection with peers; co-creating a sense of purpose, meaning, and hope; supporting assertiveness and advocacy; and promoting strength and opportunity for mastery aligning with the CHIME framework. The findings will allow health services to understand caregivers' roles better, thus providing information to guide recovery-oriented and family-centered care.","Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Denise B McKern; Govind Krishnamoorthy; Vicki C Dallinger; Diane Heart; Darryl Maybery

40564707,Significance of Oral Care for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder-A Narrative Literature Review.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition in children that typically involves challenges in cognition, behavior, and communication. While many children with ASD exhibit significant impairments in both verbal and non-verbal communication, the severity and nature of these difficulties can vary widely. In addition to its impact on overall health, ASD also affects oral health, leading to increased vulnerability to dental disease. This narrative review aims to summarize key oral health challenges and care strategies for children with ASD, focusing on clinical risks, behavioral barriers, caregiver roles, and effective interventions. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using four databases-PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar-as well as relevant study registries where applicable. Peer-reviewed articles published in English between 2010 and 2024 were identified using keywords and their synonyms, such as autism spectrum disorder, children, oral care, dental practitioners, and parents. Studies were included based on relevance to oral health challenges and interventions in children diagnosed with ASD. Children with ASD experience a range of sensory sensitivities, attention deficits, hyperactivity, and behavioral resistance, which significantly hinder the performance of adequate oral hygiene practices. These challenges contribute to a lack of effective dental prophylaxis and limited access to regular preventive care, ultimately resulting in poorer oral health outcomes and reduced oral health-related quality of life. Due to the multifaceted characteristics of ASD, children with this condition face significant barriers in accessing appropriate and individualized oral care. This increases their risks of developing oral health disorders, underscoring the need for coordinated efforts between caregivers and dental professionals to improve oral health outcomes in this vulnerable population.","Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Sirma Angelova; Desislava Konstantinova; Anna Nenova-Nogalcheva; Rouzha Pancheva
40564688,Associations Between Eating Disorders and Sociodemographic Factors in Adolescent Patients Since the Start of the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with significant increases in mental-health-related concerns in adolescents, including eating disorders. Disparities in screening, diagnosis, and treatment impact adolescents with eating disorders. This study aimed to describe the patterns in the prevalence and the associations between eating disorder diagnoses and demographic factors in adolescent patients since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. We performed a retrospective cohort study examining adolescent patients (aged 12 to 21) with an eating disorder (ED) diagnosis documented between January 2019 and July 2023 using Epic Systems Corporation's Cosmos, a de-identified dataset aggregated from electronic health record (EHR) data. We examined the differences in demographic factors by utilizing chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests. A total of 82,435 distinct adolescent and young adult patients with eating disorder diagnoses were included in the analytical dataset. The overall prevalence of EDs has increased since 2019. The median age of patients with an ED decreased between 2019 and 2023. There was a decrease in other eating disorder diagnoses and an increase in avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) during the study period. There was a decrease in the proportion of individuals who identified as White and an increase in the proportion of adolescents from historically minoritized racial and ethnic groups (i.e., African American or Black and Hispanic). There was also an increase, during this study period, in the proportion of adolescents with an ED diagnosis who were from more socially vulnerable communities. Our study describes the changes in the prevalence of sociodemographic factors in adolescent patients with EDs since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further studies should address screening, diagnostic, and treatment barriers for EDs in historically underserved communities.","Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Janet Lee; David Miller; Paulina Rugart
40564656,The Incidence of Misdiagnosis in Patients with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.,"<b>Background</b>: Misdiagnosis, defined as the incorrect identification of a condition or the failure to identify a condition altogether, can lead to delayed treatment, unnecessary interventions, and avoidable morbidity and mortality. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a complex pain disorder that is often misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed due to lack of awareness among healthcare providers and variability in diagnostic criteria. <b>Objectives</b>: This study aimed to determine the misdiagnosis rate of hypermobile EDS (hEDS) with psychiatric disorders by physicians who are not board-certified in psychiatry. <b>Methods</b>: Between January 2010 and December 2018, the medical records of 429 patients who were diagnosed with hEDS were reviewed and analyzed. During the process of taking a history, patients were asked if they had previously been told by physicians who were not board-certified in psychiatry that their symptoms were ""in their head"", that they were ""making it up"" or seeking attention, or that they might suffer from Munchausen syndrome by proxy or a factitious disorder, or if such physicians had diagnosed them with conversion disorder. The Brown University Human Research Protection Program determined that the proposed activity was not research involving human subjects. <b>Results</b>: A retrospective chart review was conducted. Among the 429 patients, 405 patients (94.4%) said yes to at least one of the questions, with only 24 patients (5.6%) not having been misdiagnosed with psychiatric illnesses. A total of 378 patients (88%) were told that they were ""making it up"", 326 patients (76%) were told that they were attention-seeking, 286 patients (67%) were diagnosed with conversion disorder, 255 patients (60%) were told that ""it was in their head"", and 16 patients (4%) were diagnosed with Munchausen syndrome by proxy or a factitious disorder. <b>Conclusions</b>: Misdiagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is a pervasive issue with profound implications for patients' physical, mental, and economic well-being. By addressing the underlying causes of misdiagnosis and implementing strategies for improved recognition, the healthcare system can significantly enhance outcomes for individuals who are affected by these complex disorders.","Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Chanbin Lee; Pradeep Chopra
40564632,Untangling the Threads: The Impact of Co-Occurring OCD and ADHD Symptoms for Black and/or Latiné Youth.,"<b>Introduction:</b> Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are neuropsychiatric diagnoses that commonly co-occur, as approximately 25% of youth with OCD also have a diagnosis of ADHD and 11% of youth with ADHD have OCD. Individuals with ADHD and OCD are also commonly treated for symptoms of depression, anxiety, and traumatic experiences. Conversely, Black and Latiné youth in the United States have limited access to culturally responsive providers to address these conditions due to systemic racism; the lower rates of appropriate diagnosis, treatment, and inclusion in research create worsening symptoms of OCD. Thus, we sought to understand how ADHD symptoms affect OCD symptoms and how these comorbid diagnoses, in addition to anxiety disorders, affect reported anxiety, depression, and trauma for Black and/or Latiné teens. <b>Procedures:</b> Participants (<i>N</i> = 48) are Black and/or Latina/é/o youth with ADHD in the United States. Self and parent-report measures were completed for ADHD, anxiety, and depression, and a semi-structured interview was conducted to assess current mental health diagnoses (OCD, ADHD, trauma). <b>Results:</b> A path analysis showed higher levels of ADHD inattentive (ADHDI) symptoms (β = 0.34) were positively associated with obsessions. In contrast, higher ADHD hyperactive/impulsivity symptoms (ADHDHI) (β = -0.11) were negatively associated with obsessions. Neither ADHDI nor ADHDHI symptoms were associated with compulsions. Interestingly, ADHDI (β = 0.33) & obsessions (β = 0.28) were both associated with depression; however, ADHDHI was negatively associated with depression (β = -0.29). Importantly, ADHDI was associated with trauma (β = 0.13) and obsessions were strongly associated with anxiety (β = 0.38). <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings may allow for better screenings and treatments for co-occurring OCD and ADHD symptoms and a greater understanding of the impact depression, anxiety, and trauma have on neurodivergent Black and/or Latiné youth.","Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Terumi S Randle; Laurel N Miskovic; Victoria R Grant O'Daniel; Anjo I Okechukwu; Najiya Shahzad; Kayla C Mkandawire; Madeline Warrick; Zoe R Smith
40564623,Interventions to Promote Civic Engagement Among Youth and Its Outcomes on Mental Health: A Scoping Review.,"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Youth mental health significantly impacts future well-being, with nearly half of mental health disorders emerging during adolescence. Civic engagement is defined as active participation in the community to improve conditions for others or to help shape the community's future. It offers a unique opportunity to enhance youth mental well-being, acting as a protective factor against mental health struggles. In this line, Relational Developmental Systems Theory posits that positive youth development is positively linked to civic engagement. The main objective of this literature-based paper is to identify, select, assess, and synthesize the existing literature on interventions promoting mental health in the youth through civic engagement, resulting in an up-to-date review. <b>Methods</b>: Following PRISMA guidelines, a search was conducted using PsycInfo, Scopus, and Web of Science to gather studies published between 2018 and 2023, based on the combination of key terms: (""civic engagement"" OR ""social participation"") AND (""mental health"" OR ""psychological adjustment"" OR ""well-being"") AND (adolescen* OR teen* OR youth OR ""young people"") AND (program* OR intervention OR training OR education). Data extraction and risk-of-bias assessments were performed. <b>Results</b>: Ten studies were included in this review which suggest that civic engagement programs improve youth mental health outcomes, including reduced anxiety, reduced sadness, and increased resilience. These programs foster empowerment, sense of belonging, and social connections, while also enhancing interpersonal skills and career aspirations. Youth also gain valuable skills such as leadership, communication, and problem-solving, contributing to educational and vocational growth. However, challenges such as socio-economic barriers and attendance issues can impact some outcomes, with variations in effectiveness across programs. <b>Conclusions</b>: Youth civic engagement programs should integrate mental health support to mitigate the emotional costs of activism, ensuring greater participation and well-being. It is important to adapt these programs to local contexts and provide flexibility to strengthen participation and community impact. Future research should explore the role of cultural, gender, and socio-economic factors in shaping program outcomes and utilize randomized controlled trials to improve the validity and generalizability of findings.","Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Marina Oubiña López; Diego Gómez Baya
40564612,"Definitions of ""Mental Disorder"" from DSM-III to DSM-5.","The definition of ""mental disorder"" (MD) is one of the most critical themes throughout the history of psychopathology and in the development of the discipline itself. Despite this theme having been addressed since ancient times, the first explicit and shared definition of MD only appeared in the seventies, soon after the first internationally shared nosographies. In this perspective paper, we focused on the definitions of MD proposed in the various versions of the ""Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-DSM"", starting from the third edition of 1980. Over about 40 years, in the various versions of the DSM, six definitions of MD were proposed. We discussed the general matrix/structure of those definitions, as well as the main similarities and/or divergences, and some of the specific constructs and approaches used in such definitions. Additionally, we examined some papers that addressed the same topic in a similar manner and discussed the general debate that accompanied the proposal of the various DSM definitions, the significant attention those definitions attracted, and some minor and major criticisms.","Behavioral sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Mattia Vacca; Alessandro Mura; Gian Pietro Carrogu; Luca Gaviano; Riccardo Atzori; Donatella R Petretto
40564596,Ins and Outs of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) Intervention in Promoting Social Communicative Abilities and Theory of Mind in Children and Adolescents with ASD: A Systematic Review.,"Social-communicative abilities and theory of mind (ToM) are crucial for successful social interactions. The developmental trajectories of social and communicative skills characterizing individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are rather complex and multidimensional, including components related to theory of mind. Due to its mentalistic nature, theory of mind has been rarely addressed as an outcome for Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) intervention in children and adolescents with ASD. However, there is evidence that ABA intervention might be effective in promoting social abilities in individuals with ASD. Thus, this topic is worth investigating. We present a systematic review to explore the Ins and Outs of an ABA approach to promote social and communicative abilities and ToM in children and adolescents with ASD. We applied a PRISMA checklist to consider studies published up to December 2024. The keywords that we used were ToM, perspective-taking, false belief, social cognition, and mental states, in combination with ABA intervention and ASD (up to age 18). We searched for studies using Scopus, Google Scholar, and Medline. We included twenty studies on perspective-taking, identifying emotions, helping, detecting eye gazing, and social engagement, reviewing fifteen dedicated to teaching the interpretation of mental states (involving 49 children and 10 adolescents). The ToM was addressed with a multiple baseline design on target behaviors associated with ToM components such as identifying emotion, helping behaviors, and mental states. The intervention included a behavioral package consisting of Behavioral Skill Training, Derived Relations, video modeling, and role playing. The results indicated a significant number of participants who followed ABA intervention to promote social abilities and mastered the target behavior in ToM tasks; however, they showed maintenance and generalization issues across trials and settings. The role of predictors was highlighted. However, the studies are still rare and exhibit specific methodological limitations, as well as some clinical and ethical considerations. More research is needed to define best practices in ABA intervention to promote social abilities in individuals with ASD.","Behavioral sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Marco Esposito; Roberta Fadda; Orlando Ricciardi; Paolo Mirizzi; Monica Mazza; Marco Valenti
40564567,"Unraveling the Longitudinal Relationships Among Parenting Stress, Preschoolers' Problem Behavior, and Risk of Learning Disorder.","Problem behaviors and the risk of learning disorders in early childhood carry significant implications for children's future development. Understanding the relationship between parenting stress and these developmental outcomes may inform the design of effective interventions to promote healthy child development. The present longitudinal study investigated the association between parenting stress and preschoolers' risk of learning disorders, specifically focusing on the mediating role of problem behaviors. Data were collected at two time points, approximately 6 months apart, from 284 preschool-aged children and their parents (mean age of children at Time 1 = 56.64 months; 53.17% of them were girls). Parents completed standardized assessments of parenting stress, children's problem behaviors, and the risk of learning disorders. An autoregressive cross-lagged panel model within a half-longitudinal framework was employed to test the hypothesized mediation model. Results revealed that parenting stress had a direct effect on both children's problem behaviors and their risk of learning disorders. Moreover, children's problem behaviors partially mediated the longitudinal association between parenting stress and learning disorder risk. Specifically, the indirect effect size was statistically significant (<i>β</i> = 0.022, <i>p</i> = 0.025), indicating that increased parenting stress contributed to approximately a 2.2% increase in the risk of learning disorders through elevated problem behaviors. Theoretically, these findings underscore the critical role of child behavioral adjustment as a mechanism through which parenting stress may influence developmental risk. The results highlight the potential benefits of reducing parenting stress and addressing children's behavioral difficulties to prevent early learning problems. However, the study relied exclusively on parent-reported data, which may introduce shared method variance and reporting bias; future research should incorporate multiple informants and objective behavioral assessments.","Behavioral sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Jie Huang; Dongqing Yu; Xiaoxue Tang; Yili Xu; Xiao Zhong; Xiaoqian Lai
40564541,Social Cognition in Suicidal Behavior in Psychosis: A Systematic Review.,"Suicide is a major concern worldwide, especially in psychotic disorders that have an increased risk for suicidal behavior (SB). There are many well-established risk factors for SB in psychosis. Still, others, such as the domains of social cognition (SC)-the theory of mind, social perception, emotional processing, and attributional style-are unclarified. We aim to review evidence on SC and SB in psychosis and clarify their relationship, examining the differences between SC domains and the potential mediating variables in this relationship and proposing that worse performance in regard to SC is related to a higher risk of suicide. We searched databases for papers on SC and SB published between 2009 and 2024, resulting in the 18 articles included in this systematic review. Individuals with psychotic disorders and SB showed better emotional processing for basic emotional recognition-although they performed poorly on more complex tasks-and exhibited greater empathy within the affective theory of mind. Cognitive biases associated with attributional style and increased distrust as part of social perception were also found. Our findings cannot establish a relationship with the cognitive theory of mind. So, further studies are needed to integrate all domains of SC in longitudinal studies and examine the mediating variables of these relationships.","Behavioral sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,María Carcedo Herrero; Aina Sastre-Buades; Maria Luisa Barrigón
40564527,Phubbing Behaviour: A Bibliometric Analysis of Scientific Production.,"Phubbing refers to the act of ignoring someone in a face-to-face conversation by paying more attention to a mobile phone. This practice, although common, has been identified as harmful and deserves to be considered a problem. As a result, it has captured the attention of the scientific community, with a significant increase in studies in recent years. However, there is a lack of bibliometric analyses examining existing research on this topic, which would be useful in guiding future studies. This article seeks to fill that gap by providing a detailed bibliometric analysis of phubbing. It analyses the entire production in the Web of Science database between 1985 and 2022 (199 articles and 82 keywords). The study employs citation, co-occurrence, and co-citation analysis techniques using scientific maps created with VOSviewer software. The results indicate that most research has focused on how phubbing affects romantic relationships, with less emphasis on other types of relationships such as family, work, or friends. Areas that require further research are identified, such as motivations for internet use, the tendency to compare oneself on social networks, impulsivity, and the influence of executive functions on phubbing. Further exploration of the relationship between phubbing and other disorders is also suggested. This analysis will serve as a guide and stimulus for future research, offering valuable resources for professionals in psychology, health, and education.","Behavioral sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Ana Cebollero-Salinas; Begoña Gutiérrez-Nieto; Jacobo Cano-Escoriaza
40564472,Anatomical Characteristics Predict Response to Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS): Development of a Computational Pipeline for Optimizing tDCS Protocols.,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique promisingly used to treat neurological and psychological disorders. Nevertheless, the inter-subject heterogeneity in its after-effects frequently limits its efficacy. This can be attributed to fixed-dose methods, which do not consider inter-subject anatomical variations. This work attempts to overcome this constraint by examining the effects of age and anatomical features, including the volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the thickness of the skull, and the composition of brain tissue, on electric field distribution and cortical excitability. A computational approach was used to map the electric field distribution over the brain tissues of realistic head models reconstructed from MRI images of twenty-three subjects, including adults and children of both genders. Significant negative correlations (<i>p</i> < 0.05) were found in the data between the maximum electric field strength and anatomical variable parameters. Furthermore, this study showed that the percentage of brain tissue exposed to an electric field amplitude above a pre-defined threshold (i.e., 0.227 V/m) was the main factor influencing the responsiveness to tDCS. In the end, the research suggests multiple regression models as useful tool to predict subjects' responsiveness and to support a personalized approach that tailors the injected current to the morphology of the patient.","Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Giulia Caiani; Emma Chiaramello; Marta Parazzini; Eleonora Arrigoni; Leonor J Romero Lauro; Alberto Pisoni; Serena Fiocchi
40564444,Spiking Neural Networks for Multimodal Neuroimaging: A Comprehensive Review of Current Trends and the NeuCube Brain-Inspired Architecture.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionising neuroimaging by enabling automated analysis, predictive analytics, and the discovery of biomarkers for neurological disorders. However, traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) face challenges in processing spatiotemporal neuroimaging data due to their limited temporal memory and high computational demands. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain's biological processes, offer a promising alternative. SNNs use discrete spikes for event-driven communication, making them energy-efficient and well suited for the real-time processing of dynamic brain data. Among SNN architectures, NeuCube stands out as a powerful framework for analysing spatiotemporal neuroimaging data. It employs a 3D brain-like structure to model neural activity, enabling personalised modelling, disease classification, and biomarker discovery. This paper explores the advantages of SNNs and NeuCube for multimodal neuroimaging analysis, including their ability to handle complex spatiotemporal patterns, adapt to evolving data, and provide interpretable insights. We discuss applications in disease diagnosis, brain-computer interfaces, and predictive modelling, as well as challenges such as training complexity, data encoding, and hardware limitations. Finally, we highlight future directions, including hybrid ANN-SNN models, neuromorphic hardware, and personalised medicine. Our contributions in this work are as follows: (i) we give a comprehensive review of an SNN applied to neuroimaging analysis; (ii) we present current software and hardware platforms, which have been studied in neuroscience; (iii) we provide a detailed comparison of performance and timing of SNN software simulators with a curated ADNI and other datasets; (iv) we provide a roadmap to select a hardware/software platform based on specific cases; and (v) finally, we highlight a project where NeuCube has been successfully used in neuroscience. The paper concludes with discussions of challenges and future perspectives.","Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Omar Garcia-Palencia; Justin Fernandez; Vickie Shim; Nicola Kirilov Kasabov; Alan Wang
40564379,A 3D SVZonChip Model for In Vitro Mimicry of the Subventricular Zone Neural Stem Cell Niche.,"Neural stem cells (NSCs) are crucial components of the nervous system, primarily located in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone (SGZ). The SVZ neural stem cell niche (NSCN) is a specialized microenvironment where growth factors and extracellular matrix (ECM) components collaborate to regulate NSC self-renewal and differentiation. Despite its importance, our understanding of the SVZ remains incomplete due to the inherent challenges of animal research, particularly given the tissue's dynamic nature. To address these limitations, we developed a proof-of-concept, dynamic, and tissue-specific 3D organotypic SVZ model to reduce reliance on animal models. This static 3D organotypic model integrates a region-specific decellularized ECM derived from the SVZ, mimicking the native NSCN and supporting mouse-derived ependymal cells (ECs), radial glial cells (RGCs), astrocytes, and NSCs. To further improve physiological relevance, we incorporated a dynamic microfluidic culture system (SVZonChip), replicating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow as observed in vivo. The resulting SVZonChip platform, combining region-specific ECM proteins with dynamic culture conditions, provides a sustainable and reproducible tool to minimize animal model use. It holds significant promise for studying SVZ-related diseases, such as congenital hydrocephalus, stroke, and post-stroke neurogenesis, while advancing translational research and enabling personalized medicine protocols.","Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Ioannis Angelopoulos; Konstantinos Ioannidis; Konstantina Gr Lyroni; Dimitris Vlassopoulos; Martina Samiotaki; Eleni Pavlidou; Xanthippi Chatzistavrou; Ioannis Papantoniou; Konstantinos Papageorgiou; Spyridon K Kritas; Ioannis Grivas
40564211,Enteroviral Transverse Myelitis Presenting as Acute Ataxia in Children: A Case Series.,"<b>Background</b>: Enteroviruses, members of the <i>Picornaviridae</i> family, typically cause asymptomatic or mild infections. However, they can also result in central nervous system (CNS) involvement, with transverse myelitis (TM) occurring only on rare occasions. TM is a syndrome characterized by acute or subacute spinal cord dysfunction, leading to neurological deficits below the level of the lesion. <b>Case report</b>: We report a case series of eight pediatric patients admitted over a three-month period, June to August 2024. All patients presented with ataxia and/or other neurological symptoms, alongside abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings. Although ataxia is commonly associated with cerebellitis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in this cohort revealed findings consistent with TM. Notably, all patients demonstrated similar MRI abnormalities. The onset of symptoms occurred over a short time during an enterovirus epidemic. Enteroviral RNA was detected, or the virus was isolated in seven patients, while one patient had a close epidemiological link to the virus. All patients achieved full recovery following immunomodulatory therapy. <b>Conclusions</b>: This case series underscores that ataxia may be an atypical symptom associated with TM. Furthermore, there was a notable distinction between the clinical presentation and neuroradiological findings. Immunomodulatory therapy with immunoglobulins and corticosteroids has been shown to be effective and safe, supporting the hypothesis of an immune-mediated pathogenesis in these patients.",Biomedicines,2025,Luka Švitek; Dominik Ljubas; Nina Krajcar; Maja Vrdoljak Pažur; Ana Tripalo Batoš; Irena Tabain; Srđan Roglić; Lorna Stemberger Marić
40564183,Next-Generation Drug Delivery for Neurotherapeutics: The Promise of Stimuli-Triggered Nanocarriers.,"Nanotherapeutics have emerged as novel unparalleled drug delivery systems (DDSs) for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.

In recent years, the developed, stimuli-responsive nanocarriers stand out as novel complex DDSs ensuring selective and specific drug delivery in response to different endogenous and exogenous stimuli. Due to the multifaceted pathophysiology of the nervous system, a major challenge in modern neuropharmacology is the development of effective therapies ensuring high efficacy and low toxicity. Functionalization of the nanocarriers to react to specific microenvironmental changes in the nervous system tissues or external stimulations significantly enhances the efficacy of drug delivery.

40564150,Analysis of Energy Metabolism and Lipid Spatial Distribution in Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy Revealed by MALDI-MSI.,"<b>Background:</b> Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a major cause of neonatal death and neurodevelopmental disorders, and its pathological mechanisms are closely related to disturbed energy metabolism and lipid remodeling. Exploring the spatial heterogeneity of metabolomics is essential to analyze the pathological process of HIE. <b>Methods:</b> In this study, we established a neonatal mouse hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) model by the modified Rice method, and analyzed various metabolic pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, purine metabolism, and lipid metabolism in the ischemic edema area, with contralateral and control brain tissues using matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) with a spatial resolution of 50 μm. <b>Results:</b> In the HIBD model, key metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (citrate, succinate, L-glutamate, glucose, aspartate, and glutamine) were significantly enriched in the edematous area compared with the control (fold change: 1.52-2.82), which suggests a blockage of mitochondrial function; ATP/ADP/AMP levels were reduced by 53-73% in the edematous area, and xanthine was abnormally accumulated in the hippocampus of the affected side, suggesting energy depletion and altered purine metabolism; lipid remodeling showed regional specificity: some unsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid, were abnormally accumulated in the hippocampus. In contrast, pentadecanoic acid levels were reduced across the entire brain in the HIBD model, with a more pronounced decrease in the ipsilateral hippocampus, suggesting impaired membrane stability. <b>Conclusions:</b> The neonatal mouse HIBD model exhibits reprogramming of energy metabolism, characterized by a blockage in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and ATP depletion, along with an abnormal spatial distribution of lipids. By targeting xanthine metabolic pathways, restoring mitochondrial function, and intervening in region-specific lipid remodeling, brain energy homeostasis may be improved and neurological damage attenuated. Further studies should validate the clinical feasibility of xanthine and lipid imbalance as diagnostic markers of HIBD and explore the critical time window for metabolic intervention to optimize therapeutic strategies.",Biomedicines,2025,Xingxing Zhao; Peipei Chen; Lun Yu; Chuchu Gao; Sannan Wang; Zuming Yang; Zongtai Feng
40564138,"Computational Neuroscience's Influence on Autism Neuro-Transmission Research: Mapping Serotonin, Dopamine, GABA, and Glutamate.","Autism spectrum disorder is a complex and diverse neurobiological condition. Understanding the mechanisms and causes of the disorder requires an in-depth study and modeling of the immune, mitochondrial, and neurological systems. Computational neuroscience enhances psychiatric science by employing machine learning techniques on neural networks, combining data on brain activity with the pathophysiological and biological characteristics of psychiatric-neurobiological disorders. The research explores the integration of neurotransmitter activity into computational models and their potential roles in diagnosing and treating autism using computational methods. This research employs a narrative review that focuses on four neurotransmitter systems directly related to the manifestation of autism, specifically the following neurotransmitters: serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). This study reveals that computational neuroscience advances autism diagnosis and treatment by identifying genetic factors and improving the efficiency of diagnosis. Neurotransmitters play a crucial role in the function of brain cells, enhancing synaptic conduction and signal transmission. However, the interaction of chemical compounds with genetic factors and network alterations influences the pathophysiology of autism.

40564109,Advances in Autophagy-Lysosomal Pathway and Neurodegeneration via Brain-Gut Axis.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> The autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) is crucial for neuronal health by clearing misfolded proteins and damaged organelles. While much research has focused on ALP dysfunction in the central nervous system, new evidence shows its importance in the gut, where it affects neurodegeneration via the gut-brain axis. Past reviews have mainly studied the ALP's direct neuroprotective effects or the gut microbiota's role in neurodegeneration separately. However, the two-way relationship between the ALP and the gut microbiota in neurodegenerative diseases is not well understood. We combine the latest findings on the ALP's role in gut health, microbial imbalance, and neuroinflammation, providing a comprehensive view of their combined effects in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. <b>Methods:</b> This narrative review synthesizes evidence from preclinical, clinical, and translational studies (2014-2025) to explore the interplay between the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) and the gut-brain axis in neurodegeneration. The literature was identified via PubMed and Web of Science using search terms including autophagy, lysosome, gut microbiota, neurodegeneration, and gut-brain axis, with additional manual screening of reference lists. The inclusion criteria prioritized studies elucidating molecular mechanisms (e.g., ALP-microbiota crosstalk), while excluding case reports or non-peer-reviewed sources. <b>Results:</b> The gut-brain axis facilitates bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain through neural, immune, and metabolic pathways. Autophagy dysfunction may disrupt intestinal homeostasis, promote gut microbiota dysbiosis, and trigger chronic neuroinflammation, ultimately accelerating neurodegeneration. Notably, strategies targeting the gut microbiota and restoring intestinal barrier function via the ALP have demonstrated promising potential in delaying the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. <b>Conclusions:</b> This review establishes the ALP as a dynamic regulator of gut-brain communication, highlighting microbiota-targeted therapies as promising strategies for neurodegeneration.",Biomedicines,2025,Ping Yao; Hailong Han
40564095,Role of Cav1.3 Channels in Brain-Heart Interactions: An Unexpected Journey.,"The intricate brain-heart interaction, essential for physiological balance, is largely governed by the autonomic nervous system (ANS). This bidirectional communication, involving both the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the ANS, is critical for maintaining cardiac homeostasis. Dysregulation of the ANS is a significant factor in cardiovascular diseases. Beyond the ANS, higher brain functions, particularly through interoceptive prediction, contribute to this dynamic interplay. The Cav1.3 L-type calcium channel, expressed in both the central nervous system (CNS) and the heart, is crucial for this interaction. Cav1.3, a key regulator of cellular excitability, exhibits genetic variations that are linked to both neurological and cardiac disorders, highlighting its pivotal role in the brain-heart axis. This review aims to delve into the under-explored role of Cav1.3 in brain-heart interaction, specifically examining how it modulates ANS activity and, consequently, the cardiac function. This will illuminate its significant role in the broader context of brain-heart interactions.",Biomedicines,2025,Jean-Baptiste Reisqs; Yvonne Sleiman; Michael Cupelli; Mohamed Boutjdir
40564077,"Gut Feelings: How Microbes, Diet, and Host Immunity Shape Disease.","The human gut microbiome is intricately linked to systemic and organ-specific immune responses and is highly responsive to dietary modulation. As metagenomic techniques enable in-depth study of an ever-growing number of gut microbial species, it has become increasingly feasible to decipher the specific functions of the gut microbiome and how they may be modulated by diet. Diet exerts both supportive and selective pressures on the gut microbiome by regulating a multitude of factors, including energy density, macronutrient and micronutrient content, and circadian rhythm. The microbiome, in turn, contributes to local and systemic immune responses by providing colonization resistance against pathogens, shaping immune cell activity and differentiation, and facilitating the production of bioactive metabolites. Emerging research has strengthened the connections between the gut microbiome and cardiometabolic disorders (e.g., cardiovascular disease, obesity, type-2 diabetes), autoimmune conditions (e.g., type-1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease), respiratory disease, chronic kidney and liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and neurological disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, depressive disorders).

40563990,"Palmitoylethanolamide: A Multifunctional Molecule for Neuroprotection, Chronic Pain, and Immune Modulation.","Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an endogenous lipid mediator belonging to the N-acyl-ethanolamine family, widely recognized for its multifaceted effects on neuroprotection, chronic pain management, and immune modulation. As a naturally occurring compound, PEA plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis under conditions of cellular stress and inflammation. Its pharmacological effects are primarily mediated through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-α) activation, alongside indirect modulation of cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, as well as interactions with novel targets such as GPR55 and TRPV1. These molecular mechanisms underpin its broad therapeutic potential, particularly in the management of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders, pain syndromes, and immune dysregulation. A major advancement in PEA research has been the development of ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide (umPEA), which significantly enhances its bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy by facilitating better tissue absorption and interaction with key molecular pathways. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that umPEA is particularly effective in reducing neuroinflammation, stabilizing mast cells, and enhancing endocannabinoid system activity, making it a promising candidate for integrative approaches in neuropsychiatric and chronic inflammatory diseases. Given its well-established safety profile, umPEA represents an attractive alternative or adjunct to conventional anti-inflammatory and analgesic therapies.

40563900,Role of C-Jun N-Terminal Kinases on a Stressed Epithelium: Time for Testing Isoform Specificity.,"Biological, physiological, and psychological stressors cause a ""stress response"" in our bodies. Stressors that are sensorily perceived (either acute or chronic) trigger hormonal responses from the sympathetic nervous system-the SAM and HPA axis-that effect intended organs to alert the individual. Other stressors have a direct effect on the target organ(s) of the body-e.g., physical injury and wounds, toxins, ionizing, and UV radiation. Both kinds of stressors change cell equilibrium, often leading to reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and cellular damage. Among the signaling pathways involved in fighting these stressors, the c-Jun-N-terminal kinases (JNK) respond to diverse kinds of stressors. This review focuses on JNK1 and JNK2, both of which are ubiquitously present in all cell types, and attention is paid to gastrointestinal tract epithelial cells and their response-including tight junction disruption and cytoskeletal changes. We discuss the seemingly opposite roles of JNK1 and JNK2 in helping cells choose pro-survival and pro-apoptotic pathways. We examine the common features of the JNK protein structure and the possibilities of discovering JNK-isoform-specific inhibitors since, although JNK1 and JNK2 are involved in multiple diseases, including cancer, obesity, diabetes, musculoskeletal and liver disease, no cell-specific or isoform-specific inhibitors are available.",Biology,2025,Nitesh Shashikanth; Osama Alaidi; Lohitha Basa; Shreya Taank; RadhaKrishna Rao; Jayaraman Seetharaman

40563824,An Updated and Comprehensive Review Exploring the Gut-Brain Axis in Neurodegenerative Disorders and Neurotraumas: Implications for Therapeutic Strategies.,"The gut-brain axis (GBA) refers to the biochemical bidirectional communication between the central nervous system (CNS) and the gastrointestinal tract, linking brain and gut functions. It comprises a complex network of interactions involving the endocrine, immune, autonomic, and enteric nervous systems. The balance of this bidirectional pathway depends on the composition of the gut microbiome and its metabolites. While the causes of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) vary, the gut microbiome plays a crucial role in their development and prognosis. NDDs are often associated with an inflammation-related gut microbiome. However, restoring balance to the gut microbiome and reducing inflammation may have therapeutic benefits. In particular, introducing short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, key metabolites that support gut homeostasis, can help counteract the inflammatory microbiome. This strong pathological link between the gut and NDDs underscores the gut-brain axis (GBA) as a promising target for therapeutic intervention. This review, by scrutinizing the more recent original research articles published in PubMed (MEDLINE) database, emphasizes the emerging notion that GBA is an equally important pathological marker for neurological movement disorders, particularly in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease and neurotraumatic disorders such as traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury.

This manuscript reviews the current techniques, including lesion-based procedures and DBS, and explores their mechanisms of action, from synaptic plasticity to large-scale network modulation. It highlights recent progress in neuroimaging, connectomic targeting, and artificial intelligence applications for surgical planning and the prediction of treatment responses. Ethical considerations-including informed consent, identity, and long-term follow-up-are critically examined in light of these advances. Furthermore, the growing role of minimally invasive procedures and wearable integrated neurotechnologies is discussed as part of a shift toward dynamic and adaptive interventions. Although still investigational, psychiatric neurosurgery is emerging as a technologically sophisticated field that demands rigorous clinical evaluation, ethical accountability, and an individualized approach to restoring function and autonomy in some of the most disabling mental illnesses.",Brain sciences,2025,Cristina V Torres Díaz; Marta Navas García; Paloma Pulido Rivas; Mónica Lara Almunia; José Antonio Fernández Alén
40563811,Sleep Deprivation and Alzheimer's Disease: A Review of the Bidirectional Interactions and Therapeutic Potential of Omega-3.,"Sleep is essential for physical and mental health, playing a critical role in memory consolidation, behavioral stability, and the regulation of immune and metabolic functions. The incidence of sleep disorders, particularly sleep deprivation (SD), increases with age and is prevalent in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nearly 40% of AD patients experience significant chronic sleep impairments. The clinical distinction between late-life sleep disorders and AD is often challenging due to overlapping symptoms, including cognitive decline and behavioral impairments. Although the exact causal relationship between SD and AD remains complex and multifaceted, strong evidence suggests a bidirectional link, with AD patients frequently exhibiting disrupted sleep architecture, reduced slow-wave activity, and shorter total sleep duration. On a pathophysiological level, SD contributes to neuroinflammation, amyloid-β plaque deposition, and tau tangles, which are key features of AD. Current treatments, such as sedatives and antidepressants, often have limitations, including inconsistent efficacy, dependency risks, and poor long-term outcomes/recurrence, highlighting the need for safer and more effective alternatives. This review examines the interplay between SD and AD and proposes omega (n)-3 fatty acids (FAs) as a potential therapeutic intervention. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that n-3 supplementation may improve sleep onset/quality, reduce neuroinflammation, support synaptic function, and decrease amyloid-β aggregation, thereby alleviating early AD-related neurological changes. Given their safety profile and neuroprotective effects, n-3 FAs represent a promising strategy for managing the comorbidity of sleep disorders in AD.",Brain sciences,2025,Nasar Ullah Khan Niazi; Jiahui Jiang; Haiyan Ou; Ruiye Chen; Zhiyou Yang
40563809,"Self, Me, or I? Unravelling the Triumvirate of Selfhood in Pathological Consciousness.","In this conceptual review, we explore how alterations in the configuration and expression of the three core aspects of experiential Selfhood-'Self,' 'Me', and 'I'-both reflect and shape an individual's susceptibility to neuropsychopathology. Drawing on empirical neurophenomenological evidence and theoretical insights, we examine a range of psychiatric and neurological disorders through the lens of the Selfhood triumvirate. Our findings indicate that, despite variations in the expression of Selfhood aspects across different pathologies, their proportional configuration remains remarkably stable in most conditions, with the 'Self' aspect consistently dominant, followed by the 'Me' aspect, and finally the 'I' aspect. This stability suggests a fundamental neurophenomenological hierarchy in Selfhood organization, which seems to be disrupted only in extreme cases such as vegetative (unresponsive) states and also schizophrenia. Ultimately, we propose that all neuropsychopathologies are best understood as disorders of Selfhood, where disruptions in the dynamic balance and configuration of the 'Self', 'Me', and 'I' aspects accompany neurophenomenological manifestations in distinct dysfunctions and pathologies.",Brain sciences,2025,Alexander A Fingelkurts; Andrew A Fingelkurts
40563792,The Rapid Sense of Direction (R-SOD) Scale: A Brief Self-Report Tool to Identify Developmental Topographical Disorientation (DTD).,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Developmental Topographical Disorientation (DTD) refers to a condition in which individuals report getting lost in very familiar surroundings, since childhood, with no other cognitive complaints, and no brain injuries or neurological disorders. While the cognitive and neurological mechanisms underlying DTD are being investigated, to date, there is no tool available to the public and health practitioners for identifying this lifelong condition. <b>Methods</b>: Here, we used a decade of data (<i>N</i> = 3794) collected in healthy and DTD individuals to produce a short and reliable measure of self-reported sense of direction that could point to the presence of DTD. <b>Results</b>: We adopted a measure of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) and identified four items of the well-known Santa Barbara Sense of Direction (SBSOD) Scale that retain its original strong internal consistency. These four items remain sensitive to the well-known effects of sex on spatial orientation and, importantly, to the presence of DTD, while maintaining the same pattern of association with a cognitive battery of computerized tasks measuring different spatial abilities. <b>Conclusions</b>: This four-item measure could be of practical use to obtain a rapid assessment of an individual's self-reported sense of direction and help to identify the presence of DTD in the general population.",Brain sciences,2025,Tejdeep Jaswal; Ford Burles; Giuseppe Iaria
40563776,"Suicide, Psychoactive Substances, and Homelessness: A Scoping Review.","The homeless population (HP) is a heterogeneous group characterized by the absence of stable and conventional housing, often relying on public spaces and deteriorated environments for shelter and survival, either temporarily or permanently. This group is exposed to multiple health vulnerabilities, with substance use disorder (SUD) identified as a significant risk factor for suicidal behavior. The aim of this study was to conduct a scoping review of the relationship between PAS use and suicide among homeless individuals. A comprehensive literature search was performed using five databases: PubMed, Scopus, SciELO, LILACS, and Google Scholar. Studies were selected based on their relevance to the topic, and data were extracted regarding substance use, suicide-related outcomes, and associated sociodemographic and clinical factors. The findings indicated a strong association between PAS use and increased suicidal ideation and behavior among homeless individuals, particularly among youth, men, and women. Opioids and alcohol were the most frequently reported substances in this context. Additional factors such as unemployment, exposure to violence, social inequalities, and mental health disorders further exacerbated the risk of suicide in this population Conclusions: The reviewed literature underscores the urgent need for integrated, context-sensitive interventions addressing both substance use and mental health among the homeless. Tailored public health strategies focused on prevention, harm reduction, and psychosocial support are essential to reducing suicide risk and promoting overall well-being in this highly vulnerable group.",Brain sciences,2025,Dalvan Antonio de Campos; Adriano Alberti; Carlos Eduardo Seganfredo Camargo; Andréia Biolchi Mayer; João Batista de Oliveira Junior; Nayara Lisboa Almeida Schonmeier; Rose Lampert; Gabriela Kades; Bruna Becker da Silva; Graziela Marques Leão; Duanne Alves Pereira Crivilim; Ben Hur Soares; Josiane Aparecida de Jesus; Eloel Benetti Zavorski; Renan Souza; Risoni Pereira Dias de Carvalho; Ana Patricia Alves Vieira; Lília Aparecida Kanan; Natalia Veronez da Cunha
40563762,Heterosexual Intimate Partner Femicide: A Narrative Review of Victim and Perpetrator Characteristics.,"<b>Background:</b> Intimate partner femicide (IPF) is the most common form of femicide and a severe expression of gender-based violence, highlighting persistent gender inequality worldwide. Addressing this major public health concern requires a comprehensive synthesis of existing evidence to inform prevention strategies. This review aims to identify risk factors for IPF and explore the demographic, behavioral, and psychosocial characteristics of victims and perpetrators. <b>Methods:</b> A narrative review was conducted using a systematic literature search in Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed, following PRISMA guidelines. Studies were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Out of 1200 identified records, 51 met the criteria and were included. Data extraction and analysis were conducted independently by two reviewers. Findings are presented narratively. <b>Results:</b> The review identified multiple risk factors for IPF. Victims were more likely to be married, with a history of psychological and physical abuse as well as substance use. Perpetrators were typically older, with higher rates of unemployment, psychiatric disorders, and substance use. Common precipitating factors included jealousy, separation, and recurrent conflicts. Weapon use-particularly knives and firearms-and ""overkill"" were frequent. Perpetrators often exhibited stalking behaviors and a history of intimate partner violence. Compared to other homicide offenders, IPF perpetrators were generally older, more often employed, and less likely to have a criminal background, but more likely to engage in intimate partner violence and hold patriarchal beliefs. <b>Conclusions:</b> IPF is not an unpredictable act. Despite the heterogeneity among perpetrators, identifiable risk indicators can inform effective prevention and intervention efforts.",Brain sciences,2025,Anastasia Koureta; Manolis Gaganakis; Eleni Georgiadou; Vasilios P Bozikas; Agorastos Agorastos
40563755,The Role of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in Chronic Shoulder Pain: A Scoping Review.,"Chronic shoulder pain is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder often associated with central sensitisation, which limits the effectiveness of conventional therapies. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has emerged as a non-invasive neuromodulatory intervention to modulate cortical excitability and potentially improve pain and functional outcomes. This scoping review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) framework and PRISMA-ScR guidelines. A systematic search was conducted across MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Scopus, PEDro, and Web of Science to identify studies evaluating the effects of tDCS on pain and function in adults with rotator cuff disorders, myofascial pain syndrome (MPS), or subacromial pain syndrome (SAPS). Data were extracted and synthesised qualitatively. Four studies met the inclusion criteria. tDCS demonstrated variable efficacy: some trials reported no additional benefit when used alongside corticosteroid injections or sensorimotor training (e.g., SAPS and rotator cuff tendinopathy), while others showed enhanced pain reduction and functional gains, particularly in MPS. Targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) appeared more effective than stimulating the primary motor cortex (M1) in modulating pain. Functional improvements were generally observed, though not consistently superior to sham interventions. Preliminary evidence suggests that tDCS may represent a promising adjunctive treatment for chronic shoulder pain, particularly in MPS. However, due to the limited number of studies and heterogeneity in methods, conclusions should be interpreted with caution. However, heterogeneity in study protocols, stimulation targets, and patient populations limits conclusive recommendations. Standardised protocols and larger trials are needed to determine the optimal application of tDCS in clinical shoulder pain management.",Brain sciences,2025,Roberto Tedeschi; Federica Giorgi; Danilo Donati
40563747,Coping Styles and Defense Mechanisms in Healthy Young Adults-Correlations with tPA-BDNF Pathway.,"An increasing number of studies are exploring how stress influences the development of various psychiatric and physical disorders. Psychological coping strategies and defense mechanisms play a vital role in managing stress. However, the biological mechanisms involved in coping with stress have not been thoroughly researched. This study focuses on the relationships between plasma levels of tPA-BDNF pathway proteins and their correlations with coping strategies and defense mechanisms. The study involved 48 healthy young adults. All participants completed the self-reported Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ-40) and Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory (COPE). BDNF, proBDNF, t-plasminogen activator/tPA, total serpin E1/PAI-1, serpin F2/alpha 2-antiplasmin, and MMP-9 plasma concentrations were determined using ELISA. We detected higher BDNF and lower MMP-9 levels in females. We found differences in the DSQ-40 humor subdimension and in the COPE focus on and venting of emotions category between women and men. We found correlations between studied protein plasma concentrations. Positive correlations of total serpin E1/PAI-1 with denial and mental disengagement and negative correlations with some active coping categories were found. Correlations of DSQ-40 scores with BDNF, proBDNF, MMP-9, and total serpin E1/PAI-1 were detected. Our findings indicate that there are functional associations between the proteins we studied and various coping styles, as well as mature, immature, and neurotic defense mechanisms.",Brain sciences,2025,Julia Pilecka; Jedrzej Wojciechowski; Weronika Bargiel; Maria Terczynska; Przemyslaw Zakowicz; Dawid Bojarski; Karolina Wasicka-Przewozna; Maria Skibinska
40563746,Rapid Eye Movements in Sleep Furnish a Unique Probe into the Ontogenetic and Phylogenetic Development of the Visual Brain: Implications for Autism Research.,"With positron emission tomography followed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we demonstrated that rapid eye movements (REMs) in sleep are saccades that scan dream imagery. The brain ""sees"" essentially the same way while awake and while dreaming in REM sleep. As expected, an event-related fMRI study (events = REMs) showed activation time-locked to REMs in sleep (""REM-locked"" activation) in the oculomotor circuit that controls saccadic eye movements and visual attention. More crucially, the fMRI study provided a series of unexpected findings, including REM-locked multisensory integration. REMs in sleep index the processing of endogenous visual information and the hierarchical generation of dream imagery through multisensory integration. The neural processes concurrent with REMs overlap extensively with those reported to be atypical in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Studies on ASD have shown atypical visual processing and multisensory integration, emerging early in infancy and subsequently developing into autistic symptoms. MRI studies of infants at high risk for ASD are typically conducted during natural sleep. Simply timing REMs may improve the accuracy of early detection and identify markers for stratification in heterogeneous ASD patients. REMs serve as a task-free probe useful for studying both infants and animals, who cannot comply with conventional visual activation tasks. Note that REM-probe studies would be easier to implement in early infancy because REM sleep, which is markedly preponderant in the last trimester of pregnancy, is still pronounced in early infancy. The brain may practice seeing the world during REM sleep in utero before birth. The REM-probe controls the level of attention across both the lifespan and typical-atypical neurodevelopment. Longitudinal REM-probe studies may elucidate how the brain develops the ability to ""see"" and how this goes awry in autism. REMs in sleep may allow a straightforward comparison of animal and human data. REM-probe studies of animal models of autism have great potential. This narrative review puts forth every reason to believe that employing REMs as a probe into the development of the visual brain will have far-reaching implications.",Brain sciences,2025,Charles Chong-Hwa Hong
40563743,Preliminary Electroencephalography-Based Assessment of Anxiety Using Machine Learning: A Pilot Study.,"<b>Background</b>: Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) have significantly influenced the analysis of brain signals, particularly electroencephalography (EEG), enhancing the detection of complex neural patterns. ML enables large-scale data processing, offering novel opportunities for diagnosing and treating mental disorders. However, challenges such as data variability, noise, and model interpretability remain significant. This study reviews the current limitations of EEG-based anxiety detection and explores the potential of advanced AI models, including transformers and VAE-D2GAN, to improve diagnostic accuracy and real-time monitoring. <b>Methods</b>: The paper presents the application of ML algorithms, with a focus on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN), in identifying biomarkers of anxiety disorders and predicting therapy responses. Additionally, it discusses the role of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in assisting individuals with disabilities by enabling device control through brain activity. <b>Results</b>: Experimental EEG research on BCI applications was conducted, focusing on motor imagery-based brain activity. Findings indicate that successive training sessions improve signal classification accuracy, emphasizing the need for personalized and adaptive EEG analysis methods. Challenges in BCI usability and technological constraints in EEG processing are also addressed. <b>Conclusions</b>: By integrating ML with EEG analysis, this study highlights the potential for future healthcare applications, including neurorehabilitation, anxiety disorder therapy, and predictive clinical models.

40563742,Extracellular Vesicles and Purinergic Signaling in Alzheimer's Disease-Joining Forces for Novel Therapeutic Approach.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), are a global problem affecting millions of people. Thanks to years of research and huge efforts, it has been possible to discover the pathophysiological changes accompanying Alzheimer's disease at the cellular level. It turns out that the formation of amyloid-beta plaques and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein in the brain play a key role in disease development. Purinergic signaling (PS) is implicated in the pathophysiology of several disorders in the central nervous system, and recent findings link some disturbances in PS with Alzheimer's disease. The primary objective of our review is to comprehensively explore and identify key purinergic signaling targets that hold therapeutic potential in the treatment of patients suffering from the disease. In particular, we focus on the dual role of purinergic compounds and extracellular vesicles (EVs), which have emerged as critical components in cellular communication and disease modulation. The extracellular vesicles that are naturally released by various cells fulfill the role of communication tools, also by harnessing the purinergic compounds. In this context, our review presents a thorough and integrative analysis of how extracellular vesicles can influence purinergic signaling and how this interaction might be leveraged to develop novel, targeted treatment strategies. Ultimately, this line of research may lead to innovative therapeutic approaches that are not only effective in slowing or halting disease progression but also demonstrate a high degree of biocompatibility and safety for the human organism.",Brain sciences,2025,Julita Lewandowska; Jakub Majewski; Katarzyna Roszek
40563739,Psychiatric Outcomes of Subthalamic Nucleus Deep Brain Stimulation: A Systematic Review of Short- and Long-Term Effects.,"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a widely used intervention for Parkinson's disease (PD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). While motor and OCD symptom benefits are established, increasing evidence highlights psychiatric side effects. The underlying mechanisms involve stimulation parameters, electrode positioning, and medication adjustments. This systematic review aims to evaluate the short-term and long-term psychiatric effects of STN-DBS and identify influencing factors. <b>Methods</b>: A systematic literature search (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase; 2015-2024) was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Studies examining psychiatric effects of STN-DBS in PD or OCD, reporting quantitative/qualitative psychiatric measures, and specifying stimulation parameters were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for observational studies and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). <b>Results</b>: A total of 16 studies met the inclusion criteria, with sample sizes from 10 to 149 patients and short- to long-term follow-ups (up to 17 years). Short-term effects included transient hypomania, euphoria, increased impulsivity (especially with medial STN stimulation), and sometimes anxiety reduction. Long-term effects showed a tendency towards apathy and depression (apathy increased significantly in one large cohort), particularly linked to ventromedial STN stimulation or dopaminergic medication reduction. Impulse control disorders (ICDs) improved long-term in one study following medication reduction, while impulsivity slightly worsened in another. Verbal fluency decline was commonly reported, though global cognition often remained stable. Psychiatric outcomes (mood/apathy, attention/memory) depended on stimulation location within STN subregions. Higher total electrical energy delivered (TEED) correlated with depressive trait shifts in one study. <b>Conclusions</b>: STN-DBS has complex psychiatric consequences. Electrode positioning, stimulation parameters (including location within STN subregions and possibly TEED), and medication adjustments significantly influence outcomes. Careful patient selection, preoperative psychiatric screening, optimized programming targeting specific STN subregions, and cautious medication management are essential to minimize psychiatric risks while maximizing therapeutic benefits for motor and OCD symptoms.",Brain sciences,2025,Mattia Vittorio Pomes; Giordano D'Urso; Ilaria Bove; Luigi Maria Cavallo; Lorenzo Della Ragione; Carmela Palmiero; Francesco Perrotta; Felice Esposito; Teresa Somma

This study searched empirical studies on cognition and the brain to evaluate which functions have been assessed, with which instruments, and what changes have been documented in brain connectivity after PP. We used the guidelines and checklist of the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews. The literature search was performed on the Medline-PubMed, American Psychological Association-PsycINFO, Elton Bryson Stephens Company, and Cochrane databases, and Google Scholar, including articles on patients with non-psychotic disturbances published from 1980 to September 2024. Fifty-nine articles were collected. Five articles reported on cognitive outcomes. Abstraction and mentalization remained stable after individual PP in patients with adjustment disorders or anorexia nervosa. Executive functions, emotional intelligence, spatial short-term memory, attention, and balance between relatedness and self-definition improved after group PP applied alone or combined with individual PP. Twelve studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, single-photon emission computerized tomography, or electroencephalography showed functional brain changes after different types of PP. An empirical approach has rarely been used to evaluate the impact of PP on the brain and cognition. The results of selected studies on neurotic and depressive disorders suggest that PP can stimulate cognitive function and brain connectivity.

40563541,Ankyrin-G and Its Binding Partners in Neurons: Orchestrating the Molecular Structure of the Axon Initial Segment.,"The axon initial segment (AIS) is a specialized subcellular domain that plays an essential role in action potential initiation and the diffusion barrier. A key organizer of the AIS is Ankyrin-G, a scaffolding protein responsible for clustering voltage-gated ion channels, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), and cytoskeletal components at this critical neuronal domain. Recent proteomic analyses have revealed a complex network of proteins in the AIS, emphasizing Ankyrin-G's central role in its molecular architecture. This review discusses new findings in the study of AIS-associated proteins. It explains how Ankyrin-G and its binding partners (such as ion channels, CAMs, spectrins, actin, and microtubule-associated proteins including end-binding protein 3, tripartite motif-containing protein 46, and calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein 2) organize their structure. Understanding the dynamic regulation and molecular interactions within the AIS offers insights into neuronal excitability and reveals potential therapeutic targets for axonal dysfunction-related diseases. Through these dynamic interactions, Ankyrin-G ensures the proper alignment and dense clustering of key channel complexes, thereby maintaining the AIS's distinctive molecular and functional identity. By further unraveling the complexity of Ankyrin-G's interactome, our understanding of AIS formation, maintenance, and plasticity will be considerably enhanced, contributing to the elucidation of the pathogenesis of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.",Biomolecules,2025,Xiaowei Zhu; Yanyan Yu; Zhuqian Jiang; Yoshinori Otani; Masashi Fujitani
40563525,Cardiac Glycosides: From Natural Defense Molecules to Emerging Therapeutic Agents.,"Cardiac glycosides (CGs), a class of plant- and animal-derived compounds historically used to treat heart failure, have garnered renewed interest for their diverse pharmacological properties beyond Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (NKA) inhibition. Recent studies reveal that CGs modulate key signaling pathways-such as NF-κB, PI3K/Akt, JAK/STAT, and MAPK-affecting processes central to cancer, viral infections, immune regulation, and neurodegeneration. In cancer, CGs induce multiple forms of regulated cell death, including apoptosis, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, and immunogenic cell death, while also inhibiting angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and cell cycle progression. They demonstrate broad-spectrum antiviral activity by disrupting viral entry, replication, and mRNA processing in viruses such as HSV, HIV, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. Immunologically, CGs regulate Th17 differentiation via RORγ signaling, although both inhibitory and agonistic effects have been reported. In the nervous system, CGs modulate neuroinflammation, support synaptic plasticity, and improve cognitive function in models of Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis. Despite their therapeutic potential, clinical translation is hindered by narrow therapeutic indices and systemic toxicity. Advances in drug design and nanocarrier-based delivery are critical to unlocking CGs' full potential as multi-target agents for complex diseases. This review synthesizes the current knowledge on the emerging roles of CGs and highlights strategies for their safe and effective repurposing.",Biomolecules,2025,Arturo Ponce; Catalina Flores-Maldonado; Ruben G Contreras
40563512,A Single-Chain Variable Fragment Antibody Alleviates Inflammation and Apoptosis of Neurons by Inhibiting Tau Aggregation.,"Tau pathology is one of the main pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Intracellular Tau may be released to the extracellular space upon neuron degeneration, where it has the potential to be toxic to other neurons. The propagation of Tau pathology, mediated by extracellular Tau aggregates, may underlie the pathogenesis of AD. Antibody therapies targeting Tau proteins are, therefore, considered highly promising. In this study, the cytotoxicity of extracellular Tau aggregates on SH-SY5Y cells was examined. The effect of extracellular Tau aggregates on intracellular Tau aggregation was also studied using a FRET-based assay. The extracellular Tau aggregates were found to cause intracellular Tau aggregation after entering the cells; meanwhile, ROS (reactive oxygen species) induced by Tau aggregates facilitated this process. A single-chain variable fragment antibody (scFv T1) inhibits Tau aggregation both extracellularly and intracellularly. ScFv T1 also inhibited the accumulation of ROS and alleviated the inflammation and apoptosis induced by Tau aggregates. These findings could provide experimental support for the study of neurotoxicity and related mechanisms of extracellular Tau aggregates, in addition to providing insights into the development of novel therapeutic agents to treat AD.",Biomolecules,2025,Zongbao Wang; Jingye Lin; Peipei Chang; Mingzhu Sun; Sen Li
40563509,Positive Effects of (+)-Epicatechin on Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury Recovery.,"Neurological damage from traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) results in a grade of disability ranging from mild to severe motor and sensory dysfunction. It occurs more frequently in men of productive age. Treatment essentially consists of anti-inflammatories and rehabilitation. Other treatments are only partially effective, and inadequate treatment and secondary conditions often cause premature mortality. The search for pharmacological approaches is a continuous effort. This study aimed to assess the effects of a natural compound on spinal cord injury (SCI) as an alternative damage prevention maneuver. We evaluated the protective effects of the flavanol (+)-epicatechin (EC) in a rat model of moderate trauma-induced SCI on protein markers of damage events. The results showed that EC induced significant protection against SCI. No changes were found in angiopoietin-1, beclin-1, myelin basic protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilament heavy polypeptide, and neuronal nuclear antigen after the injury, suggesting that damage progression was impeded. The reduction in damage translates into better movement. The results suggest that (+)-epicatechin may be a suitable alternative for treating SCI.",Biomolecules,2025,Cristian Gonzalez-Ruiz; Rodrigo Mondragón-Lozano; Hermelinda Salgado-Ceballos; Francisco Villarreal; Yuridia Martínez-Meza; Eduardo Meaney; Nayelli Nájera; Guillermo Ceballos
40563502,Long-Term Exercise Mitigates Energy Expenditure and Inflammatory Responses Induced by Sleep Deprivation in Mice.,"<b>Background</b>: Sleep deprivation (SD), defined as the disruption or loss of normal sleep, negatively affects energy metabolism, immune function, and gut microbiota in both humans and animals. Although SD has detrimental effects, it is often unavoidable due to work or study demands. Exercise has been shown to improve sleep quality, regulate metabolism, and enhance immune function. However, whether exercise can mitigate the adverse effects of unavoidable SD remains unclear. <b>Methods</b>: To explore the protective effects of exercise against SD-induced gut microbiota and metabolic dysfunction, mice were randomly assigned to four groups: control (CTR), exercise (EXE), SD, and exercise + SD (EXE + SD). Inflammatory markers and gut microbiota composition were analyzed to assess the impacts of SD and exercise interventions. <b>Results</b>: The inflammatory levels and energy metabolism in SD mice were significantly increased compared to those in CTR mice. Compared with SD mice, EXE + SD mice had a more stable gut microbiota structure and higher butyrate levels. Meanwhile, the inflammatory response caused by SD was also inhibited by exercise preconditioning. Both lipopolysaccharide inhibitors injection and butyrate supplementation can partially alleviate the elevation of inflammatory response and energy metabolism caused by SD. <b>Conclusion</b>: The inflammation and energy metabolism disorders in mice caused by SD can be inhibited by exercise preconditioning through stabilizing the structure of gut microbiota. This protective effect is highly likely related to the increase in butyric acid levels caused by exercise.",Biomolecules,2025,Tian-Shu Zheng; Xin-Ran Gao; Chen Gu; Yu-Ning Ru; Rui-Ping Xu; Yu-Hang Yang; De-Hua Wang
40563489,Conditioned Generative Modeling of Molecular Glues: A Realistic AI Approach for Synthesizable Drug-like Molecules.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by the pathological accumulation of amyloid beta-42 (Aβ42), contributing to synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. While extracellular amyloid plaques are well-studied, increasing evidence highlights intracellular Aβ42 as an early and toxic driver of disease progression. In this study, we present a novel, Generative AI-based drug design approach to promote targeted degradation of Aβ42 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), using E3 ligase-directed molecular glues. We systematically evaluated the ternary complex formation potential of Aβ42 with three E3 ligases (CRBN, VHL, and MDM2) through structure-based modeling, ADMET screening, and docking. We then developed a Ligase-Conditioned Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder (LC-JT-VAE) to generate ligase-specific small molecules, incorporating protein sequence embeddings and torsional angle-aware molecular graphs. Our results demonstrate that this generative model can produce chemically valid, novel, and target-specific molecular glues capable of facilitating Aβ42 degradation. This integrated approach offers a promising framework for designing UPS-targeted therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.",Biomolecules,2025,Naeyma N Islam; Thomas R Caulfield
40563471,Cytoskeletal Proteins and Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis: Focusing on the Interplay with Tau Pathology.,"The aggregation of Tau protein into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is associated with cognitive decline. Recent studies have revealed that neuronal cytoskeletal instability drives early AD pathogenesis. The physiological interaction between tau and the microtubule (MT) is crucial for maintaining axonal transport and stability. However, aberrant post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the MT binding domain-such as phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitination-trigger tau dissociation, causing microtubule collapse, transport deficits, and synaptic dysfunction. MT dysregulation also affects actin/cofilin-mediated dendritic spine destabilization and causes the hyperplasia of the glial intermediate filament, which exacerbates neuroinflammation and synaptic toxicity. This review systematically explores the functions of neuronal cytoskeletons, deciphers the molecular crosstalk between tau pathology and cytoskeletal remodeling, and proposes multi-target therapeutic strategies to restore cytoskeletal homeostasis, thereby providing novel perspectives for precision interventions in AD.",Biomolecules,2025,Gege Jiang; Guanfeng Xie; Xiaoyi Li; Jing Xiong
40563464,The Role and Pathogenesis of Tau Protein in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a predominant neurodegenerative disorder, is clinically characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration and behavioral deficits. An in-depth understanding of the pathogenesis and neuropathology of AD is essential for the development of effective treatments and early diagnosis techniques. The neuropathological signature of AD involves two hallmark lesions: intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates and extracellular senile plaques containing amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide depositions. Although Aβ-centric research has dominated AD investigations over the past three decades, pharmacological interventions targeting Aβ pathology have failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy. Tau, a microtubule-associated protein predominantly localized to neuronal axons, orchestrates microtubule stabilization and axonal transport through dynamic tubulin interactions under physiological conditions. In AD pathogenesis, however, tau undergoes pathogenic post-translational modifications (PTMs), encompassing hyperphosphorylation, lysine acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and glycosylation. These PTM-driven alterations induce microtubule network disintegration, mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic impairment, and neuroinflammatory cascades, ultimately culminating in irreversible neurodegeneration and progressive cognitive decline. This review synthesizes contemporary advances in tau PTM research and delineates their mechanistic contributions to AD pathogenesis, thereby establishing a framework for biomarker discovery, targeted therapeutic development, and precision medicine approaches in tauopathies. This review synthesizes contemporary advances in tau PTM research and delineates their mechanistic contributions to AD pathogenesis, thereby establishing a solid theoretical and experimental basis for the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, the discovery of therapeutic targets, and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",Biomolecules,2025,Xiaoyue Hong; Linshu Huang; Fang Lei; Tian Li; Yi Luo; Mengliu Zeng; Zhuo Wang
40563456,Are Cannabis-Based Medicines a Useful Treatment for Neuropathic Pain? A Systematic Review.,"Neuropathic pain is a chronic disorder that arises from damaged or malfunctioning nerves. Hypersensitivity to stimuli, also known as hyperalgesia, can cause a person to experience pain from non-painful stimuli, termed allodynia. Cannabis-based medicines (CBMs) may provide new treatment options to manage neuropathic pain. A review of the relevant studies was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of CBMs in treating neuropathic pain. Scientific literature was systematically searched from January 2003 to December 2024 using the Web of Science Core Collection, PubMed, and MEDLINE. A total of 22 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified that considered the use of 1',1'-dimethylheptyl-Δ<sup>8</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol-11-oic acid (CT-3), Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC), cannabidiol (CBD), combinations of Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC with CBD, and cannabidivarin for treatment of neuropathic pain. Significant reductions in pain were reported in 15 studies focused on the treatment of multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injuries, diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, HIV-associated sensory neuropathy, peripheral neuropathic pain, complex regional pain syndrome, chronic radicular neuropathic pain, and peripheral neuropathy of the lower extremities. These positive outcomes often adopted personalized and adjusted dosing strategies. By contrast, seven RCTs observed no significant pain relief compared to placebo, although some had minor improvements in secondary outcomes, such as mood and sleep. Collectively, CBM treatments may improve pain scores, but study limitations such as small sample sizes and study durations, high placebo response rates, and trial unblinding because of the psychoactive effects of cannabinoids all hinder data interpretation and the extrapolation to chronic pain conditions. Hence, future RCTs will need to have larger numbers and be more extended studies that explore optimal dosing and delivery methods and identify patient subgroups that are most likely to benefit. While CBMs show potential, their current use balances modest benefits against possible adverse effects and variable outcomes.",Biomolecules,2025,Nawaf Almuntashiri; Basma M El Sharazly; Wayne G Carter
40563446,"Non-Coding RNAs: lncRNA, piRNA, and snoRNA as Robust Plasma Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia worldwide. As current diagnostic approaches remain limited in sensitivity and accessibility, there is a critical need for novel, non-invasive biomarkers aiding early detection. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), have emerged as promising candidates due to their regulatory roles in gene expression and association with diseases. In this study, we systematically profiled ncRNA expression from RNA sequencing data of 48 AD and 22 control blood tissue samples, aiming to evaluate their utility as biomarkers for AD classification. Differential expression analysis revealed widespread dysregulation of lncRNAs and piRNAs, with over 5000 lncRNAs and nearly 1000 piRNAs significantly upregulated in AD. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified multiple ncRNA modules associated with the AD phenotype. Using supervised machine learning approaches, we evaluated the diagnostic potential of ncRNA expression profiles, including single-gene, multi-gene, and module-level models. Random Forest models trained on individual genes identified 121 ncRNAs with AUROC > 0.8. Feature importance analysis emphasized ncRNAs such as lnc-MYEF2-3, lnc-PRKACB2, and HBII-115 as major contributors to diagnostic accuracy. These findings support the potential of ncRNA signatures as reliable and non-invasive biomarkers for AD diagnosis.",Biomolecules,2025,Ruomin Xin; Elizabeth Kim; Wei Tse Li; Jessica Wang-Rodriguez; Weg M Ongkeko
40563439,Increased [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 Uptake in the Skeletal Muscle of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> Mice: A New Potential of Translocator Protein 18 kDa Imaging in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,"The skeletal muscle has been proposed to contribute to the progressive loss of motor neurons typical of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, this mechanism has not yet been clarified due to the lack of suitable imaging tools. Here, we aimed to verify whether PET imaging of the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) can detect a muscular abnormality in an experimental model of ALS. In vivo biodistribution and kinetics of [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 were analyzed in skeletal muscle and brain of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> transgenic mice and in wildtype (WT) littermates. Both cohorts were divided into three groups (n = 6 each) to be studied at 60, 90 and 120 days. After microPET imaging, animals were sacrificed to evaluate inflammatory infiltrates by hematoxylin/eosin staining and TSPO expression by immunohistochemistry and Western blot in both quadriceps and brain. [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 uptake was higher in the skeletal muscles of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> than in WT mice in the preclinical phase (60 and 90 days) and further increased up to the symptomatic late stage (120 days). Inflammatory cells were absent in the quadriceps of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice whose myocytes, instead, showed a progressive increase in TSPO expression with advancing age. By contrast, brain tracer uptake and TSPO expression were comparably low in both groups, regardless of age and genotype. Upregulation of TSPO expression is characteristic of skeletal muscle, but not the brain, in the experimental SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model of ALS. Tracers targeting this pathway have been mostly proposed for the evaluation of inflammatory processes within the central nervous system. Nevertheless, the ubiquitous nature of TSPO expression and its responsiveness to various signals may broaden the diagnostic potential of these tracers to include disease conditions beyond inflammation.",Biomolecules,2025,Cecilia Marini; Mattia Riondato; Edoardo Dighero; Alessia Democrito; Serena Losacco; Laura Emionite; Lucilla Nobbio; Irene Di Patrizi; Mattia Camera; Chiara Ghersi; Maddalena Ghelardoni; Francesco Lanfranchi; Francesca Vitale; Sonia Carta; Sabrina Chiesa; Carola Torazza; Marco Milanese; Matteo Bauckneht; Mehrnaz Hamedani; Federico Zaottini; Angelo Schenone; Carlo Martinoli; Federica Grillo; Gianmario Sambuceti
40563435,Serum Npas-4 and Nptx-2 Levels in Alzheimer's Disease: Potential Biomarkers of Synaptic Dysfunction in a Cross-Sectional Study.,"<b>Background:</b> Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal loss. Identifying reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis and disease monitoring remains a critical need. <b>Objective:</b> This study aimed to investigate the serum levels of NPAS-4 (Neuronal PAS Domain Protein 4) and NPTX-2 (Neuronal Pentraxin 2) in patients with Alzheimer's disease, exploring their potential roles in disease pathophysiology and their relationship with lipid parameters. <b>Methods:</b> This was a cross-sectional study that included 63 patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and 56 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Venous blood samples were collected from all participants. NPAS-4 and NPTX-2 levels were measured using the ELISA method, while lipid parameters were analyzed via spectrophotometric techniques. Cognitive assessment was performed using the Standardized Mini-Mental Test (SMMT). Comparative analyses between groups, correlation studies, logistic regression, and ROC analyses were conducted. <b>Results:</b> Serum NPAS-4 and NPTX-2 levels were significantly lower in Alzheimer's patients compared to healthy controls (<i>p</i> < 0.001 and <i>p</i> = 0.001, respectively). Additionally, total cholesterol and LDL levels were lower in the patient group. Logistic regression analysis identified NPAS-4 as an independent risk predictor for Alzheimer's disease (OR = 0.313, <i>p</i> < 0.001). ROC analyses demonstrated that both biomarkers had significant diagnostic discrimination power. However, no significant correlation was found between NPAS-4 and NPTX-2 levels and SMMT scores or lipid parameters. <b>Conclusions:</b> The decreased levels of NPAS-4 and NPTX-2 in Alzheimer's patients may reflect biochemical manifestations of impaired synaptic plasticity. These findings suggest that NPAS-4 and NPTX-2 may serve as potential early biomarkers in the diagnosis and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease.",Biomolecules,2025,Alev Lazoglu Ozkaya; Nilifer Gürbüzer; Tolga Mercantepe; Filiz Mercantepe
40563433,Biomarkers and Mental Disorders: A Relevance Analysis Using a Random Forest Algorithm.,"Depression and anxiety are mental health disorders that significantly impact global public health, affecting more than 280 million people with depression and 301 million with anxiety worldwide. These conditions impair individuals' ability to engage in economic and personal activities and can lead to severe outcomes, such as suicide. Current research suggests that inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), play crucial roles in the pathophysiology of these disorders, influencing neurotransmitters. Elevated cortisol levels, typically associated with anxiety, worsen these conditions through dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Additionally, vitamin D deficiency has been linked to reduced production of dopamine and norepinephrine, hormones involved in depressive symptoms. This study utilized the Random Forest machine learning algorithm along with cross-validation to assess the importance of various biomarkers, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF, cortisol, vitamin D, NT-proBNP, CK-MB, troponin, myoglobin, and C-reactive protein (CRP), in volunteers of both sexes diagnosed with mental disorders. A single sample from each of the 96 participants was analyzed, consisting of 50 women and 46 men. The results revealed sex-specific differences in biomarker relevance, with vitamin D, CRP, and D-dimer being the most predictive for depression in men, while IL-6, CRP, and vitamin D were significant in women. For anxiety, vitamin D and myoglobin were important biomarkers in men, while IL-8 and vitamin D were key in women. The methodological strategy adopted, based on the use of Random Forest and cross-validation assessment, not only confirmed the robustness of the model but also reliably identified the most important biomarkers for the outcomes studied.",Biomolecules,2025,Joice M A Rodolpho; Krissia F Godoy; Bruna D L Fragelli; Jaqueline Bianchi; Fernanda O Duarte; Luciana Camillo; Gustavo B Silva; Paulo H M Andrade; Juliana A Prado; Carlos Speglich; Fernanda F Anibal
40563428,CLSI Validation of Exchangeable Copper Determination in Serum by ICP-MS: A Focus on Alzheimer's Disease and Wilson Disease.,"Copper dyshomeostasis has been implicated in a subset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, characterized by elevated non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (non-Cp Cu). However, traditional methods for estimating non-Cp Cu are indirect and analytically imprecise. This study introduces and validates a direct assay for exchangeable copper (ExcCu) by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), compliant with Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. We performed analytical validation of the ExcCu assay following CLSI protocols (EP5, EP6, EP7, EP9, EP15, and EP28). ExcCu and other copper-related biomarkers were quantified in serum samples from 154 healthy controls, 82 AD patients, and 10 patients with Wilson disease (WD). Diagnostic performance was evaluated via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and inter-method agreement was assessed using Bland-Altman plots. The ExcCu assay demonstrated excellent linearity, precision (CV < 6%), and inter-laboratory reproducibility. Among AD patients, ExcCu levels were significantly elevated compared to controls (<i>p</i> < 0.001). ExcCu distinguished AD from controls with an AUC of 0.80 and a specificity of 95%. Compared to non-Cp Cu, ExcCu yielded no negative values and showed reduced bias. The relative exchangeable copper (REC) index was more effective in differentiating AD from WD (AUC = 0.88). The validated ExcCu assay overcomes the limitations of the traditional non-Cp Cu calculation, offering a reliable biomarker for copper-related AD subtypes. Its high specificity supports its use in patient stratification, potentially contributing to personalized approaches in AD diagnosis and therapy.",Biomolecules,2025,Rosanna Squitti; Amit Pal; Irena D Ivanova; Massimo Marianetti; Mauro Rongioletti
40563425,Consideration of Anesthesia Techniques for Deep Brain Stimulation Implantation in the Treatment of Drug-Resistant Epilepsy: A Narrative Review.,"Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures, affecting millions worldwide. While anti-seizure medications serve as first-line treatment, approximately one-third of patients develop drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), necessitating alternative interventions. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a promising therapy for DRE, particularly for patients who are ineligible for resective surgery. DBS involves stereotactic implantation of electrodes into target brain regions, such as the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT), centromedian nucleus (CMT), and hippocampus (HC), to modulate aberrant neural activity and to reduce seizure frequency. Anesthesia plays a critical role in DBS implantation, influencing both patient safety and procedural success. The choice of anesthetic technique must balance patient comfort with the preservation of neurophysiological signals used for intraoperative electrode localization. A well-chosen anesthetic strategy can enhance the efficacy of electrode placement by minimizing patient movement and preserving critical neurophysiological signals for real-time monitoring. This precise targeting enhances safety via a reduction in perioperative risks and an improvement in long-term seizure control. Anesthetic considerations in epilepsy patients differ from those in movement disorders due to variations in their nuclei targets during DBS. Despite the increasing use of DBS for epilepsy following its FDA approval in 2018, research on anesthetic effects specific to this population remains limited. This narrative review, therefore, examines anesthetic approaches, pharmacological implications, potential complications, and evolving methods for DBS implantation in epilepsy patients, highlighting new insights and unique considerations in this population. Understanding these factors is essential for optimizing surgical outcomes and improving the safety and efficacy of DBS in epilepsy treatment.",Biomolecules,2025,Alan D Kaye; Benjamin Esneault; Shreya Deshpande; Joseph Wentling; Shahab Ahmadzadeh; Pooja Potharaju; Sahar Shekoohi
40563410,Targeting Glioblastoma Stem Cells: A40s Aptamer-NIR-Dye Conjugate for Glioblastoma Visualization and Treatment.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and challenging brain cancer, in terms of diagnosis and therapy. The highly infiltrative glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) are difficult to visualize and surgically remove with the current diagnostic tools, which often lead to misdiagnosis and false-positive results. In this study, we focused on a groundbreaking tool for specifically visualizing and removing GSCs. We exploited the specific binding of A40s aptamer to EphA2 for the selective delivery of Near-Infrared Dyes (NIR-Dyes), like IR700DX and ICG, both in vitro and in vivo. The A40s aptamer, engineered through the NIR-Dye conjugation, did not affect aptamer binding ability; indeed, A40s-NIR-Dye conjugates bound GLI261 stem-like cells and patient-derived GSCs in vitro; moreover, they induced cell death upon photodynamic therapy treatment (PDT). Additionally, when systemically administrated, the A40s-NIR-Dye conjugates allowed GSC visualization and accumulated in tumor mass. This allows GSCs detection and treatment. Our findings demonstrate the potential use of A40s aptamer as a targeted therapeutic approach and imaging tool in vivo for GSCs, paving the way for improved, more effective, and less invasive GBM management.",Biomolecules,2025,Alessandra Affinito; Francesco Ingenito; Sara Verde; Emanuele Musella; Birlipta Pattanayak; Danilo Fiore; Cristina Quintavalle; Aurelia Fraticelli; Martina Mascolo; Gianluca Petrillo; Claudia Pignataro; Giada De Luca; Laura Mezzanotte; Gerolama Condorelli
40563398,"Oxidative DNA Damage and Repair Dynamics in Multiple Sclerosis: Insights from Comet Assay Kinetics, Base Excision Repair Gene Expression, and Genotype Analysis.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory disease where oxidative stress and DNA damage may influence disease progression. We investigated whether defects in base excision repair (BER) pathways contribute to MS by combining functional DNA repair assays, gene expression profiling, and genotype analysis. We collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 70 MS patients and 61 healthy controls. These cells were subjected to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBH)-induced oxidative stress, and comet assay kinetics were measured over a period of 60 min. Additionally, we quantified the mRNA expression of nine key BER genes and genotyped selected polymorphisms related to DNA repair capacity. Samples from MS patients exhibited significantly higher levels of TBH-induced DNA lesions and displayed a distinct repair trajectory over time, as indicated by area-under-the-curve (AUC) analyses (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The transcripts of <i>MBD4</i> and <i>NTHL1</i> were notably reduced in MS patients compared to those in the controls (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). A logistic regression analysis revealed an association between the specific BER-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs3087404, rs4135054, and rs1052133 and ineffective DNA repair. Subset analyses of B cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells further supported the presence of altered repair kinetics in MS, even though some subsets exhibited similar baseline lesion levels. Our findings suggest that impaired oxidative DNA repair is present in MS, likely driven by functional deficits in repair kinetics and alterations in the expression of BER genes and polymorphisms. This integrated approach highlights DNA repair pathways as potential therapeutic or prognostic targets in MS.",Biomolecules,2025,Beata Filipek; Anna Macieja; Aleksandra Binda; Rafal Szelenberger; Leslaw Gorniak; Elzbieta Miller; Mariola Swiderek-Matysiak; Mariusz Stasiolek; Ireneusz Majsterek; Tomasz Poplawski
40563362,Pathways to the Brain: Impact of Fine Particulate Matter Components on the Central Nervous System.,"Fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 µm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) has been extensively studied due to its adverse health effects. Most research has focused on its impact on the respiratory system; however, increasing attention is being directed toward its effects on the brain. Associations between air pollution and neurological disorders-such as Alzheimer's disease, cerebral infarction, and autism spectrum disorder-have been reported, with mechanism-based studies in animal models providing further insights. PM<sub>2.5</sub> comprises a complex mixture of thousands of chemical constituents. To elucidate its neurotoxicity mechanisms, it is essential to investigate both its transport pathways to the brain and the specific actions of its individual components. This review highlights key PM<sub>2.5</sub> components-water-soluble ions, metals, carbonaceous particles, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, quinones, plastics, and bioaerosols-and outlines their potential routes of entry into the central nervous system, along with their associated mechanisms of action. By integrating these findings, this review contributes to a deeper understanding of the neurological effects mediated by PM<sub>2.5</sub>, which represent one of the most critical aspects of its health impact.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Yasuhiro Ishihara; Miki Tanaka; Naoyuki Nezu; Nami Ishihara; Ami Oguro; Christoph F A Vogel
40563355,"Scutellarin Alleviates Cuprizone-Induced Demyelination by Improving Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Reducing Lipid Oxidation and Inhibiting the p38 MAPK Pathway.","The occurrence of demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) causes neurodegenerative lesions. The occurrence and development of demyelination involve multiple pathological mechanisms, including the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by mitochondrial dysfunction in microglia and subsequent neuroinflammation. Scutellarin is a natural flavonoid drug with significant neuroprotective effects, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties, and is widely used in the treatment of neurological diseases. However, the protective effects and mechanisms of scutellarin on demyelination have not yet been elucidated. This study aims to investigate the neuroprotective effects of scutellarin on demyelination and its underlying molecular mechanisms. Our results showed that treatment with scutellarin significantly alleviated Cuprizone-induced myelin damage, neuronal apoptosis, and neurological deficits in mice. In in vitro experiments, scutellarin significantly reduced Cuprizone-copper-induced pro-inflammatory microglia formation and inhibited the secretion of TNF-α, thereby reducing myelin cell damage. Mechanism studies revealed that scutellarin inhibited the secretion of TNF-α by microglia and alleviated myelin cell damage by reducing the excessive production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (Mito-ROS), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and malondialdehyde (MDA) induced by Cuprizone-copper in microglia. Finally, scutellarin improved mitochondrial dysfunction in microglia and significantly alleviated myelin cell damage by inhibiting the expression of p38MAPK. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that scutellarin exerts significant neuroprotective effects on Cuprizone-induced mice by improving mitochondrial dysfunction in microglia, thereby reducing inflammatory responses. This effect is closely associated with the inhibition of the p38MAPK pathway.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Qiting Zhao; Yantuanjin Ma; Shufen Wang
40563347,Astaxanthin: A Compound in the Prevention of Chronic Diseases and as a Potential Adjuvant Treatment Agent.,"Astaxanthin (AST) is a fat-soluble carotenoid antioxidant. AST exhibits multiple protective mechanisms, including its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-apoptotic, nervous system-protective, anti-tumor, and anti-fibrotic effects. These effects make it a promising compound for the prevention of chronic diseases. AST can protect the nervous system against neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. It also protects the liver and helps reduce the risk of chronic kidney disease. Additionally, it improves cardiovascular health and has anti-diabetic properties. This review aims to provide an updated overview covering the protective effects of AST against various chronic diseases, including its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects. We also discuss the strategies used for improving astaxanthin bioavailability and its potential as an adjuvant therapeutic agent.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Xiao Zhu; Xi Chen; Matthew Wang; Honghua Hu
40563328,Oxidative Stress: Pathological Driver in Chronic Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Oxidative stress has become a common impetus of various diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases. This review introduces the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROSs) in the nervous system, the cellular oxidative damage, and the high sensitivity of the brain to ROSs. The literature review focuses on the roles of oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Oxidative stress occurs when excessively produced free radicals are beyond the capability of endogenous antioxidants to scavenge, leading to the oxidation of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, stimulating neuroinflammatory responses, causing neuronal dysfunction, senescence, and death. The dysfunctional mitochondria and aberrant activities of metabolic enzymes are the major source of ROSs. The high vulnerability of the nervous system to ROSs underlies the critical roles of oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases. Gene mutations and other risk factors promote the generation of ROSs, which have been considered a crucial force causing the main pathological features of AD, PD, HD, and ALS. As a result, antioxidants hold therapeutic potential in these neurodegenerative diseases. The elucidation of the pathogenic mechanisms of oxidative stress will facilitate the development of antioxidants for the treatment of these diseases.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Zhao Zhong Chong; Nizar Souayah
40563324,Dynamic Transcriptomic and Cellular Remodeling Underlie Cuprizone-Induced Demyelination and Endogenous Repair in the CNS.,"Demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) disrupts neuronal communication and promotes neurodegeneration. Despite the widespread use of cuprizone-induced demyelination models to study myelin injury and repair, the mechanisms underlying oligodendrocyte apoptosis and regeneration are poorly understood. This study investigated the dynamic cellular and molecular changes that occur during demyelination and remyelination, with a focus on glial cell responses, blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and neuroimmune interactions. <i>C57BL/6J</i> mice exposed to cuprizone exhibited weight loss, sensorimotor deficits, and cognitive decline, which were reversed during remyelination. Histological and immunofluorescence analyses revealed reduced myelin protein levels, including myelin basic protein (MBP) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), and decreased oligodendrocyte populations during demyelination, with recovery during repair. The BBB permeability increases during demyelination, is associated with the decreased expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Occludin), and normalizes during remyelination. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed dynamic shifts in glial cell populations and upregulated Psap-Gpr37l1 signaling. Neuroimmune activation and oxidative stress peak during demyelination, characterized by elevated ROS, MDA, and immune cell infiltration, followed by recovery. Transcriptomic profiling revealed key inflammatory pathways (JAK-STAT, NF-κB) and hub genes associated with demyelination and repair. These findings provide insights into myelin repair mechanisms and highlight potential therapeutic targets for treating demyelinating diseases.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Yantuanjin Ma; Tianyi Liu; Zhipeng Li; Wei Wei; Qiting Zhao; Shufen Wang
40563239,"Big Data, Small Bias: Harmonizing Diffusion MRI-Based Structural Connectomes to Mitigate Site-Related Bias in Data Integration.","Diffusion MRI-based structural connectomes are increasingly used to investigate brain connectivity changes associated with various disorders. However, small sample sizes in individual studies, along with highly heterogeneous disorder-related manifestations, underscore the need to pool datasets across multiple studies to be able to identify coherent and generalizable connectivity patterns linked to these disorders. Yet, combining datasets introduces site-related differences due to variations in scanner hardware or acquisition protocols. These differences highlight the necessity for statistical data harmonization to mitigate site-related effects on structural connectomes while preserving the biological information associated with participant demographics and the disorders. While several paradigms exist for harmonizing normally distributed neuroimaging measures, this paper represents the first effort to establish a harmonization framework specifically tailored for the structural connectome. We conduct a thorough investigation of various statistical harmonization methods, adapting them to accommodate the unique distributional characteristics and graph-based properties of structural connectomes. Through rigorous evaluation, we show that our MATCH algorithm, based on the gamma-distributed model, consistently outperforms existing approaches in modeling structural connectomes, enabling the effective removal of site-related biases in both edge-based and downstream graph analyses while preserving biological variability. Two real-world applications further highlight the utility of our harmonization framework in addressing challenges in multi-site structural connectome analysis. Specifically, harmonization with MATCH enhances the generalizability of connectome-based machine learning predictors to new datasets and increases statistical power for detecting group-level differences. Our work provides essential guidelines for harmonizing multi-site structural connectomes, paving the way for more robust discoveries through collaborative research in the era of team science and big data.",Human brain mapping,2025,Rui Sherry Shen; Drew Parker; Andrew An Chen; Benjamin E Yerys; Birkan Tunç; Timothy P L Roberts; Russell T Shinohara; Ragini Verma
40563229,Unraveling the Bidirectional Associations of Psychotic-Like Experiences With Depressive Symptoms and Suicidal Ideation Among Adolescents.,"Previous literature suggests that adolescent psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) are associated with depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. This study aimed to explore these prospective relationships between PLEs, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation among adolescents. A large-scale web-based survey was conducted using repeated measures at three time points: from 21 April to 12 May 2021 (T1), from 17 to 26 December 2021 (T2), and from 17 May to 6 June 2022 (T3). A total of 17,722 adolescents were assessed at both T1 and T2, and 15,694 adolescents also provided complete responses at both T1 and T3. Self-reported scales were used to assess PLEs and depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation was assessed. PLEs at baseline were significantly associated with increased odds of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation at both follow-up intervals after adjusting for covariates (all p < 0.001). Moreover, baseline depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation were significantly associated with increased likelihoods of subsequent PLEs (all p < 0.001). This study underscores bidirectional prospective associations between PLEs, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation among adolescents, and its findings underscore the critical educational and clinical importance of screening for PLEs while treating depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation.",Suicide & life-threatening behavior,2025,Dongfang Wang; Brendan Ross; Meng Sun; Huolian Li; Xiangting Zhang; Xuan Wang; Yang Qiu; Zijuan Ma; Fang Fan

40563187,Improving Hospital Delirium Screening and Documentation.,"Appropriate delirium screening and documentation are important for hospitalized patients to ensure positive patient outcomes and patient safety. A preliminary process review at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, identified low adherence (25.9%) to delirium screening and documentation requirements. The aim of this quality improvement (QI) project was to identify gaps in delirium screening and documentation, determine possible causes of these gaps, and design interventions to help improve the completion of required delirium screening and documentation over one year without adversely affecting other required nursing assessments. The target of the project was an improvement in the rate of screening documentation of at least 50%. After Mayo Clinic's preliminary process review identified low adherence to delirium screening and documentation requirements, a multidisciplinary workgroup was convened, and a QI project following Six Sigma methods was implemented between May 2022 and April 2023 (the study period). Review of electronic health records (EHRs) and an informal survey of nurses and personal care assistants (enhanced by interviews and shadowing) facilitated fishbone analysis and creation of an impact-effort grid showing the relative difficulty and impact of possible interventions. An automated data-monitoring dashboard for the EHR was developed, and the Brief Confusion Assessment Method (bCAM) documentation in the EHR was restructured and introduced (first intervention). Nurse educational modules were amended to be consistent across practice areas, and a best-practice advisory (BPA) was created to bridge communication between nurses (RNs) and clinicians (physicians, NPs, and physician assistants). Delirium screening was added to the reminder list of required shift documentation in February 2023 (second intervention). A counterbalance measure, pressure injury risk, was chosen as a proxy for other required nursing assessments to show any unintentional downturn in other staff performance. After the bCAM redesign was introduced on June 1, 2022, delirium screening documentation decreased to 17.4% by June 30, but increased to 19.4% by July 31. After the RN educational module was implemented on July 1, delirium screening documentation increased further, to 20.7% by August, but dipped again to 13.7% by January 2023. After delirium screening was included in the required shift documentation reminder list in February 2023, delirium screening documentation significantly increased, from the baseline rate of 25.9% in May 2022 to 42.8% in March 2023 (P < 0.001) and to 47.7% in April 2023 (P < 0.001). The BPA was also associated with an increase in clinician capture of delirium diagnoses in the EHR of 47%. The rates of pressure injury risk assessment remained the same throughout the study period with only minor fluctuations. In this QI project, the addition of delirium screening to shift documentation was associated with a greater than 50% increase in screening documentation, suggesting improved nurse-clinician communication. Introduction of the BPA was also associated with increased clinician capture of delirium diagnoses in the EHR. Implementing these intervention changes may improve patient outcomes and safety.",The American journal of nursing,2025,Stephanie Chambers; Renu Bhargavi Boyapati; Rachel Gagliasso; Linda Griebenow; Shant Ayanian; Christopher Kohler; Sandeep Pagali
40563184,Assessing and Promoting Sleep Health: A Brief Guide for Nurses.,"Despite the importance of sleep for maintaining health and well-being, there is a notable lack of educational curricula and training on sleep health in nursing schools and clinical settings. To ensure holistic care, it is essential for nurses to be well-prepared to assess and address sleep-related issues.

40563139,The Efficacy and Safety of Brain Radiotherapy Combined With Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) for Small-Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) Patients With Brain Metastases (BMs).,"This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of brain radiotherapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) retrospectively in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients with brain metastases (BMs). A retrospective analysis was conducted on 42 SCLC patients with BMs, who received brain radiotherapy combined with ICIs at our Hospital from 2020 to 2024. They received chemotherapy plus ICIs regimens and brain radiotherapy, and received concurrent/sequential thoracic radiotherapy. This study investigated the forms of WBRT vs. WBRT+ simultaneous integrated boost (SIB, different doses of radiation being delivered simultaneously to different parts of the tumor) combined with ICIs on overall survival (OS), intracranial local control (iLC), and radiotherapy adverse reactions (side effection). The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival rate analysis. The log-rank test was used to compare the survival curves between different groups, and the chi-square (χ<sup>2</sup>) test was used to compare categorical data. In all the patients, the median follow-up time was 19.2 (range: 9.79-36.8) months. The 2-year OS rate and iLC rate were 42.3% and 68.8%, respectively. A total of 26 patients died of disease progression; 2 patients developed radiation-induced brain necrosis. The results showed that there was no significant difference in radiation-induced brain necrosis between the two groups. The WBRT patients suffered high rates of headache, dizziness, nausea, and radiodermatitis. The 2-year OS and iLC were brilliant. When brain radiotherapy combined with ICIs, even WBRT or WBRT + SIB had well OS and iLC with tolerable side reactions. Its indications needed to be considered from multiple perspectives. Further evaluation of brain radiotherapy combined with ICIs in SCLC BMs is required. Further prospective studies should be conducted to verify the conclusions.",Thoracic cancer,2025,Jie Xu; Yanling Yang; Tingting Chen; Dongmin Liu; Yajing Yuan; Liming Xu
40563122,Kv1.1 channel dysfunction in parvalbumin-positive interneurons contributes to anxiety-like behaviors in young adult presenilin 1/2 conditional double knockout mice.,"Anxiety occurs in the early stage of cognitive disorders, which can exacerbate cognitive impairment. However, the pathogenesis of this kind of anxiety remains unclear. In this study, we investigated anxiety-like behaviors in young adult presenilin 1/2 conditional double knockout (PS cDKO) mice, a model of progressive cognitive impairment, using behavioral tests and electrophysiological recordings. Disrupted excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance was observed in pyramidal neurons (PNs) of the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) CA1 (vCA1) region of PS cDKO mice. Meanwhile, PV + interneurons showed hypoexcitability, associated with increased outward K<sup>+</sup> currents due to elevated Kv1.1 potassium channel levels. Importantly, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Kv1.1 restored PV + interneuron activity and reduced anxiety-like behaviors. These findings highlight a role of Kv1.1 in controlling PV + interneuron excitability, suggesting that targeting Kv1.1 in vCA1 PV + interneurons could mitigate anxiety in early-stage cognitive dysfunction.",Cell & bioscience,2025,Guang Yang; Yang Zhao; Chenyi Zhao; Jinglan Yan; Yucen Xia; Kun Li; Yongkang Wu; Xingyu Wang; Meng Zhang; Yongjun Chen; Ying Xu
40563113,Melatonin as a potential adjuvant to mitigate depakine‑induced testicular damage in rats through its biological features.,"Depakine (valproic acid) is an antiepileptic medication that is commonly used as a first-line treatment for a variety of seizures in both adults and children. However, it can result in testicular toxicity by increasing oxidative stress inflammation. Melatonin (MLT) has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic potential. Therefore, the present study investigated the impact of MLT on depakine-induced testicular damage in rats. Four groups of male Wistar rats were formed, each of 5 animals: Group 1 was the control group; Group 2 was the MLT-treated group, receiving 20 mg MLT/kg BW; Group 3 was the depakine group, receiving 45 mg/kg; and Group 4 was the MLT + depakine treatment group, which received MLT and depakine for 14 days. Drug treatments were by gavage and daily. Coadministration of MLT and depakine significantly (P < 0.001) improved the levels of testosterone and the expression of androgen receptors in the testes, explaining the improvement of sperm count, motility, and abnormalities. Similarly, spermatogenic cell depletion and shrinkage of seminiferous tubules were prevented by MLT + depakine treatment. Moreover, the testicles of rats given MLT + depakine had common histological architecture of seminiferous tubules, perimeter, and diameter, indicating melatonin's anti-reproductive disruption. The combined treatment with MLT and dapakine resulted in the normalization of hematological parameters, including erythrocyte, platelet, and leukocyte counts; hematocrit content; mean cellular volume; mean cellular hemoglobin; and mean cellular hemoglobin concentration to levels comparable to the control group. These effects were associated with the enhancement of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 and glutathione levels. Moreover, reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde formation were decreased in the testis compared to the depakine-treated rats, indicating improvement in the redox status in the testis. The improvement of redox balance caused a remarkable regression of apoptotic regulating proteins (Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3) in the testis and downregulated inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-6, ICAM-1, and MCP-1), indicating protection of spermatogenic cell viability. The combination treatment with MLT and depakine sustained male reproductive status, which can be attributable to the integrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties of MLT. These results may contribute to increase the clinical utility of depakine as a successful choice for neurological disorders.",BMC complementary medicine and therapies,2025,Maggie E Amer; Mohamed A Dardoor; Azza I Othman; Mohamed A El-Missiry
40563111,Copper supplementation mitigates Parkinson-like wild-type SOD1 pathology and nigrostriatal degeneration in a novel mouse model.,"Misfolded wild-type superoxide dismutase 1 (disSOD1) protein is implicated in the death of substantia nigra (SN) dopamine neurons in Parkinson disease. Regionally reduced copper availability, and subsequent reduced copper binding to SOD1, is a key factor driving the development of this pathology, suggesting brain copper supplementation may constitute an effective means of preventing its formation. We evaluated whether the blood-brain-barrier-permeable copper delivery drug, CuATSM, attenuated the misfolding and deposition of wild-type disSOD1 and associated neuron death in a novel mouse model that expresses this pathology. These factors were profiled using proteomic and elemental mass spectrometry, together with biochemical and histological workflows. We demonstrated copper supplementation corrects altered post-translational modifications on soluble SOD1 and improves the enzymatic activity of the protein in the brains of these animals. These changes were associated with a significant reduction in disSOD1 pathology and preservation of dopamine neurons in the SN, which were highly correlated with tissue copper levels. Our data position wild-type disSOD1 pathology as a novel drug target for Parkinson disease and suggest that brain copper supplementation may constitute an effective means of slowing SN dopamine neuron death in this disorder.",Acta neuropathologica communications,2025,Benjamin D Rowlands; Benjamin G Trist; Connor Karozis; Greta Schaffer; David Mor; Richard Harwood; Sarah A Rosolen; Veronica Cottam; Freyja Persson-Carboni; Miriam Richardson; Anne A Li; Michael P Gotsbacher; Amr H Abdeen; Rachel Codd; Kay L Double
40563109,Primary care physician characteristics associated with becoming opioid agonist treatment prescribers in British Columbia: a retrospective case-control study.,"Opioid agonist treatment (OAT) is the gold standard of care for patients living with opioid use disorder. Since 2016, efforts to expand OAT access have focused on primary care physicians. This study aimed to understand how OAT-prescribing-naïve primary care physicians who began prescribing OAT differed from their peers who did not. We used administrative health data to identify all patients eligible for OAT initiation between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2019. We matched primary care visits that resulted in an OAT dispensation with visits that did not. We conducted logistic regression with generalized estimating equations to identify physician demographics and practice characteristics associated with becoming an OAT prescriber. Of the 4253 primary care physicians who were OAT-prescribing-naïve before 2016, 2183 (51.3%) began prescribing OAT. Physicians who practiced in rural settings (aOR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.32, 2.40) or saw fewer than 16 patients a day (aOR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.21, 1.75) were more likely to become OAT prescribers. The likelihood of becoming an OAT prescriber declined with the proportion of visits delivered out of office (aOR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.26) and years since graduation (e.g., physicians who graduated between 2000-2009 were 20% less likely to initiate (aOR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.99) compared with peers who graduated since 2010). Physicians who saw fewer patients and worked across fewer settings were more likely to become OAT prescribers. However, physicians in rural settings are stepping in to address unmet demand despite resource and time constraints. Understanding the differences between physicians who become OAT prescribers and peers who do not is critical to effectively target interventions to improve OAT access in the future.",Harm reduction journal,2025,Dimitra Panagiotoglou; Sandra Peterson; M Ruth Lavergne; Tara Gomes; Rashmi Chadha; Cheyenne Johnson; Rita McCracken
40563086,"IFP35, a novel DAMP, aggravates neuroinflammation following acute ischemic stroke via TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling.","Acute ischemic stroke is a disastrous disease characterized by damaging blood flow in the brain, leading to acute brain injury. Acute brain ischemia elicits severe inflammation, thus in turn, aggravates neural injury. Interferon-Induced Protein 35 (IFP35), is a 35 kDa protein, a novel type of DAMP that trigger inflammatory responses, exacerbating acute and chronic inflammatory disease. This study aimed to investigate the potential neuroinflammation role of IFP35 in acute ischemic stroke in a mouse model of MCAO. C57BL/6 male mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to establish an animal model of acute ischemic stroke. Leveraging serum from stroke patients, serum and brain tissue after MCAO mice, IFP35 was released. Immunofluorescence assay was used to investigated the cell sources of IFP35 expression after MCAO. The impact of IFP35 on neuroinflammation and neural injury was assessed by siRNA-mediated cerebral IFP35 knockdown. Behavioral tests, and brain tissues were harvested for histological analysis and biochemical assays. TUNEL assays were used to evaluate neuronal damage. TTC staining was performed to assess infarction volumes. Additionally, using western blotting and immunofluorescence assays, we further assessed the contribution of TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling in MCAO mice and BV2 cells. IFP35 was accumulated in peripheral blood of cerebral ischaemia patients, ischemia mice serum, as well as peri-infarct regions in focal cerebral ischemia mice. Although endothelial cells, microglia, and astrocytes are capable of expressing IFP35, cerebral neural cells seem to express and release more IFP35 compare to other cell types. Knockdown of IFP35 alleviated the production of neuroinflammatory cytokines, decreased neuronal death, and minimized infarct volumes, ultimately leading to improved neurological outcomes. Importantly, IFP35 triggered the activation of NF-κΒ and NLRP3 signaling, exacerbating neuroinflammation and brain injury by binding its receptor TLR4. This study revealed IFP35 as a novel DAMP released during cerebral ischemia that promotes neuroinflammation and injury, expanding the current understanding of inflammatory networks following stroke.",Journal of neuroinflammation,2025,Mengmeng Zhang; Bingnan Guo; Xiaowei Zhang; Dong Han; Lanxin Lv; Xiaoqing Yan; Chenglei Su; Dafei Chai; Ningjun Zhao; Xianliang Yan; Shuqun Hu
40563055,Poor neurological outcome after treatment with photobiomodulation in a patient recovering from sequelae of vertebral artery dissection.,"PhotBioModulation Therapy (PBMT) is regarded as a safe therapy for various disorders. We report a patient with a vertebral artery dissection treated with PBMT resulting in a poor neurological outcome. A 69-year-old patient with a PICA infarction after a vertebral artery dissection was treated with PhotoBioModulation Therapy using a helmet. This therapy induces strong vasodilatation in the area of application. Shortly after this treatment, she fell asleep and did not wake up the next morning. Clinically she was comatose and an MRI showed bithalamic and mesencephalic infarction as a result of thrombosis of the basilar artery tip. A causative relation between the PhotoBioModulation Therapy and the poor outcome is likely based on the time course, the immediate complaints after treatment, and the usually excellent prognosis after vertebral artery dissection. We advise the manufacturers of PBMT devices to add (recent) stroke to the list of contraindications.",Acta neurologica Belgica,2025,W J van Rooij; M Sluzewski
40563051,Beyond the Heart: Exploring Extracardiac Manifestations in Cardiac Amyloidosis for Early Diagnosis.,"This review examines extracardiac manifestations of cardiac amyloidosis and their potential role in early diagnosis and management. Multisystem involvement, including musculoskeletal, peripheral nervous system, and other extracardiac findings are highlighted to serve as red flags for earlier detection. Early screening for high-risk individuals over 50 with CTS or spinal stenosis could enable earlier intervention. Peripheral neuropathy and CTS often precede cardiac involvement by 5-10 years, while spinal stenosis can precede it by 5-15 years. Other indicators include biceps tendon rupture, trigger finger, and gastrointestinal issues. MRI shows promise in detecting amyloid-related changes, especially wrist MRI. More studies are needed. Recognizing extracardiac findings may enable earlier diagnosis and intervention before significant cardiac dysfunction. Current workflows use extracardiac manifestations to detect cardiac amyloidosis after cardiac involvement. Integrating these insights earlier could identify amyloidosis years before cardiac issues, improving screening, patient outcomes, and guiding future therapies.",Current cardiology reports,2025,Marcus Saldanha; Lu Kun Chen; Joshua Solomon; Kristina Cunanan; Francois Tournoux; Rami Massie; Michael Chetrit
40563047,Development and Validation of Machine Learning Models for Predicting 7-Day Mortality in Critically Ill Patients with Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury: A Multicenter Retrospective Study.,"Traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI), a severe central nervous system injury, despite treatment advances, critically ill patients with TSCI face high short-term mortality. This study leverages machine learning to integrate standard intensive care unit (ICU) indicators, identifying 7-day high-mortality risk patients with TSCI to optimize treatment. Using critically ill patients with TSCI data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 2.2 database, this study employs the Boruta and LASSO regression algorithms to identify key features, developing a 7-day mortality risk prediction model in critically ill patients with TSCI using ten machine learning algorithms including Adaptive Boosting, Categorical Boosting, Gradient Boosting Machine, k-Nearest Neighbors, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Logistic Regression, Neural Network, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine, and Extreme Gradient Boosting. Model Performance is evaluated via receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curves, decision curve analysis, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1 score, whereas Shapley Additive Explanations ensure model interpretability. External validation with ICU data from the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University further assesses the model's generalizability. This study, collecting data from 261 and 45 critically ill patients with TSCI from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University's ICU, respectively, identified ten key features for model development, in which the RF model consistently outperformed others across raw and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique-balanced synthetic datasets in receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curves, decision curve analysis, and performance metrics. Shapley Additive Explanation analysis highlighted minimum body temperature, lowest systolic blood pressure, and Charlson Comorbidity Index as critical predictors in the RF model. External validation initially demonstrated the model's robustness and clinical applicability, leading to an online calculator that enables clinicians to estimate the 7-day survival probability of critically ill patients with TSCI. The RF model exhibits favorable performance in predicting 7-day mortality risk among critically ill patients with TSCI, indicating its potential utility in supporting clinical decision-making.",Neurocritical care,2025,Yixi Wang; Xinkai Luo; Jingjie Wang; Wenzhe Li; Jian Cui; Yuqian Li
40563018,Possible Mitigating Effect of Nobiletin on Rotenone-Induced Parkinsonism in Male Albino Rat Model: Targeting Bmal1/Nrf2 Mediated Ferroptosis and Restoring Mitochondrial Mitophagy.,"Ferroptosis and circadian disruption might be implicated in Parkinson disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder due to degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. As such, the ability to preserve mitochondrial and therefore neuronal homeostasis is essential. In PD, Nobiletin (NOB) may have neuroprotective effects. Still, further clarification is needed about the processes behind these impacts. To evaluate the positive effect of NOB against rotenone induced PD in rats via the Bmal1/ NRF2 axis regulation. Four groups of thirty-two male Albino rats were randomly assigned: Control, NOB treated, rotenone treated, and combined Rotenone and NOB treated groups. The validation of the neuroprotective potential of NOB entailed a behavioral examination, RT-PCR and colorimetric evaluation of biochemical markers, as well as immunohistopathological study of brain tissues. The relative gene expression of Bmal1 increased with NOB therapy significantly reducing the circadian rhythm disruption. Furthermore, as shown by the elevated Nrf2-DNA binding activity, increased levels of GPx4, and decreased levels of GSH with comparable low levels of MDA and Fe<sup>+2</sup> in the brain tissue, NOB ameliorated oxidative stress and ferroptosis. NOB stimulated both mitophagy and autophagy through the activation of Bmal1/Nrf2 pathway as characterized by upregulated expression of PINK-1 & Parkin genes and enhanced beclin-1 and LC3-II immunoreaction. This study showed that NOB ameliorated rotenone-induced PD by modulating dysregulated behavioral & cognitive dysfunction, attenuating ferroptosis & redox imbalance, and promoting mitophagy & autophagy through modulation of disrupted circadian rhythm through Bmal1/Nrf2 pathway.",Neurochemical research,2025,Sarah Ragab Abd El-Khalik; Norhan Ahmed AbuoHashish; Elham Nasif; Heba M Arakeep; Noha El-Anwar; Doaa Mohammed Yousef; Nada Hashem Ayad
40563011,Microglia promote inflammatory cell death upon neuronal mitochondrial impairment during neurodegeneration.,"The failure to clear dysfunctional mitochondria, cell death and inflammation have been linked in neurodegenerative disease, but their relationship and role in these conditions is not fully understood. Loss of Vps13d prevents clearance of mitochondria, and mutations in human VPS13D have been associated with neurological movement disorders. To investigate the relationship between mitochondrial health, inflammation and neurodegeneration, we created a conditional Vps13d-knockout mouse. Loss of Vps13d in excitatory neurons resulted in behavioral changes and neurodegeneration. Vacuolar protein sorting 13D (VPS13D) deficiency also caused mitochondrial ultrastructural defects and dysfunction in neurons followed by gasdermin E processing, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor (STING) signaling, microglial activation and cell death. Gasdermin E localization with mitochondria in Vps13d-mutant neurons was required for elevated extracellular mitochondrial DNA that promoted activation of microglia. Depletion of microglia suppressed cell death and behavioral phenotypes but not mitochondrial changes in the neuron-specific Vps13d-knockout model, indicating that microglia promote cell death in this model of neurodegenerative disease.",Nature structural & molecular biology,2025,Guangyan Miao; Tina M Fortier; Haibo Liu; Dorothy P Schafer; Katherine A Fitzgerald; Junhao Mao; Eric H Baehrecke
40562986,The Relationship Between Adherence to the MIND Diet and Maternal Anxiety and Sleep Disorders.,"Maternal diet is essential for the mother's and infant's health. Our Study aimed to evaluate the relationship between breastfeeding mothers' psychological distress and the Mediterranean diet and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet. The data were collected in a cross-sectional survey conducted by the authors in 2021. Psychological parameters were assessed in 350 breastfeeding mothers using the Quality of Life (QL) Questionnaire, Depression Scale, Anxiety Questionnaire, and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). A Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) assessed adherence to the MIND diet. Mothers in the highest tertile of the MIND diet had significantly lower maternal sleep disturbance scores (3.71 ± 3.61 vs. 5.28 ± 3.89; P < 0.001), lower anxiety scores (30.86 ± 7.49 vs. 32.89 ± 7.90; P-value = 0.01) and better maternal mental health (21.58 ± 3.68 vs. 20.76 ± 3.15) compared to those in the lowest tertile. After controlling for potential confounders, adherence to the MIND pattern was associated with less maternal sleep disturbance (β = 0.89; 95%CI: 0.82-0.96). for practice. Adherence to the MIND diet is potentially associated with less sleep disturbance in breastfeeding mothers.",Maternal and child health journal,2025,Afsane Bahrami; Zahra Zamaninasab; Zahra Khorasanchi; Asghar Zarban; Amir Hassan Asadian; Gordon A Ferns; Samira Karbasi
40562982,Significance of Behavioural Problems on Family Impact in Angelman Syndrome: A Prospective Cross-Sectional Study.,"Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurogenetic disorder characterized by severe developmental delay, absence of expressive language, movement disorders, epilepsy, sleep problems and a range of behavioural abnormalities. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of behavioural problems of AS patients on the parental perception of quality of life. The German version of the Abberant Behaviour Checklist (ABC) was used to record the behavioural problems of the children and adolescents. The outcome variable parental impact was measured using the Familiy Impact module of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQl Familiy impact). We used regression analyses to analyse the influence of behavioural problems on the parental impact as measured by. Additional data as genotype and epilepsy were further collected. The total cohort comprised 78 children and adolescents wit AS. Stereotypical behaviour ( <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <msup><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow> <mn>2</mn></msup> </math> .21) was the strongest predictor for increased parental impact followed by hyperactivity/noncompliance ( <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <msup><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow> <mn>2</mn></msup> </math> .14), irritability ( <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <msup><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow> <mn>2</mn></msup> </math> .11) and aberrant behaviour ( <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <msup><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow> <mn>2</mn></msup> </math> .11). Social withdrawal only affected the variables social functioning and family relationships. Inappropriate speech and genotype were not significant predictors. The presence of epilepsy affected family relationship but no other variables of parental functioning. Parents of AS patients with behavioural abnormalities might exhibit impaired quality of life scores. For the patients, behavioural training and drug therapy approaches should be considered.

In this article we present non-clinical studies evaluating the pharmacology of nomlabofusp, including in a murine striated muscle tissue frataxin knockout model of Friedreich's ataxia. We demonstrate that subcutaneous administration of nomlabofusp distributes in a dose-dependent manner to several organs including the dorsal root ganglion, heart, and skeletal muscle, which are known to be predominantly affected in Friedreich's ataxia, as well as to other tissues, including skin. Plasma nomlabofusp concentrations correlated with levels of human frataxin delivered by nomlabofusp into tissues, and the increases in frataxin were correlated amongst tissues, especially with skin. In the knockout mice, we show that the pharmacokinetics and processing of nomlabofusp were comparable with wild type animals and that treatment with nomlabofusp halts the progression of cardiac dysfunction and significantly increased survival. Together, the findings from these non-clinical studies demonstrate that nomlabofusp exposure increases human frataxin in Friedreich's ataxia-relevant tissues and provide evidence of pharmacologic effects.",The AAPS journal,2025,Flavia De Toni; Vanessa Ragaglia; Devin Schecter; Angela S Miller; Eric Gonzalez; Erik J Wagner; Xin Xu; R Mark Payne; Jean-Nicholas Mess; Matthew G Baile; Adrienne Clements-Egan; Gopi Shankar
40562949,"Positive effects of HIIT and vitamin E on cognitive function, angiogenesis and NRF2 antioxidant pathway in male rats with Alzheimer's disease.","Interactive effects of exercise and antioxidant supplements are still not well known. So, The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of high intensity interval training (HIIT) and vitamin E (VE) on the PI3K/NRF2 pathway in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease rats (AD). In this expremantal study, fifty aged AD rats with 10 mg/kg trimethyltin (TMT), were divided into groups 1) TMT, 2) VE solvent (Sham), 3) VE (30 mg/kg), 4) HIIT (90-95% of the maximum running speed) and 5) HIIT+VE. Ten healthy rats were included in the healthy control group to investigate the effect of TMT on research variables. Results Showed that, HIIT, VE and HIIT+VE decreased amyloid beta (P≤0.05), HIIT and HIIT+VE decreased NF-kB (P≤0.05) as well as HIIT, VE and HIIT+VE increased SOD and decreased MDA. HIIT simultaneously with VE increased PI3K, NRF2, and Cat. HIIT, VE and the interaction of HIIT and VE decreased the expression of miR-125b and increased expression of miR-132 (P≤0.05); The combination of HIIT and VE increased capillary density in areas 1 and 3, the percentage of healthy cells in C1 and C3 areas of the hippocampus (P≤0.05). The effects of HIIT and HIIT+VE on improving memory were better than VE (P≤0.05). It seems that HIIT and VE can synergistically increase the expression of antioxidant genes from the PI3K/NRF2 pathway by decreasing miR-125 and increasing miR-132. Probably, this happens by reducing some AD markers, increasing angiogenesis and cell protection as well as cognitive memory in AD situation.",Biogerontology,2025,Omidreza Salehi; Dariush Sheikholeslami-Vatani; Seyed Ali Hosseini
40562934,Engrafted nitrergic neurons derived from hPSCs improve gut dysmotility in mice.,"Gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders represent a major medical challenge, with few effective therapies available. These disorders often result from dysfunction of inhibitory nitric oxide (NO)-producing motor neurons in the enteric nervous system, which are essential for regulating gut motility. Loss or dysfunction of NO neurons is linked to severe conditions, including achalasia, gastroparesis, intestinal pseudo-obstruction and chronic constipation<sup>1,2</sup>. Here we introduce a platform based on human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) for therapeutic development targeting GI motility disorders. Using an unbiased screen, we identified drug candidates that modulate NO neuron activity and enhance motility in mouse colonic tissue ex vivo. We established a high-throughput strategy to define developmental programs driving the specification of NO neurons and found that inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) promotes their differentiation from precursors of the enteric nervous system. Transplantation of these neurons into NO-neuron-deficient mice led to robust engraftment and improved GI motility, offering a promising cell-based therapy for neurodegenerative GI disorders.

40562930,Mechanism of cytarabine-induced neurotoxicity.,"Postmitotic neurons have high levels of methylated cytosine and its oxidized intermediates such as 5-hydroxymethylcytosine<sup>1</sup>. However, the functional relevance of these epigenetic modifications of DNA are poorly understood. Here we show that some cytidine analogues, such as cytarabine, cause DNA double-strand breaks during TET-mediated active 5-methylcytosine demethylation by interrupting TDG-dependent base excision repair. These double-strand breaks are frequently converted into deletions and translocations by DNA ligase 4. In vivo, Purkinje and Golgi cells in the cerebellum are the only neuronal populations that exhibit high levels of DNA damage due to cytarabine. In Purkinje cells, TET targets highly expressed gene bodies marked by enhancer-associated histone modifications. Many of these genes control movement coordination, which explains the long-recognized cerebellar neurotoxicity of cytarabine<sup>2</sup>. We show that other cytidine analogues, such as gemcitabine, cause only single-strand breaks in neurons, which are repaired by DNA ligase 3 with minimal toxicity. Our findings uncover a mechanistic link between TET-mediated DNA demethylation, base excision repair and gene expression in neurons. The results also provide a rational explanation for the different neurotoxicity profiles of an important class of antineoplastic agents.",Nature,2025,Jia-Cheng Liu; Dongpeng Wang; Elsa Callen; Chuanyuan Chen; Santiago Noriega; Yafang Shang; David Schürmann; Yawei Song; Gokul N Ramadoss; Raj Chari; Nancy Wong; Yongge Zhao; Yuan He; Peter D Aplan; Michael E Ward; Nathaniel Heintz; Anjana Rao; Peter J McKinnon; Keith W Caldecott; Primo Schär; Fei-Long Meng; Ferenc Livak; Wei Wu; André Nussenzweig

40562893,Fine-mapping genomic loci refines bipolar disorder risk genes.,"Bipolar disorder is a heritable mental illness with complex etiology. While the largest published genome-wide association study identified 64 bipolar disorder risk loci, the causal SNPs and genes within these loci remain unknown. We applied a suite of statistical and functional fine-mapping methods to these loci and prioritized 17 likely causal SNPs for bipolar disorder. We mapped these SNPs to genes and investigated their likely functional consequences by integrating variant annotations, brain cell-type epigenomic annotations, brain quantitative trait loci and results from rare variant exome sequencing in bipolar disorder. Convergent lines of evidence supported the roles of genes involved in neurotransmission and neurodevelopment, including SCN2A, TRANK1, DCLK3, INSYN2B, SYNE1, THSD7A, CACNA1B, TUBBP5, FKBP2, RASGRP1, FURIN, FES, MED24 and THRA among others in bipolar disorder. These represent promising candidates for functional experiments to understand biological mechanisms and therapeutic potential. Additionally, we demonstrated that fine-mapping effect sizes can improve performance of bipolar disorder polygenic risk scores across diverse populations and present a high-throughput fine-mapping pipeline.",Nature neuroscience,2025,Maria Koromina; Ashvin Ravi; Georgia Panagiotaropoulou; Brian M Schilder; Jack Humphrey; Alice Braun; Tim Bidgeli; Chris Chatzinakos; Brandon J Coombes; Jaeyoung Kim; Xiaoxi Liu; Chikashi Terao; Kevin S O'Connell; Mark J Adams; Rolf Adolfsson; Martin Alda; Lars Alfredsson; Till F M Andlauer; Ole A Andreassen; Anastasia Antoniou; Bernhard T Baune; Susanne Bengesser; Joanna Biernacka; Michael Boehnke; Rosa Bosch; Murray J Cairns; Vaughan J Carr; Miquel Casas; Stanley Catts; Sven Cichon; Aiden Corvin; Nicholas Craddock; Konstantinos Dafnas; Nina Dalkner; Udo Dannlowski; Franziska Degenhardt; Arianna Di Florio; Dimitris Dikeos; Frederike Tabea Fellendorf; Panagiotis Ferentinos; Andreas J Forstner; Liz Forty; Mark Frye; Janice M Fullerton; Micha Gawlik; Ian R Gizer; Katherine Gordon-Smith; Melissa J Green; Maria Grigoroiu-Serbanescu; José Guzman-Parra; Tim Hahn; Frans Henskens; Jan Hillert; Assen V Jablensky; Lisa Jones; Ian Jones; Lina Jonsson; John R Kelsoe; Tilo Kircher; George Kirov; Sarah Kittel-Schneider; Manolis Kogevinas; Mikael Landén; Marion Leboyer; Melanie Lenger; Jolanta Lissowska; Christine Lochner; Carmel Loughland; Donald J MacIntyre; Nicholas G Martin; Eirini Maratou; Carol A Mathews; Fermin Mayoral; Susan L McElroy; Nathaniel W McGregor; Andrew McIntosh; Andrew McQuillin; Patricia Michie; Philip B Mitchell; Paraskevi Moutsatsou; Bryan Mowry; Bertram Müller-Myhsok; Richard M Myers; Igor Nenadić; Caroline M Nievergelt; Markus M Nöthen; John Nurnberger; Michael O 'Donovan; Claire O 'Donovan; Roel A Ophoff; Michael J Owen; Christos Pantelis; Carlos Pato; Michele T Pato; George P Patrinos; Joanna M Pawlak; Roy H Perlis; Evgenia Porichi; Danielle Posthuma; Josep Antoni Ramos-Quiroga; Andreas Reif; Eva Z Reininghaus; Marta Ribasés; Marcella Rietschel; Ulrich Schall; Peter R Schofield; Thomas G Schulze; Laura Scott; Rodney J Scott; Alessandro Serretti; Jordan W Smoller; Beata Świątkowska; Maria Soler Artigas; Dan J Stein; Fabian Streit; Claudio Toma; Paul Tooney; Marquis P Vawter; Eduard Vieta; John B Vincent; Irwin D Waldman; Cynthia Shannon Weickert; Thomas Weickert; Stephanie H Witt; Kyung Sue Hong; Masashi Ikeda; Nakao Iwata; Hong-Hee Won; Howard J Edenberg; Stephan Ripke; Towfique Raj; Jonathan R I Coleman; Niamh Mullins
40562860,Chronic liver injury scores are superior prognostic indicators of outcomes in severe alcohol-related burns.,"Acute and chronic alcohol abuse are common among burn patients and may be associated with chronic liver injury, a potential factor influencing outcomes. This study evaluates the predictive power of the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and non-invasive liver fibrosis scores and their applicability in burn patients. A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients admitted to a high-volume supraregional burn center in Northern Germany between 2007 and 2024. Patients were categorized based on their BAC at admission: low (< 100 mg/dL) vs. high (≥ 100 mg/dL). Data collected included demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes. Non-invasive liver fibrosis markers such as the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score, aspartate transaminase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) fibrosis score were applied to both groups. Among 121 large-surface burn patients (mean total body surface area: 16.4%), no significant differences were observed between BAC groups in demographics, comorbidities, or ICU admission rates. The serum ethanol concentration showed no significant predictive value for mortality (AUC = 0.515). In contrast, the FIB-4 score (AUC = 0.781) and APRI (AUC = 0.736) demonstrated strong prognostic accuracy. In multivariate analysis, the Abbreviated Burn Severity Index (OR = 2.42; p = 0.001), serum albumin (OR = 0.29; p = 0.016), and FIB-4 score (OR = 1.50; p = 0.033) emerged as independent predictors of mortality. Propensity score matching analysis confirmed that BAC was not associated with increased mortality after adjustment for burn depth and extent. Non-invasive liver fibrosis markers, such as FIB-4 score, provide valuable prognostic insights in burn patients, independent of acute alcohol intoxication and should be considered a routine screening tool for large surface burn patients. Incorporating chronic liver dysfunction into existing burn severity models may enhance risk stratification and outcome prediction.",Scientific reports,2025,Martynas Tamulevicius; Nadjib Dastagir; Khaled Dastagir; Peter M Vogt; Florian Bucher
40562846,SEL1L-HRD1-mediated ERAD in mammals.,"Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) is a critical quality control mechanism responsible for eliminating misfolded or unassembled proteins. It maintains endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis, ensures a proper folding environment and regulates substrate protein levels. Following its discovery in the late 1980s and early 1990s, research on ERAD in mammals-particularly that mediated by the conserved protein complex comprising suppressor/enhancer of Lin-12-like protein 1-like (SEL1L) and HMG-CoA reductase degradation protein 1 (HRD1)-has advanced substantially over the past decade. SEL1L-HRD1-mediated ERAD is now recognized as a fundamental process in mammals that governs various physiological functions largely in a substrate-specific manner. In humans, mutations in this complex have been causally linked to ERAD-associated neurodevelopmental disorders with onset in infancy (ENDI) and ENDI-agammaglobulinaemia. This Review highlights the SEL1L-HRD1-mediated ERAD pathway, exploring its machinery, molecular mechanism and physiological relevance and potential therapeutic strategies targeting this system.",Nature cell biology,2025,Huilun Helen Wang; Ida Biunno; Shengyi Sun; Ling Qi
40562808,Comprehensive analysis of CNOT3-related neurodevelopmental disorders: phenotypic and genotypic characterization.,"The CCR4-NOT complex, crucial in gene expression regulation, includes CNOT3, a subunit linked to neurodevelopmental disorders when mutated. This study investigates 51 patients from 42 families with heterozygous CNOT3 variants, aiming to expand the understanding of CNOT3-related neurodevelopmental disorders and explore genotype-phenotype correlations. Patients originated from various countries, reflecting the disorder's global significance. All patients exhibited developmental delays, particularly in the language area. Intellectual disability was found in 87% of patients and was typically mild to moderate. Behavioral issues, including autism spectrum disorders and attention deficits, were common, affecting over half of the patients. Dysmorphic features were highlighted and may help establishing the diagnosis. Epilepsy was uncommon (10%). Twenty-eight novel variants were identified, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, intronic variations and a deletion of 12 exons. Missense variants clustered at the N- and C-terminal regions of the protein, indicating critical functional roles. No clear genotype-phenotype correlation was observed, suggesting that all identified variants resulted in a loss-of-function effect. Finally, this work delineates the clinical and molecular spectrum of CNOT3-related disorders thanks to an in-depth characterization of a large cohort. Further research will be necessary to understand the functional consequences of the variants and enhance patient long-term outcomes.",European journal of human genetics : EJHG,2025,Camille Engel; Michaela Rendek; Jessica Assoumani; Emanuela Argilli; Francesca Ariani; Anne-Laude Avice-Denizet; Emilia K Bijlsmaa; Pierre Blanc; Lucia Pia Bruno; Bert Callewaert; Valeria Capra; Michele Carullo; Bertrand Chesneau; Sandra Coppens; Cynthia Curry; Breanne Dale; Eric Dahlen; Andrée Delahaye-Duriez; Anne-Sophie Denommé-Pichon; Bénédicte Demeer; Lenka Dvořáková; Jan Fischer; David Geneviève; Thea Giacomini; Mette M Handrup; Delphine Heron; Irina Hüning; Michelle Iacomino; Bertrand Isidor; Boris Keren; Stanislav Kmoch; David A Koolen; Andrea Kübler; Jana Laštůvková; Carolyn Le; Jonathan Levy; Caterina Lo Rizzo; Silvia Maitz; Sandrine Marlin; Cyril Mignot; Ghayda Mirzaa; Inga Nagel; Sebastian Neuens; Lenka Nosková; Emily Pao; Anna Pecková; Julie Plaisancie; Joseph Porrmann; Flavia Privitera; André Reis; Alessandra Renieri; Marlène Rio; Alyssa Rippert; Lukáš Ryba; Marcello Scala; Jolanda H Schieving; Elliott H Sherr; Andrew Shuen; Richard Sidlow; Thomas Smol; Julie Soblet; Pasquale Striano; Mohnish Suri; Hannes Syryn; Frédéric Tran Mau-Them; Andre M Travessa; Julien Van Gils; Georgia Vasileiou; Jolijn J A Verseput; Catheline Vilain; Catherine Vincent-Delorme; Emílie Vyhnálková; Emma L Wakeling; Pia Zacher; Federico Zara; Paul Kuentz; Juliette Piard
40562807,Identification of novel therapeutic targets for cognitive performance and associations with brain health.,"Cognitive dysfunction poses a significant challenge in clinical practice, but currently available drugs mainly address symptoms and have limited effectiveness in treating cognitive dysfunction associated with various neurological disorders. Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization analyses were conducted to explore the causal associations between 4302 druggable genes with blood and brain cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and cognitive performance. The causal effects of candidate druggable genes on brain structure and neurological diseases were assessed to gain insights into the underlying mechanisms. Among over 4000 druggable genes, our study identified causal associations between 72 druggable genes (41 blood eQTLs and 31 brain eQTLs) and cognitive performance. Thirteen eQTLs (six in blood: ERBB3, SPEG, ATP2A1, GDF11, CYP2D6, GANAB; seven in brain: ERBB3, DPYD, TAB1, WNT4, CLCN2, PPM1B, CAMKV) were identified as candidate druggable genes for cognitive performance. Notably, both blood and brain eQTLs of ERBB3 were negatively associated with cognitive performance (blood: OR = 0.933, 95% CI 0.911-0.956, p-value = 9.69E-09; brain: OR = 0.782, 95% CI 0.718-0.852, p-value = 2.13E-08). Moreover, these candidate druggable genes exhibited causal effects on both brain structure and neurological diseases. Our integrative analysis provides genetic evidence supporting candidate therapeutic targets for improving cognitive performance and treating neurological diseases. Furthermore, it sheds light on the possible mechanisms by which these targets affect brain structures. This finding suggested that these identified druggable genes, particularly ERBB3 and CYP2D6, hold promise as potential drug targets for enhancing cognitive performance.",Translational psychiatry,2025,Lu-Yang Zhang; Yu-Xin Liu; Yun-Hui Chu; Yun-Fan You; Luo-Qi Zhou; Sheng Yang; Ming-Hao Dong; Hang Zhang; Xiao-Wei Pang; Lian Chen; Li-Fang Zhu; Jun Xiao; Ke Shang; Wei Wang; Chuan Qin; Dai-Shi Tian
40562790,Prion-induced ferroptosis is facilitated by RAC3.,"Prions are infectious agents that initiate transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, causing devastating neuronal destruction in Creutzfeldt-Jakob and Kuru disease. Rapid cell death depends on presence of the endogenous prion protein PrP<sup>C</sup>, but its mechanistic contribution to pathogenesis is unclear. Here we investigate the molecular role of PrP<sup>C</sup>, reactive oxygen species and lipid metabolism in ferroptosis susceptibility, a regulated cell death process characterized by lipid peroxidation. We discover that elevated expression of the cellular prion PrP<sup>C</sup> creates a relaxed oxidative milieu that favors accumulation of unsaturated long-chain phospholipids responsible for ferroptotic death. This condition is sustained by the luminal protein glutathione peroxidase 8, which detoxifies reactive species produced by protein misfolding. Consequently, both PrP<sup>C</sup> and infectious Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) prions trigger ferroptotic markers and sensitization. This lethality is further enhanced by RAC3, a small GTPase. Depletion of RAC3 is observed solely in pathologically afflicted cortices in CJD patients, revealing a synergistic modulation of lipids and reactive species that drives ferroptosis susceptibility. Together, the results show that PrP<sup>C</sup> initially suppresses oxidative stress, attenuates cellular defenses, and establishes a systemic vulnerability to the ferroptotic cascade. These results provide insight into the mechanism underlying regulation of ferroptosis in prion diseases and highlight potential therapeutic targets for diseases involving dysregulated cell death processes.",Nature communications,2025,Hao Peng; Susanne Pfeiffer; Borys Varynskyi; Marina Qiu; Chanikarn Srinark; Xiang Jin; Xin Zhang; Katie Williams; Bradley R Groveman; Simote T Foliaki; Brent Race; Tina Thomas; Chengxuan Chen; Constanze Müller; Krisztina Kovács; Thomas Arzberger; Stefan Momma; Cathryn L Haigh; Joel A Schick
40562771,AAV-based delivery of RNAi targeting ataxin-2 improves survival and pathology in TDP-43 mice.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) involves motor neuron death due to mislocalized TDP-43. Pathologic TDP-43 associates with stress granules (SGs), and lowering the SG-associated protein ataxin-2 (ATXN2) using Atxn2-targeting antisense oligonucleotides prolongs survival in TAR4/4 sporadic ALS mice but failed in clinical trials likely due to poor target engagement. Here we show that an AAV with potent motor neuron transduction delivering Atxn2-targeting miRNAs reduces Atxn2 throughout the central nervous system at doses 40x lower than published work. In TAR4/4 mice, miAtxn2 increased survival (50%) and strength, and reduced motor neuron death, inflammation, and phosphorylated TDP-43. TAR4/4 transcriptomic dysregulation recapitulated ALS gene signatures that were rescued by miAtxn2, identifying potential therapeutic mechanisms and biomarkers. In slow progressing hemizygous mice, miAtxn2 slowed disease progression, and in ALS patient-derived lower motor neurons, our AAV vector transduced >95% of cells and potently reduced ATXN2 at MOI 4 logs lower than previously reported. These data support AAV-RNAi targeting ATXN2 as a translatable therapy for sporadic ALS.",Nature communications,2025,Defne A Amado; Ashley B Robbins; Katherine R Whiteman; Alicia R Smith; Guillem Chillon; Yonghong Chen; Joshua A Fuller; Nicholas A Patty; Aleksandar Izda; Congsheng Cheng; Shareen Nelson; Abigail I Dichter; Esteban O Mazzoni; Alex Mas Monteys; Beverly L Davidson
40562759,Elevated plasma GDF15 combined with FGF21 suggests mitochondrial dysfunction in a subgroup of anorexia nervosa patients.,"Growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is a significant player in cellular stress and energy homeostasis. GDF15 is elevated in cancer cachexia, chemotherapy-induced anorexia, hyperemesis gravidarum, and mitochondrial disorders. Here we analyze GDF15 in anorexia nervosa (AN), a psychiatric disorder characterized by low weight and persistent restriction of food intake. While no significant difference in plasma GDF15 concentration was seen across the three included groups; active AN, recovered AN, and healthy controls, a subgroup of study participants with high GDF15 plasma was noted to a significantly higher extent in the AN groups. Sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) identified six markers related to inflammatory processes or cellular stress from a set of 74 markers that distinguished AN with high GDF15 from the rest, with fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) being the most important contributor. Moreover, FGF21 plasma concentration was significantly higher in the group with high GDF15, suggesting an involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction. In fact, mitochondrial polygenic risk score (PRS) was significantly associated with AN risk in a large AN case-control cohort. In line with this, we also report elevated liver expression of GDF15 in the anx/anx mouse displaying anorexia associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. We conclude that mitochondrial dysfunction should be further explored in AN. Clinical trials of GDF15 immunoneutralization in patients with AN and high levels of GDF15 are worthy of consideration.",Translational psychiatry,2025,Jingjing Xu; Ruyue Zhang; Vincent Millischer; Miranda Stiernborg; Claire E Tume; Sara Mehdinia; Peter Barker; Zeynep Yilmaz; Vanessa F Gonçalves; Catharina Lavebratt; Mikael Landén; Stephen O'Rahilly; Cynthia M Bulik; Ida Ak Nilsson
40562757,Results of upper cervical palpation test in migraine patients are not explained by pain sensitization.,"The exact cause for no pain, local pain and referred pain groups according to the upper cervical palpation test (UPT) and whether neck pain in migraine patients is caused due to pain sensitization or influenced by perceived neck-related disability, is not fully understood. The aim was to determine whether upper cervical spine sensitivity tested by the UPT is associated with neck-related disability or increased pain sensitization in patients with migraine. Forty-two patients with episodic migraine were examined regarding mechanical and pressure pain thresholds, central sensitization (CSI), allodynia (ASC-12) and neck-related disability (NDI), and sub-grouped according to the UPT. An ANOVA analysis was performed for group differences. Exploratory regression and correlation analyses were performed with NDI and CSI as dependent variables to understand which factors are related and contribute to either subgroup allocation. No significant differences were found in UPT subgroups regarding CSI and NDI. The UPT subgroups could not be determined by any evaluated variable. The NDI was explained in 43.6% by the CSI and neck pain intensity. CSI results were explained to 49.4% by a model including ASC-12 and NDI. In conclusion, UPT subgroups were neither explained by differences in CSI, mechanical or pressure threshold testing or NDI.",Scientific reports,2025,Juliana Pradela; Melanie Maria Otto; Emily Kaske; Luise John; Nicole Derner; Arne Vielitz; Kerstin Luedtke
40562749,ETMR stem-like state and chemo-resistance are supported by perivascular cells at single-cell resolution.,"Embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes (ETMR) is a lethal embryonal brain tumor entity. To investigate the intratumoral heterogeneity and cellular communication in the tumor microenvironment (TME), we analyze in this work single-cell RNA sequencing of about 250,000 cells of primary human and murine ETMR, in vitro cultures, and a 3D forebrain organoid model of ETMR, supporting the main findings with immunohistochemistry and spatial transcriptomics of human tumors. We characterize three distinct malignant ETMR subpopulations - RG-like, NProg-like and NB-like - positioned within a putative neurodevelopmental hierarchy. We reveal PDGFRβ<sup>+</sup> pericytes as key communication partners in the TME, contributing to stem cell signaling through extracellular matrix-mediated interactions with tumor cells. PDGF signaling is upregulated in chemoresistant RG-like cells in vivo and plays a role in recruiting pericytes to ETMR TME by finalizing a signaling cascade which promotes the differentiation of non-malignant radial glia cells, derived from our 3D model, into pericyte-like cells. Selective PDGFR-inhibition blocked the lineage differentiation into pericytes in vitro and reduced the tumor cell population in vivo. Targeting ETMR-pericyte interactions in the TME presents a promising therapeutic approach.",Nature communications,2025,Flavia W de Faria; Nicole C Riedel; Daniel Münter; Marta Interlandi; Carolin Göbel; Lea Altendorf; Mathis Richter; Viktoria Melcher; Christian Thomas; Rajanya Roy; Melanie Schoof; Ivan Bedzhov; Natalia Moreno; Monika Graf; Marc Hotfilder; Dörthe Holdhof; Wolfgang Hartmann; Ann-Katrin Bruns; Angela Brentrup; Friederike Liesche-Starnecker; Bruno Maerkl; Sarah Sandmann; Julian Varghese; Martin Dugas; Pedro H Pinto; Sebastian T Balbach; I-Na Lu; Claudia Rossig; Oliver Soehnlein; Aysegül Canak; Martin Ebinger; Martin Schuhmann; Jens Schittenhelm; Michael F Frühwald; Ulrich Schüller; Thomas K Albert; Carolin Walter; Jan M Bruder; Kornelius Kerl

40562716,Capillaries susceptible to frequent stall dynamics revealed by comparing OCT and bessel-2PM measurements.,"Transient stoppages of red blood cell (RBC) flow through capillaries-termed capillary stalls-occur persistently in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and ischemic stroke and can interrupt oxygen delivery and exacerbate neurological damage. Effective imaging tools and analyses are necessary to understand the nature, role, and prevention of stalls. In this study, we dissect differences in stalls measured by two-photon Bessel beam microscopy (Bessel-2PM) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) to gain insight into the temporal dynamics of stalls. Twenty-minute series of volumetric angiograms were obtained separately with Bessel-2PM and OCT on the same day in awake, head-fixed mice. The temporal dynamics of stalling in both methods revealed a minority population of susceptible capillaries that exhibited frequent stalls and a large majority of capillaries with infrequent stalls. Differences between OCT and Bessel-2PM in the repeatability and dynamics of stalls are explained by differences in their sensitivity to short or infrequent stalls based on scanning speed and detection off-time. Finally, stroke caused a shift toward the frequently stalling capillary subpopulation, lasting 1 week post-stroke. Dynamic stall analysis therefore enables examination of physiological and methodological contributions to the stalls measured in disease models and across studies.",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,2025,Rockwell P Tang; Shannon Kelley; Gülce Küreli; Emily A Long; Piergiulio R Bressan; Shashwat Shah; Şefik E Erdener; John Jiang; John T Giblin; Sreekanth Kura; Matthew G Simkulet; Bradley C Rauscher; Chris B Schaffer; Nozomi Nishimura; Martin Thunemann; Anna Devor; David A Boas
40562683,Clinical and genetic determinants of worse sexual experience in male patients with radiographic axial spondyloarthritis: a multimodal study.,"The expression and experience of sexuality is a key part of an individual's self-identity, yet it is often overlooked in clinical settings. This study aims to evaluate the impact of radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (r-axSpA) on sexual experience in male patients, identify contributing factors and explore the potential causal relationship between r-axSpA and erectile dysfunction (ED). We assessed the sexual experience of 113 male patients with r-axSpA and 73 healthy people using the Sexual Experience Questionnaire in the cross-sectional study. Linear regression analysis was used to explore the contributions of clinical factors to worse sexual experience. A two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) design was conducted to examine the potential causal association of r-axSpA with the risk of ED. There was a significant difference in the total sexual experience score between patients with r-axSpA and healthy controls (41.81±8.71 vs 50.23±8.82, p<0.001). Patients with r-axSpA had a worse score in all dimensions of sexual experience, including erectile function, individual satisfaction and couple satisfaction, compared with healthy individuals. In the regression model adjusted for age, disease duration and body mass index, disease activity (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index), physical function (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index), mobility (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index, chest expansion and finger-floor distance), health index (Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society Health Index), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and psychological status (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), HADS-Anxiety and HADS-Depression) were significant determinants of sexual experience. The two-sample MR analysis demonstrated no causal effect of r-axSpA on the risk of ED (OR: 0.973; 95% CI: 0.824 to 1.149; p=0.749) based on the inverse variance weighted method. Sensitivity analyses supported the result, with no evidence of directional pleiotropy. Worse sexual experience was associated with increased disease activity, reduced mobility, lower health index, poor sleep quality and psychological status. Genetic-level evidence indicated no direct causal relationship between r-axSpA and ED. Therefore, actively assessing disease-related suffering and developing new management strategies are essential for improving sexual experience in patients with r-axSpA.",RMD open,2025,Lidong Hu; Dai Gao; Xiaojian Ji; Yiwen Wang; Xingkang Liu; Jianglin Zhang; Jian Zhu; Feng Huang
40562637,Brain morphological characteristics predicting clinical response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or cholinesterase inhibitors: A study of electronic medical records in patients with cognitive disorders.,"Current treatments for cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), such as cholinesterase inhibitors (CEIs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), show inconsistent effectiveness, necessitating a personalized therapy approach. We aimed to develop predictive models using MRI-derived brain neuroanatomical features and clinical data to forecast responses to CEIs and SSRIs in ADRD patients. This was a retrospective observational analysis of electronic health records (EHRs) and MRI data conducted within Johns Hopkins Medical Systems. Cohort 1 comprised 179 patients prescribed CEIs or SSRIs for the first time with over a year of follow-up. Cohort 2 included 1244 patients with similar criteria to explore clinical characteristics linked to MRI features affecting treatment benefits. Medication efficacy was assessed via a Likert scale based on EMR descriptions. We quantified brain volumes across 280 anatomical areas on T1-weighted MRIs and applied an elastic net model after harmonizing volumes with the ComBat model. Predictive model efficacy was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Preserved volume in the nucleus basalis of Meynert correlated with better responses to both CEIs and SSRIs. Specific white matter volumes related to CEI benefits, while SSRI efficacy was linked to gray matter in the Nucleus Accumbens and frontal cortex. Area under ROC curve values were 0.82 for CEI and 0.75 for SSRI predictions. Older age and vascular factors were associated with reduced medication benefits. MRI-derived neuroanatomical features effectively predict medication responses in ADRD, potentially enabling more tailored treatment strategies.",International psychogeriatrics,2025,Kengo Onda; Jill S Chotiyanonta; Hannah P Cowley; Yuto Uchida; Milap A Nowrangi; Roy Adams; Constantine G Lyketsos; Peter P Zandi; Kenichi Oishi
40562636,Clinical trials for neuropsychiatric syndromes in major and mild neurocognitive disorders: A CONSORT-based approach.,"Neuropsychiatric syndromes (NPS) such as agitation, psychosis, apathy, and irritability are among the most disabling features of major and mild neurocognitive disorders including Alzheimer's disease, other neurodegenerative disorders (NDD), and vascular cognitive impairment. Clinical trial methodologies for the treatment of these syndromes are evolving and the first agents to reduce NPS severity has been approved. Biomarkers are rapidly becoming available to guide clinical trial decision-making. Biomarkers can confirm the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and are playing a larger role in non-Alzheimer trials. The Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) specify the elements of clinical trials that must be reported when clinical trials are published. These criteria provide conventions for uniform reporting of all key aspects of a clinical trial and facilitate comparisons across trials. We describe best practices for clinical trials of NPS including research definitions of the NDD, use of biomarkers to support clinical diagnosis, research criteria for NPS, use of rating scales to define the severity of NPS at baseline and as endpoints for the clinical trial, and approaches to data analysis of specific interest in NPS trials. Standards for describing the limitations of trials and their generalizability are provided. The goal is to inform planning and reporting of NPS trials including the use of biomarkers based on CONSORT guidelines for best trial practices.",International psychogeriatrics,2025,Jeffrey L Cummings; Kate Zhong; Clive Ballard; Mary Sano; Jacobo Mintzer
40562629,Neuroprotective properties of ciliary neurotrophic factor in the retina for the treatment of macular telangiectasia type 2.,"Neurotrophic factors are a family of proteins that promote the growth and survival of both developing and mature neurons. Extensive preclinical studies have demonstrated neuroprotective properties conferred by ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) in a variety of neuron types across several species. Neuroprotection that CNTF confers slows or prevents neuron loss and appears to be agnostic to the nature of the neurodegenerative mutation or injury. However, translation of these studies to the clinic remains a challenge due in part to delivery barriers inherent to the central nervous system and the short half-life of CNTF. The molecular effect of CNTF delivered by a variety of strategies in model systems has been extensively studied in the neural retina. Long-term retinal neuroprotection has been documented using encapsulated cells that have been genetically modified to produce a stable source of CNTF. Clinical trials have shown that CNTF is well tolerated for use in the human retina. This review focuses on the mechanism of action of CNTF and its potential as a therapeutic agent in retinal disease, with a focus on macular telangiectasia type 2 where CNTF has shown efficacy in slowing the rate of ellipsoid zone loss.",Cytokine & growth factor reviews,2025,Arne Nystuen; Eugene Gonzalez-Lopez; Konrad A Kauper; Kevin Eade; Thomas M Aaberg

40562543,Rapid diagnosis of bacterial meningitis using point-of-care PCR assay with negative cerebrospinal fluid culture.,"Meningitis due to <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> can be challenging to diagnose due to reliance on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture. CSF culture has variable diagnostic accuracy, requiring up to 48 hours to confirm bacterial growth and sensitivities. Point-of-care multiplex CSF PCR assays can provide a rapid diagnosis, confirming the presence of pathogenic genetic material from a panel within 1 hour. In this report, we describe a case of an adult teenage male with suspected bacterial meningitis, early disseminated intravascular coagulation and septicaemia. After 5 hours, a point-of-care CSF PCR test confirmed meningitis due to <i>N. meningitidis</i> infection.

40562542,From acute flaccid paralysis (AFP)-Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) and myelitis to progressive encephalopathy : acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) atypical presentation of rabies following dog bite.,"Rabies encephalitis is a rare but severe complication following dog bites, particularly when appropriate prophylaxis is not administered. We present the case of a tween girl, the firstborn child of a non-consanguineous married couple, who developed neurological symptoms following a category three dog bite. The child had received four doses of the rabies vaccine but did not receive Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG). She initially presented with progressive lower limb weakness followed by urinary retention, which eventually progressed to encephalopathy and dystonia. Initial diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome, later as transverse myelitis, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis was considered. Investigations, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, MRI, and Rabies virus neutralising antibody (RVNA) titers, led to a diagnosis of rabies encephalitis. This case emphasises the importance of clinical suspicion for rabies in children presenting with progressive lower limb weakness and the necessity of timely and complete post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent such rare but fatal outcomes.",BMJ case reports,2025,Vykuntaraju K Gowda; Archana Varghese; Nivedita P Doddamani; Viveka Santhosh Reddy Challa; Reeta S Mani; Sunitha Palasamudram Kumaran
40562512,The Impact of Cognitive Impairment on Cardiovascular Disease.,"The older adult population is the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population. Cardiovascular disease is common among older patients, which leads to excess morbidity, mortality, and health care utilization. Cognitive impairment is also common in older adults with cardiovascular disease and is expected to increase in parallel with cardiovascular disease because both conditions share the same underlying risk factors. Cardiovascular disease also exacerbates cognitive impairment through hypertension, cerebral hypoperfusion, inflammation, arrhythmia, emboli, and medication adverse events. Moreover, cognitive impairment can undermine the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease because of changes in health literacy, adherence, and even the likelihood that guideline-directed medical and/or interventional management are under-prescribed. Patients with cognitive impairment are also more likely to endure delays in care and reduced participation in formative cardiovascular trials. In this State-of-the-Art review, we aim to: 1) examine the distinct types of cognitive impairment prevalent among cardiac patients; 2) explore the fundamental pathophysiology and mechanisms of cognitive impairment in adults with cardiovascular disease; 3) delineate the bidirectional impact of cognitive impairment and cardiovascular disease; and 4) discuss evidence-based management strategies to mitigate cognitive impairment in patients with cardiovascular diseases.",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,2025,Yasser Jamil; Ashok Krishnaswami; Ariela R Orkaby; Marnina Stimmel; Charles H Brown Iv; Adam P Mecca; Daniel E Forman; Michael W Rich; Michael G Nanna; Abdulla A Damluji
40562469,Aortic Valve Replacement in Women: A Pooled Analysis of the RHEIA and PARTNER 3 Trials.,"In women with severe aortic stenosis, there are limited data regarding outcome differences following transcatheter (TAVR) vs surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). The authors sought to examine outcomes of TAVR vs SAVR in a patient-level pooled analysis of women in the RHEIA and PARTNER 3 trials. Patients in both trials were randomly allocated to a balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3/Ultra valve or to surgical bioprostheses. Individual patient data of female participants in the 2 trials were pooled. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, all stroke, or rehospitalization at 1 year. A total of 376 women were randomized to TAVR and 336 to SAVR. The mean age was ∼73 years, and the mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score was 2.1%. Kaplan-Meier estimates of event rates at 1 year with TAVR vs SAVR were 8.5% vs 16.8% for the composite of all-cause mortality, all stroke, or rehospitalization (absolute difference -8.2%; 95% CI: -13.1% to -3.3%; P < 0.001), 1.1% vs 2.1% (P = 0.27) for all-cause mortality, 2.7% vs 3.9% (P = 0.35) for all stroke, and 5.4% vs 11.9% (P = 0.002) for rehospitalization. The composite endpoint of all-cause death or stroke was similar between the 2 treatment groups: 3.5% vs 5.4% (absolute difference -1.9%; 95% CI: -5.0% to 1.1%; P = 0.21). Among women with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, TAVR led to a reduction in the rate of the combined endpoint of all-cause mortality, stroke, or rehospitalization at 1-year follow-up, largely due to a significant reduction in the rate of rehospitalization.",JACC.

40562467,15-Year Outcomes of PFO Closure in Patients With Cryptogenic Embolism: Insights From the PROLONG Registry.,"Transcatheter patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure has become the gold-standard treatment for patients with cryptogenic embolism and PFO, but long-term outcomes data are limited. The aim of this study was to report the extended clinical outcomes of patients who underwent transcatheter PFO closure for cryptogenic embolism. PROLONG (PFO Transcatheter Occlusion Long-Term Outcomes National Group) is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, retrospective registry that enrolled patients who underwent transcatheter PFO closure between 1999 and 2013 at 12 centers in Italy. This analysis included only patients who underwent PFO closure for cryptogenic embolism, defined as cryptogenic ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, systemic embolism, or silent ischemic lesions on magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical, imaging, procedural, and follow-up data were collected from electronic health records and telephone interviews. The study included 1,245 patients (mean age 47 ± 12 years, 56% women), with a mean follow-up duration of 14.5 ± 2.4 years. During follow-up, 34 patients (2.7%) experienced recurrent ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism (0.19 per 100 patient-years). Predictors of recurrent events were Risk of Paradoxical Embolism (RoPE) score ≤ 7 (HR: 3.44; 95% CI: 1.06-11.3; P = 0.041), nonprobable PFO-Associated Stroke Causal Likelihood (PASCAL) classification (HR: 2.72; 95% CI: 1.17-6.34; P = 0.020), and new-onset atrial fibrillation (HR: 7.01; 95% CI: 2.45-20.1; P < 0.001). Serious complications were rare (0.4% in hospital, 0.4% during follow-up) and nonfatal. This study confirms the long-term efficacy and safety of transcatheter PFO closure for patients with cryptogenic embolism and PFO in a real-world setting.

40562426,"Right C7 neurotomy at the intervertebral foramen plus intensive speech and language therapy versus intensive speech and language therapy alone for chronic post-stroke aphasia: multicentre, randomised controlled trial.","To evaluate whether right neurotomy of the seventh cervical nerve (C7) at the intervertebral foramen plus intensive speech and language therapy (SLT) improves language function compared intensive SLT alone in patients with chronic aphasia after stroke. Multicentre, assessor blinded, randomised controlled trial. Four centres in mainland China. 50 adults aged 40-65 years with aphasia for more than one year after a single left hemispheric stroke. Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive either C7 neurotomy plus three weeks of intensive SLT or three weeks of intensive SLT only, stratified by treatment centre. The primary outcome was change in score on the 60 item Boston naming test (BNT, scores 0-60, with higher scores indicating better naming function) from baseline to one week after C7 neurotomy plus intensive SLT for three weeks or intensive SLT for three weeks after deferral for one week (control group). Secondary outcomes included change in severity of aphasia using the aphasia quotient, calculated using the western aphasia battery, and patient reported outcomes on quality of life and depression after stroke. From 25 July 2022 to 31 July 2023, 322 out of 1086 patients received a diagnosis of post-stroke aphasia and were screened for eligibility. 50 eligible participants were randomly assigned to treatment groups (25 in each). Mean increase in BNT score was 11.16 points in the neurotomy plus SLT group and 2.72 points in the control group at one month (difference 8.51 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.31 to 11.71, P<0.001). The between group difference in BNT score remained stable at six months (difference 8.26 points, 4.16 to 12.35, P<0.001). In addition, the aphasia quotient improved significantly in the neurotomy plus SLT group versus control group (difference at one month 7.06 points, 4.41 to 9.72, P<0.001), as did patient reported activities of daily living and post-stroke depression. No treatment related severe adverse events were reported. C7 neurotomy plus three weeks of intensive SLT was associated with a greater improvement in language function compared with three weeks of intensive SLT alone over a period of six months. No severe adverse events or long term troublesome symptoms or functional loss were reported.

40562419,"Brexanolone, zuranolone and related neurosteroid GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor positive allosteric modulators for postnatal depression.","Postnatal depression - depression that occurs up to one year after a woman has given birth - is an important and common disorder that can have short- and long-term adverse impacts on the mother, her child and the family as a whole. Recommended treatment for postnatal depression is psychological therapy, and for more severe depression, antidepressants. However, many antidepressants are associated with limited response. Neurosteroid gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptor positive allosteric modulators have been developed for the treatment of depression, including postnatal depression, and have a different mechanism of action than traditional antidepressants. To assess the benefits and harms of brexanolone, zuranolone and related neurosteroid GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor positive allosteric modulators compared to another active treatment (pharmacological, psychological or psychosocial), placebo or treatment as usual for postnatal depression. We searched Cochrane Common Mental Disorders' Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO in January 2024. We also searched two international trials registries and contacted experts in the field to identify the studies that are included in the review. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of women with depression during the first 12 months following childbirth that compared neurosteroid GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor positive allosteric modulators with any other treatment (pharmacological, psychological or psychosocial), placebo or treatment as usual. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. The primary outcomes were depression response, depression remission and adverse events experienced by the mother, nursing baby, or both. The secondary outcomes were depression severity, treatment acceptability, quality of life and parenting- and child-related outcomes. We grouped analyses according to whether the neurosteroid GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor positive allosteric modulator was intravenous or oral. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE criteria. We identified six RCTs (674 women); all were placebo-controlled trials. Three studies tested intravenous brexanolone; one, intravenous ganaxolone; and two studies, oral zuranolone. Sample sizes ranged from 21 to 196. All were conducted in the USA. We judged the risks of selection, performance, detection, attrition and reporting biases to mostly be low, although the risk of selection and attrition bias was unclear in two studies. The biopharmaceutical companies which made the drugs sponsored all six included studies. They appear to have had a considerable role in the design and conduct of the studies. Intravenous neurosteroid GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor positive allosteric modulators versus placebo Low-certainty evidence suggests there may be little or no difference in depression response (risk ratio (RR) 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 2.06; I<sup>2</sup> = 78%; 3 studies, 267 women) or remission (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.38; I<sup>2</sup> = 73%; 3 studies, 267 women) at 30 days (classified in this review as the 'early phase' of treatment: between 0 and 5 weeks from commencement of treatment). There is also probably little or no difference in the number of adverse events affecting the mother (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.48; I<sup>2</sup> = 46%; 4 studies, 325 women; moderate-certainty evidence). There is low-certainty evidence that there may be little or no difference in depression severity (mean difference (MD) -4.22, 95% CI -8.46 to 0.02; I<sup>2</sup> = 78%; 3 studies, 267 women) in the early phase (at 30 days following commencement of treatment); Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) score range 0 to 52. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests lower acceptability than placebo, leading to study dropout (RR 2.77, 95% CI 1.22 to 6.26; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 3 studies, 267 women). No studies measured quality of life or parenting- and child-related outcomes. Oral zuranolone versus placebo Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that zuranolone is probably associated with an improvement in depression response (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.55; I<sup>2</sup> = 13%; 2 studies, 349 women) and remission (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.22; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 2 studies, 349 women) at 45 days from commencement of treatment. Moderate-certainty evidence also suggests that zuranolone probably increases the rate of maternal adverse events (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.48; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 2 studies, 349 women), when all adverse events are considered; the most frequent adverse event was somnolence. Zuranolone is also probably effective in reducing depression severity at day 45 (MD -3.79, 95% CI -5.60 to -1.97; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 2 studies, 349 women; moderate-certainty evidence); HAMD-17 score range 0 to 52. Low-certainty evidence suggests little or no difference in terms of treatment acceptability between zuranolone and placebo (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.81; I<sup>2</sup> = 5%; 2 studies, 349 women). No studies measured quality of life. One study reported the Barkin Index of Maternal Functioning (a validated measure of patient-reported maternal functioning within the first year of childbirth), and found that zuranolone improved maternal functioning at day 45 (MD 7.20, 95% CI 1.42 to 12.98; 153 women), but the certainty of this evidence was low. This review provides moderate-certainty evidence that zuranolone probably improves depression response and remission but also increases maternal adverse events compared to placebo. There may be little or no difference in depression response and remission and probably little or no difference in maternal adverse events with intravenous neurosteroid GABA<sub>A</sub> positive allosteric modulators such as brexanolone, compared to placebo. Evidence from this review, alongside current clinical guidelines and reference to evidence from the general adult population, could be used to inform an individualised risk-benefit discussion with women seeking treatment for postnatal depression. However, it is difficult to make recommendations about the use of neurosteroid GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor positive allosteric modulators for the treatment of postnatal depression as no studies have compared them to active treatment.",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2025,Claire A Wilson; Lindsay Robertson; Karyn Ayre; Jessica L Hendon; Sarah Dawson; Charlene Bridges; Hind Khalifeh
40562404,Unilateral involuntary movements of the limbs with caudate nucleus restricted diffusion on magnetic resonance imaging: A case report.,"Anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated-1 (LGI1) autoimmune encephalitis is one of the most prevalent forms of autoantibody-associated limbic encephalitis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging of patients with anti-LGI1 encephalitis often presents as fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensities of the medial temporal lobe. We report the case of a man in his early 60s who suddenly experienced involuntary movement of the right limbs. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed normal T1 signal and T2 hyperintensity in the left caudate nucleus, with corresponding fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity, diffusion-weighted imaging hyperintensity, and apparent diffusion coefficient hypointensity. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with anti-LGI1 autoimmune encephalitis. For patients with unilateral involuntary movement accompanied by restricted diffusion in the basal ganglia region, anti-LGI1 encephalitis should be considered.",The Journal of international medical research,2025,Lan Deng; Bing-Hu Li

This study examined the impact of youth-level factors (i.e., age, verbal and cognitive ability, adaptive skills) on anxiety self-report completion and parent-youth agreement among 72 autistic adolescents with ID. We also examined if parent accommodation behaviors, such as reassurance or routine modification, served as predictors of parent-youth agreement of anxiety. Results showed that 83% of adolescents completed the self-report measure, with verbal, cognitive, and adaptive ability predicting completion. Parental accommodation predicted parent-youth agreement on physical anxiety symptoms, but not global anxiety symptoms. Youth-level factors did not significantly predict agreement. Results highlight the need for expanded assessment approaches for assessing anxiety in youth with ID.",American journal on intellectual and developmental disabilities,2025,Elizabeth Glenn; Allison Meyer; Audrey Blakeley-Smith

Accordingly, interventions including behaviorally-oriented and mind-body programs are associated with decreased stress and increased mental health. Caregivers (n = 22) of autistic children (aged 5-12) were randomized to group psychoeducation or mindfulness program for 8 weeks. Psychological and physiological measures included heart rate variability (HRV), sleep, parental stress, and perceived health. Both groups demonstrated improvement HRV, perceived parental stress, and perceived global health.

40562378,A diagnostic approach to neurocutaneous syndromes.,"Neurocutaneous syndromes are a group of genetically and phenotypically diverse disorders that primarily affect the skin, central and peripheral nervous systems, and eyes. Classifying neurocutaneous syndromes based on genetic mechanisms often proves impractical in routine clinical settings. This review proposes a practical classification of neurocutaneous syndromes based on their neurological manifestations, including neoplastic lesions, epilepsy, vascular abnormalities, and ataxia. In this narrative review, we examined original articles and reviews that explore neurocutaneous syndromes, published between January 2000 and July 2024. The figures are part of a personal collection of the authors. Early recognition of dermatological and neurological hallmarks can guide diagnosis and prompt timely evaluation and treatment. Therefore, a thorough understanding of neurocutaneous syndromes highlights the importance of integrated diagnostic strategies that combine neurological and dermatological assessments.",Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria,2025,Sofia Mônaco Gama; João Vitor Gerdulli Tamanini; Marianna Pinheiro Moraes de Moraes; Thiago Yoshinaga Tonholo Silva; Fernanda Teresa de Lima; José Luiz Pedroso; Orlando Graziani Povoas Barsottini
40562372,Delayed cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a narrative review.,"Aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is a condition with elevated mortality and morbidity, which usually affects a working-age population, leading to a high socioeconomic burden. Among those who survive the initial bleeding, approximately 30% will experience delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), which is a significant factor in poor outcomes. However, it is potentially reversible if appropriate treatment is promptly initiated. The amount of blood present on the initial computed tomography (CT) scan, assessed through the modified Fisher scale (mFisher), and the patient's neurological status upon admission, are the strongest predictors of DCI. Early prevention is essential and typically involves administration of enteral nimodipine and the maintenance of euvolemia, while other treatment options have limited supporting evidence. Diagnosing remains a challenge, primarily due to its reliance on clinical examinations. This is more pronounced in high-grade aSAH patients who are unconscious or sedated. In such cases, additional methods may be necessary, such as transcranial Doppler (TCD), continuous electroencephalography (cEEG), or CT with perfusion (CTP). Treatment aims to prevent cerebral infarction and poor clinical outcomes, and it is based on hemodynamic optimization, hypertension induction, cardiac output augmentation, and endovascular therapy. Nevertheless, randomized data on DCI management remains scarce, highlighting the urgent need for more studies and a better understanding of this SAH complication. Addressing this gap may lead to more effective preventive strategies and treatments, which is crucial for improving the prognosis of these patients.",Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria,2025,Ingrid Pereira Marques; Carolina Rouanet Cavalcanti de Albuquerque; Natalia Vasconcellos de Oliveira Souza; João Brainer Clares de Andrade; Gisele Sampaio Silva; Pedro Kurtz
40562371,Acute arterial ischemic stroke in children: single-center experience.,"Arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) is an increasingly common disorder in childhood that causes severe mortality and morbidity.To emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of AIS cases, as well as the early initiation of physical therapy.We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 23 patients aged 1 month to 18 years, who were admitted with acute neurological complaints and diagnosed radiologically with AIS at the Bursa Yüksek İhtisas Training and Research Hospital, a tertiary healthcare facility, between January 2016 and June 2020.Neurological deficit was the most common (12 patients; 52%) complaint, followed by seizure in 5 patients (21%), facial paralysis in 5 patients (21%), and visual impairment in 3 patients (13%). We performed brain computed tomography (CT) scans in 12 (52%) patients at the first application, and infarction was detected in 8 (66%). Infarction was in the cerebrum in 19 (82%) patients. Mutations of the <i>methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase</i> (<i>MTHFR</i>; A1298C and 677C > T) gene were found most frequently. Cardiac anomalies were detected in 7 (30%) patients, and 2 patients had ventriculoperitoneal shunts.Arterial ischemic stroke presents very different clinical findings, such as hiccups, anisocoria, and upward gaze paralysis. We wanted to emphasize the importance of cranial CT scanning because sometimes MRI is not always easily performed in children. Concomitant conditions, such as intracranial operation, ventriculoperitoneal shunt, and hypochondroplasia, may increase the risk of stroke.",Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria,2025,Muharrem Bostancı; Arzu Ekici; Cengiz Havalı
40562370,The impact of changing diagnostic criteria on disability in a Brazilian multiple sclerosis cohort.,"Updating multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnostic criteria over recent decades may have impacted disability progression.To assess the effects of the passage of time and changes in diagnostic criteria on disability.A retrospective study of Brazilian people with relapsing-remitting MS from 1994 to 2019. Descriptive analysis compared three periods based on admission: Epoch 1 (1994-2001), 2 (2002-2010), and 3 (2011-2019). Cox regressions were performed for the outcomes of the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) 6.0 and conversion to secondary progressive MS (SPMS). We compared the three Epochs in sequence, the Poser with all McDonald criteria combined, and Poser versus each McDonald criteria (2001, 2005, 2010, and 2017). A multivariate logistic regression assessed the impact of diagnostic criteria on patients reaching EDSS 6.0.Time to diagnosis and treatment decreased across Epochs. For reaching EDSS 6.0, the Cox regression indicated a hazard ratio (HR) 63% lower for Epoch 3 compared with 1, an HR 50% lower for the McDonald criteria combined, and an HR 65% lower for McDonald 2010 compared with Poser. Regarding the conversion to SPMS, the HR was 53% lower for Epoch 3, 48% lower for the McDonald criteria combined, and 64% lower for McDonald 2010. The multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that incomplete recovery of initial symptoms was the main prognostic factor for reaching EDSS 6.0. However, transitioning diagnostic criteria from Poser to McDonald 2001 and 2005 decreased these odds by 54%.Newer diagnostic criteria have reduced the likelihood of reaching EDSS 6.0 and converting to SPMS over the past 25 years.",Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria,2025,Felipe Toscano Lins de Menezes; Jéssica Monique Dias Alencar; Alexandre Bussinger Lopes; Leizian de Souza Amorim; Raquel Paiva Portugal; Flávia Timbó Albuquerque; Natasha Pryanca de Araújo Bessa; Larissa Sabino Ferreira Vicente; Nilton Amorim de Souza; Denis Bernardi Bichuetti; Enedina Maria Lobato de Oliveira
40562349,Tobacco smoking is associated with attenuated error monitoring.,"Addiction is associated with neurophysiological deficits in error monitoring (EM), i.e., the continuous assessment of ongoing actions and comparing the outcomes of these actions with internal goals and standards, measured by, e.g., event-related potentials (ERPs). For tobacco smoking, the largest global substance addiction, there is no firm conclusion on the relation with EM due to a paucity of studies. A relatively large gender-balanced sample (N=92, of which 44 smoking participants) performed the Eriksen-flanker task while the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. The error-related negativity (ERN) and the error positivity (Pe) were measured, as well as event-related oscillations (EROs) in the theta and delta frequency bands. The results show a blunted ERN and Pe in smoking participants compared to non-smoking participants, providing evidence for attenuated error detection and salience. Reduced power in transient event-related theta and delta oscillations for smoking participants appeared to underlie the weaker ERN and Pe, respectively. There was no group difference in behavioral performance. Group differences in Pe/Pc, theta, and delta band power remained after robustness testing (i.e., 80% reliability criterium with 18 trials in each condition). Attenuated error monitoring was found for people who smoke tobacco, manifested as a blunted ERN and Pe, which appear to be driven by reduced bursts of theta and delta power, respectively. This shows that tobacco smoking is associated with a robust deficit in EM that has been found in other substance use disorders, and it appears to increase with dependence severity.",Biological psychology,2025,C Henrico Stam; Frederik M van der Veen; Vaughn R Steele; Ingmar H A Franken
40562281,Interplay between Exercise and Neuregulin in providing neuroprotection.,"Exercise has been shown to have a positive impact on brain health including neuroprotective function. It has been demonstrated to increase the synthesis of neurotrophic factors, support neuronal survival, and improve neuroplasticity. Concurrently, neuregulin plays a vital role in the development, maintenance, and repair of both the central and peripheral nervous system. The link between exercise and neuregulin in mediating neuroprotection has been the subject of increased research to better understand the possible applications for the deterrence of neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding this link is of great interest because it has the potential to lead to new strategies for preventing or slowing the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. With an emphasis on exercise-induced neuregulin-mediated neuroprotection, this article reviews the literature on the neuroprotective effects of exercise and neuregulin. The synergistic effects of exercise and neuregulin on neuroprotection will be clarified and valuable insights will be gained from this review, with potential implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Huntington's disease (HD).",Behavioural brain research,2025,Jyotsna Sharma; Abhimanyu Thakur; Manjari Rain; Radhika Khosla; Kalyan Maity; Gaurav Raj Mathur; Akshay Anand
40562227,Multi-ingredient energy dietary supplement with a small amount of caffeine modulates central and autonomic nervous system after a single use.,"Most research on the impact of neurostimulatory substances on brain function and human behavior focuses on the adverse effects of their high doses or long-term use. However, little is known about the impact of single doses that contain psychostimulants only in a small amount. Therefore, we investigated the acute effect of an energy dietary multi-ingredient supplement with a low amount of caffeine (55 mg) on the ANS in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (47 participants, 27 women). Previously, we reported its impact on the activity of the CNS through changes in the resting state EEG (rsEEG) pattern and event-related brain potentials by reversing the fatigue-related brain activity. Here, we show that supplementation also influences the ANS through changes in heart electrophysiology. The supplement changed the PRQ and QTc intervals in the ECG signal. In addition, LF power changes were correlated with the changes in rsEEG, which we reported earlier. These findings show that a single dose of dietary supplementation with a much smaller dose of caffeine than in typical caffeinated products may still impact both the CNS and ANS. The results indicate that using such products before electrophysiological examinations in research, diagnostics, and treatment should be considered to control confounding factors. Finally, since the effects were elicited by an energy boost supplement in the mentally fatigued participants, it may be of special importance and enable translation into treatments related to attention, anxiety, mood, and memory disorders.",Neuroscience,2025,Karina Maciejewska; Klaudia Duch; Maciej Giza; Aleksandra Nas
40562213,"Understanding emotional fatigue: a systematic review of causes, consequences, and coping strategies.","Emotional fatigue, a significant component of burnout, is increasingly recognized as a critical issue affecting healthcare professionals and other high-stress occupations. This systematic review identifies the causes, consequences, and coping strategies associated with emotional fatigue in healthcare workers. A comprehensive search of peer-reviewed articles was conducted across multiple databases. The selection criteria focused on studies that explicitly addressed emotional fatigue, its determinants, impacts, and coping mechanisms. The review identified common causes of emotional fatigue, such as prolonged exposure to high-stress environments, lack of social support, and insufficient recovery time. Consequences include decreased job performance, increased absenteeism, and a higher risk of mental health disorders. Coping strategies include mindfulness practices, organizational support, and the implementation of work-life balance interventions. The findings underscore the importance of addressing emotional fatigue through both individual and systemic approaches. While coping strategies can mitigate some effects, organizational changes are essential to create a supportive work environment. Emotional fatigue is a critical issue that requires attention at both the individual and organizational levels.",Enfermeria clinica,2025,Sara Gonçalves; Rita S Matos
40562191,Toxicology and safety pharmacology investigations on the nervous system: 2024 industry survey.,"The American College of Toxicology (ACT), the Safety Pharmacology Society (SPS) and the Society for Toxicological Pathology (STP) conducted an industry survey in 2024 to assess current industry practices as they relate to neurotoxicity and safety testing of therapeutics. This survey was developed as a follow-up to 2015 survey conducted by the Safety Pharmacology Society (SPS) to identify industry practices as they relate to central, peripheral and autonomic nervous system ('CNS') drug safety testing. In the current survey, there were one hundred thirty (130) respondents from Asia (5 %), Europe (32 %) and North America (64 %). Most respondents (54 %) were from pharmaceutical companies of over 1000 employees. Small molecules (89 %), large molecules (73 %), gene therapy (52 %), cell therapy (41 %) and vaccines (38 %) were the types of modalities developed by respondents. Oncology (72 %) and neurology/psychiatry (64 %) were the most frequent therapeutic indications pursued by companies followed by inflammation (56 %), cardiovascular (48 %), rare/orphan (44 %), metabolic (42 %), infectious (35 %) and respiratory (28 %) diseases. Tremors (81 %), emesis (75 %) and salivation (61 %) were more frequently reported than in the 2015 CNS survey while gait/coordination abnormalities (67 %), convulsion (65 %), and peripheral neuropathy (24 %) were unchanged or decreased when compared to the 2015 survey. Most respondents reported using a modified Irwin's test (90 %) added to toxicology studies (80 %) and/or as a standalone study (71 %), a major change from the 2015 survey where most respondents reported using a standalone study. Survey results reflect an industry shift towards the development of new therapies classified as biologics, cell and gene therapies.",Journal of pharmacological and toxicological methods,2025,Simon Authier; Marcus S Delatte; Alison Wakeford; Wendy Halpern; Owen McMaster; Dan Mellon; Deepa B Rao; Martin Traebert; Jean-Pierre Valentin; Katie Sokolowski; Michael K Pugsley
40562121,Impact of 7-ketocholesterol on the function and stability of the LAT1 transporter.,"The L-type amino acid transporter (LAT1, SLC7A5) is involved in supplying essential amino acids for brain and fetal development. The regulation of LAT1 function and stability by cholesterol was previously described in ex vivo and in vitro experimental models. The complexity of the relationship between LAT1 and cholesterol has been further studied by investigating the impact of selected oxidized forms of cholesterol, focusing on the most abundant auto-oxidized form of cholesterol, namely 7-ketocholesterol, which increases with age and pathologies characterized by high reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The partial substitution of cholesterol with 7-ketocholesterol in HEK293 cells transiently overexpressing the human LAT1 (HEK293-LAT1), decreases the Vmax of LAT1 mediated transport and the thermal stability of the protein. The impairing effect on transport was directly tested in LAT1 reconstituted proteoliposomes supplemented with 7-ketocholesterol. In this experimental model, it was found that the presence of 7-ketocholesterol altered the transport stimulation by adenosine triphosphate (ATP), as previously described. This was likely due to the higher rigidity of 7-ketocholesterol compared to cholesterol, which alters the membrane/protein interaction, weakening the ATP binding to LAT1. LAT1 transport function was also inhibited when proteoliposomes were supplemented with 7α-hydroxycholesterol or 25-hydroxycholesterol. These deleterious effects may be relevant in chronic pathological conditions characterized by altered cholesterol/oxysterol ratios, ranging from metabolic syndrome to kidney disease and neurological disorders.",Biochemical pharmacology,2025,Raffaella Scanga; Mariafrancesca Scalise; Fangrui Xiu; Michele Galluccio; Lara Console; Michele Visentin; Cesare Indiveri
40562107,"Network analysis of intergenerational associations: Parental childhood trauma, depression, anxiety, and adolescent maladaptive traits in depressed youth.","Adolescent depression, comorbid with maladaptive traits, increases the risks of suicide and psychosocial dysfunction, yet intergenerational pathways linking parental childhood trauma, depression, anxiety, and adolescent maladaptive traits remain complex and unclear. This study aimed to use network analysis to investigate these transmission mechanisms in clinically depressed adolescents. This study recruited 138 parent-adolescent pairs (M<sub>age</sub> = 15.92, SD = 1.84 for adolescents; M<sub>age</sub> = 43.65, SD = 5.37 for parents) to complete the assessment. Network analysis was applied to explore the associations between parental trauma, psychopathology, and adolescent maladaptive traits. The results showed that: (1) parental childhood trauma subtypes were linked to adolescent maladaptive traits through parental depression/anxiety; (2) physical abuse and emotional neglect exhibited the highest strength centrality among parental traumas, while impulsive-need for stimulation was the most central maladaptive trait in adolescents; (3) parental depression and anxiety emerged as bridge symptoms, connecting the transmission from parental trauma to adolescent maladaptation. Cross-sectional design limits causal inferences. These results indicated that parental psychopathology mediated intergenerational transmission, with parental physical abuse, emotional neglect and adolescent impulsivity serving as network hubs. By identifying bridge symptoms and central traits, this study provides actionable targets for breaking intergenerational dysfunction, emphasizing that clinical interventions targeting parental depression/anxiety may more effectively disrupt transmission cycles than adolescent-focused therapies.",Journal of affective disorders,2025,Nan Guo; Aiqun Yang; Ye Xu; Qi Liu; Chuanshi Su; Daxing Wu
40562062,Mental state and health-related quality of life in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome under metformin therapy - a prospective study.,"PCOS is one of the most prevalent endocrine disorders among women of reproductive age, often involving obesity, insulin resistance, and mental health challenges that reduce health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Although metformin has been shown to improve HRQOL in PCOS patients, it is unclear whether this effect is due to the drug itself or its metabolic benefits. This study included 66 PCOS patients from the University Medical Center Mainz, in two groups: 31 received metformin (M-group) and 35 received alternative or no treatment (C-group). HRQOL and distress were assessed at baseline and after 6 months using the Modified PCOS-Questionnaire (MPCOSQ) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). At baseline, the M-group had significantly worse metabolic markers, including HOMA-IR, waist circumference, Visceral Adiposity Index, and Fatty Liver Index. By follow-up, this group showed greater improvements in these markers. However, both groups improved similarly in HRQOL and distress. Regression analysis revealed that improvements in HOMA-IR and BMI were associated with better HRQOL scores. Group assignment was not a significant predictor. These findings may indicate that improvements in HRQOL and reduced distress are linked to metabolic changes associated with metformin use, underscoring the potential relevance of addressing metabolic health in treatment approaches.",Journal of psychosomatic obstetrics and gynaecology,2025,Konstantin Hofmann; Susanne Singer; Susanne Theis; Anna Dionysopoulou; Lina Schiestl; Yaman Degirmenci; Annette Hasenburg; Roxana Schwab; Christine Skala

40562057,[Basic knowledge of drug pain therapy in the palliative situation].,"This review provides an overview of the basic knowledge of drug pain therapy in the palliative situation. Pain is one of the main symptoms in 60 to 90% of cancer patients. Pain also develops with neurological and other diseases that occur in end-of-life situations. To address this symptom, a holistic strategy is required that encompasses all physical, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects of the multi-dimensional pain experience (""total pain"" concept).Drug treatment for cancer pain has been based on a stepwise approach for many years, starting with non-opioid analgesics, followed by moderate and strong opioids. In contrast, today's pain management is determined more by the actual intensity of this aversive event.The pain assessment should be tailored to identify a nociceptive vs. a neuropathic pain component that needs to be challenged by the most appropriate drug therapies. Non-opioid analgesics are ideal substances for relieving nociceptive pain. Antidepressants and anticonvulsants reduce the intensity of new neuropathic pain. Opioids are suitable for all types of pain, but are restricted to a second-line choice. Among all opioids are Tilidine and Tramadol prodrugs, which only relieve pain after activation in the liver. Drug-drug interactions may also block this activation. Rapid release opioids should be used for break-through cancer pain. Transdermal opioid applications are recommended in case of swallowing disorders, but usually not to initiate pain control. An opioid change can be performed if side effects such as hallucinations for the selected opioid are more pronounced than the pain reduction.",Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),2025,Sascha Weber; Angelika Lampert; Julia C Stingl; Vera Peuckmann-Post; Sonja Hiddemann; Frank Elsner; Irene Neuner; Roman Rolke
40562008,"Diagnostic Delays Are Common, and Classic Presentations Are Rare in Spinal Epidural Abscess.","Spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is a rare surgical emergency of the spine that can result in permanent neurological injury if not diagnosed and treated in a timely manner. Because early presentation can appear similar to benign back or neck pain, delays in diagnosis may be relatively common. We sought an improved understanding of the characteristics associated with SEA and frequency of delays in SEA diagnosis. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients with new magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed SEA from January 1, 2016-December 31, 2019 in an integrated healthcare system. We applied electronic data abstraction and focused manual chart review to describe potentially SEA-related ambulatory and emergency visits in the 30 days prior to SEA diagnosis, and patient characteristics including comorbidities, potential risk factors, and presenting signs and symptoms. We described the frequency of potential delays in diagnosis and of previously described clinical characteristics and risk factors for SEA. Spinal epidural abscess was diagnosed in 457 patients during the study period, 178 (39%) of whom were female, with median age 63 years (interquartile range 45-81 years). More than two-thirds of patients had at least one visit prior to diagnosis (323, 71%), and SEA location was most commonly the lumbar spine (235, 51%). Although over 90% of patients presented with back or neck pain or tenderness, the classic triad of back pain, fever, and neurologic symptoms was present in only 10% of patients. Diabetes mellitus and infection in the prior 90 days were common, while injection drug use, chronic steroid use, HIV infection, and solid organ transplant were rare. In an integrated healthcare system, 71% of patients with spinal epidural abscess had potentially related ambulatory care or emergency visits in the 30 days prior to diagnosis. Diagnosis of SEA remains challenging, with multiple visits common before the diagnosis is clear.",The western journal of emergency medicine,2025,Edward J Durant; Sarabeth Copos; Bruce F Folck; Meredith Anderson; Meena S Ghiya; Erik R Hofmann; Peter Vuong; Judy Shan; Mamata Kene
40562002,Effects of Emergency Department Training on Buprenorphine Prescribing and Opioid Use Disorder-Associated ED Revisits: Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Prescribing patients buprenorphine from the emergency department (ED) is recommended by multiple organizations. However, it is unclear how best to encourage physicians to prescribe buprenorphine from the ED. Our objectives in this study were to examine the effects of a departmental-wide training initiative for emergency physicians to prescribe buprenorphine, increase buprenorphine prescribing, and decrease ED re-utilization for opioid use disorder (OUD) complications. We performed this retrospective cohort study at an academic medical center. Beginning May 1, 2018, the ED started a buprenorphine-education initiative and tracked the proportion of clinicians who obtained buprenorphine-prescribing certification over the following 16 months. We identified adult patients referred to an addiction clinic from the ED during this period. Our primary outcome was the proportion of patients who received a buprenorphine prescription from the ED. Secondary outcomes included ED re-utilization for OUD complications and buprenorphine refills, as well as follow-up in the bridge clinic within 30 days. The proportion of physicians eligible to prescribe buprenorphine increased from 37% to 88% over the study period, and 430 patients were referred to an addiction clinic. The proportion of patients referred to a bridge program who received a buprenorphine prescription increased from 50% during the first month compared to 92% during month 16 (odds ratio 1.14, 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.21 per month). There were no statistically significant changes in any secondary outcomes. Our intervention increased buprenorphine prescribing by emergency physicians.

40562000,Dispatch Decisions and Emergency Medical Services Response in the Prehospital Care of Status Epilepticus.,"Emergency medical dispatch is intended to ensure that emergency medical services (EMS) allocate appropriate resources for the treatment of patients with status epilepticus (SE). However, it is unclear whether dispatch algorithms accurately identify those patients having a seizure-related medical emergency and how dispatch algorithms influence what prehospital resources are allocated for the encounter. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of prehospital encounters for SE using data from the 2019 ESO Data Collaborative. We included patients who were ≥18 years of age, had an EMS diagnostic impression of SE, and did not have a cardiac arrest. We examined the dispatch-determined complaint designated by the emergency medical dispatch (EMD) code, dispatch-determined level of acuity (A, B, C, D), ambulance response, and training level of the responding prehospital professional. Of the 18,515 patient encounters for SE with an EMD code, 8,279 (44.9%) were women, and the mean age was 40.0 years (SD 19.7). There were 13,829 (75%) encounters that received a dispatch code for seizures/convulsions and 4,686 (25%) with a dispatch code for a non-seizure-related condition. Among encounters for SE identified by dispatch as seizures/convulsions, 6,412 (46.4%) were designated high acuity, 6,626 (63.6%) were designated low acuity, and the majority received emergent ambulance responses (98.1% among those designated high acuity and 81.8% among those designated low acuity) and an Advanced Life Support-trained responder (93.7% among those designated high acuity and 92.7% among those designated low acuity). Median response times were similar for all acuity levels (9.1, 8.8, 9.1, and 8.3 minutes for A-D, respectively). Approximately one-fourth of SE cases were categorized as a non-seizure related condition at dispatch, and fewer than half received the highest acuity determinant code. Despite this, dispatch-assigned acuity did not have a strong relationship with the ambulance response or training level of the EMS responder or response time, suggesting that use of dispatch algorithms might be further optimized and highlighting a potential area to improve quality of EMS care.",The western journal of emergency medicine,2025,Robert P McInnis; Andrew J Wood; Courtney L Shay; Anna A Haggart; Remle P Crowe; Elan L Guterman
40561989,"""Oh, Another Overdose, for the Love of Pete"": First Responder Perspectives on Overdose Response Technology.","Overdose response applications and hotlines are novel overdose response technologies (ORT)/virtual harm reduction strategies that have recently emerged as a strategy to reduce the harms associated with the ongoing opioid epidemic. First responders are often the first point of contact for people who have overdosed and play a significant role in responses enacted by these services. In this study our aim was to explore the attitudes and perceptions of first responders on these novel technologies. We recruited 17 participants using purposive sampling through the province of Alberta between February-April 2023 including 11 paramedics, two firefighters, and five emergency communications operators. To be included in the study, participants were required to be older than 18 years of age, have the ability to communicate effectively in English, provide verbal informed consent, and work in an emergency responder role. Semi-structured interviews were conducted by two evaluators. When reviewing interview transcripts we used thematic analysis to identify key themes and subthemes. Participants discussed their current operating procedures, their current perspectives on overdose response hotlines and apps, how they would best integrate them into their current workloads, and how to raise awareness of these services within first-responder communities. Participants were apprehensive about the integration of these services into their current workloads, including their potential benefits, and raised concerns about their efficacy within communities of people who use drugs. Key strategies were raised for the successful integration of these services into emergency responses including providing information to clients and the feasibility of overdose responses by the general public. This study's results add to the existing literature on the toll of the overdose epidemic seen within first-response communities. Furthermore, we explored the communities' diverse perspectives on these novel technologies, including support and concerns, and propose additional strategies for their integration into emergency responses.",The western journal of emergency medicine,2025,William Rioux; Stephanie Jones; S Monty Ghosh
40561986,Practical Status and Social Background of Current Mobile Stroke Units Worldwide: A Survey and Investigation.,"We aimed to clarify the current challenges involved in introducing and operating mobile stroke units (MSU) in new regions, considering the social background of regions with MSUs. We conducted a questionnaire survey on the operational and financial status of all active MSU programs worldwide as of March 2023, and investigated the demographic, economic, and healthcare backgrounds of areas with and without active MSUs. We compared the data for the two groups at the country, state, or city level. We then correlated data gathered from the survey and the investigation. Of the 33 MSU programs contacted, 19 (59%) responded. The responding programs treated a range of 52-1,663 (median 781) patients at an MSU per year. The most commonly reported hours of operation were eight hours every weekday (5, 26%). The majority had four staff on board (11, 58%). No physicians were on board in six MSUs (32%). The catchment area radius ranged from 5-250 (median 22) kilometers. The start-up costs and subsequent annual operation costs of an MSU ranged from $0.7-1.8 million (median 1.0) and $0.7-1.7 (median 1.0) million US dollars, respectively. Reimbursement was obtained by eight (47%), with full reimbursement by two (12%). A negative gross financial balance was reported in eight MSUs (53%, of 15), and a financial challenge was reported in 17 (94%, of 18). Compared to the non-MSU group at the country level, active MSU groups had a significantly higher population, nominal gross domestic product, healthcare access and quality index, and physician density. They also had significantly lower age-standardized stroke incidence rates and age-standardized stroke disability-adjusted life year rate. The MSU operation time was significantly positively correlated with age-standardized stroke incidence rate and negatively with physician density. Despite facing serious financial problems, mobile stroke units currently operate around the world. However, the social context of MSUs appears relatively advanced. For future implementation of MSUs, cost-saving strategies and reimbursements should be addressed, and national or regional social backgrounds should be considered.",The western journal of emergency medicine,2025,Masahiko Hiroki; Mototsugu Kohno; Yutaka Kohno; Masaki Misawa
40561983,Exposure to Community Violence and Adverse Childhood Experiences in the Emergency Department.,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and exposure to community violence are public health issues linked to negative mental and physical health outcomes. The emergency department (ED) can play a critical role in the care of patients with a history of trauma exposure. Unfortunately, patients' experiences often go unidentified, leading to missed opportunities to address and prevent further harm. We administered a 22-question survey of trauma exposure in ED patients to 1) identify the prevalence of exposure to community violence and ACEs and resulting post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and 2) determine perceived social service needs. This self-administered survey study was conducted on a convenience sample of 267 adult patients at one academic hospital in Chicago, IL, between July 2018-December 2019. This ED sees approximately 70,000 patients annually. These were fluent English-speaking patients who were non-critically ill or altered and chosen randomly after being assigned to an ED room, typically during regular business hours based on research associate availability. They were not offered compensation for study participation. The survey included demographic information and questions modified from the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study questionnaire, the 54-item Survey of Exposure to Community Violence, and the Primary Care PTSD screen. Participants were also asked to identify resources to address their exposure to trauma. Of 268 surveys, 267 were completed; 88% of participants endorsed exposure to ACEs or community violence (95% confidence interval [CI] 84.1-91.9%, p < 0.001 compared to general US population rate of 61%). A total of 53.6% of respondents endorsed exposure to at least one ACE (95% CI, 47.6-59.6%), and 15.7% were exposed to ≥4 ACE (95% CI, 11.3-20.1%). The most commonly endorsed categories of ACE were ""emotional neglect"" (30.3%, 95% CI 24.8%-35.8%); ""emotional abuse"" (25.8%, 95% CI 20.6%-31.1%); and ""exposure to family substance use"" (21%, 95% CI 16.1%-25.9%). When asked about personal experience with violence in the community, 47.9% said they had been shoved, kicked or punched (95% CI 41.9%-53.9%), 8% had been stabbed (95% CI 4.8%-11.3%), and 6.7% had been shot (95% CI 3.7%-9.7%). Among the survey participants, 26.2% said they had seen someone die from violence either in their home or in their neighborhood (95% CI 20.9%-31.5%). ZIP Code analysis indicates that most patients resided in neighborhoods near our ED and were likely to utilize it for medical care. Of respondents with exposure to trauma 38% asked for resources through their primary care clinic (95% CI 32.2%-43.8%), while 77.4% asked for resources through faith-based organizations (95% CI 72.4%-82.4%). These findings suggest that most respondents in the ED have experienced trauma, and many are interested in community and clinical resources. These results demonstrate the need for trauma-informed screening in the ED and support for institutional and community-level interventions to address patient experiences.",The western journal of emergency medicine,2025,Leslie Cachola; Yanina Guevara; Sobia Ansari
40561979,Post-Concussion Syndrome Following Blast Injury: A Cross-Sectional Study of Beirut Blast Casualties.,"The massive 2020 blast in Beirut, Lebanon, caused by improperly stored ammonium nitrate, was one of the most powerful non-nuclear explosions in history, Following the blast, head injuries emerged as a predominant presentation to the emergency department (ED). Blast-induced head injuries can lead to mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) mediated via primary blast overpressure without direct head trauma. The recovery process from mTBIs can be prolonged and affected by several factors. If symptoms persist for more than three months, patients should be evaluated for post-concussion syndrome (PCS). While clinical blast-injury studies have focused on repetitive blast exposure, this study evaluates a cohort exposed to a single blast. We hypothesized that a single blast exposure is sufficient to induce PCS symptoms similar to those exposed to repetitive blasts. This cross-sectional study explores PCS in patients presenting to the ED of a tertiary-care center following the Beirut blast. Patients were identified through medical charts, contacted by phone, and consented to participate at least three months post-blast (beginning in November 2020). We used the Rivermead Post-Concussion Questionnaire (RPQ) to assess for PCS. We analyzed the association of PCS with patients and injury characteristics. Of 370 patients presenting to the ED, 145 (58.5%) completed the study questionnaire. Mean age was 39.8 ± 15.4 years, and 40% were females. Head trauma (46.9%) was the most common presentation. A total of 112 patients (77.2%) met the criteria for PCS, with a median RPQ score of 25 (interquartile range 18.75). After adjusting for injury types and distance from the blast, younger patients (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.972, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.947-0.998) and females (aOR 2.836, 95% CI 1.114-7.220) were more likely to suffer from PCS. Our study revealed a remarkably high prevalence of PCS among survivors of the Beirut blast, with younger individuals and females disproportionately affected. This highlights the need for age- and sex-specific rehabilitation and support programs. However, the study was limited by incomplete patients records and contact information, leading to the exclusion of a significant number of patients who initially presented to the ED. Ultimately, this study underscores the crucial role of robust public health preparedness and specialized care pathways against future large-scale catastrophes. Further assessment, including neurobiomarker evaluation, will be conducted on these survivors.",The western journal of emergency medicine,2025,Hind Anan; Moustafa Al Hariri; Eveline Hitti; Firas Kobeissy; Afif Mufarrij
40561962,"Epidemiology of 911 Calls for Opioid Overdose in Nogales, Arizona.","Drug overdose is the leading cause of unintentional death in the United States, and individuals identifying as BIPOC (Black, indigenous and people of color) and those of low socioeconomic status are over-represented in this statistic. The US-Mexico border faces several unique challenges when it comes to healthcare and the drug overdose crisis, due in large part to health inequities. Although the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that overdose prevention programs address health inequities, little is known about opioid overdoses in this rural, primarily Spanish-speaking region. As emergency medical services (EMS) records collect countywide data, they represent a high-quality source for epidemiologic surveillance. We conducted a retrospective chart review based on a local quality assurance program in which two years of EMS records were reviewed with the primary objective of characterizing patients receiving prehospital care for opioid overdoses in a rural, borderland community, and the secondary objective of characterizing EMS's fidelity to a naloxone distribution protocol. We included electronic patient care records for analysis if they included the EMS clinician's impression of overdose, opiate abuse, or opiate-related disorder from November 1, 2020-October 31,2022. The following data points were abstracted: date; patient initials/gender/age; police presence; response location; bystanders on scene; naloxone administration prior to EMS arrival; distribution of naloxone kit (yes/no); substance reported; and disposition. We analyzed descriptive statistics. A total of 74 cases met inclusion criteria over two years with the majority of cases involving men (82%) with a median age of 28. Almost half of overdoses occurred at private residences (46%), and slightly more than half (57%) reported fentanyl use prior to overdose. Family or friends were usually (64%) on scene, and law enforcement was often (77%) the first 911 to arrive. Naloxone was administered on scene in almost all cases (91%), usually by EMS (44%) or law enforcement (43%). The EMS clinicians distributed naloxone kits at 61% of calls. Opioid overdoses along the US-Mexico border occurred primarily among young men using illicit fentanyl in private residences. Although family/friends were often present, they rarely administered naloxone. Law enforcement was often the first 911 responder to arrive. Emergency medical services is a suitable setting for naloxone distribution programs.",The western journal of emergency medicine,2025,Melody Glenn; Darien Stratton; Keith Primeau; Amber Rice

This study investigates the interaction of sex, body mass index (BMI) and mental on age-related changes in sleep architecture, measured with ORP in community-dwelling adults using at-home polysomnography (PSG). We measured sleep architecture using ORP in 195 middle-aged to older (>50 years) sedentary but healthy adults and a younger cohort (<35 years, n = 34). All sleep nights utilized MY scoring (Cerebra Medical, Winnipeg Manitoba) to calculate traditional sleep architecture values, average ORP in different sleep stages and percent of time in different ORP deciles. Differences between groups were assessed using ANOVA models. Mental health was assessed using standardized questionnaires linear regression models were used to report the relationship between age and sleep architecture, ORP, and interactions between sex, BMI, anxiety and depression. Significant interactions were present for body mass index, deep sleep deciles, and the awake stage. Confirming previous findings, we report reduced deep sleep, increased light sleep and more full wakefulness in middle-aged to older adults, consistent with decreased sleep pressure with aging.

40561800,Prevalence of somatic symptom and related disorders at a tertiary neuroimmunology clinic.,"The prevalence of somatic symptom and related disorders (SSRDs) in the neuroimmunology clinic is unknown. To evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of SSRDs in patients referred to a tertiary neuroimmunology clinic. We retrospectively evaluated the presence of SSRDs in patients referred to a tertiary neuroimmunology clinic from 2016 to 2023. 898 patients were referred; 204 (22.7 %) did not have a neuroimmunological disorder. Fifty-four patients (6.0 % of total; 26.5 % of non-neuroimmunological) were diagnosed with SSRDs (74 % females, average age 42.5, SD 10.9). Per the DSM5-TR criteria, the following categories were identified: functional neurological disorder (25 patients, 46.3 %), somatic symptom disorder (22 patients, 40.7 %), SSRD unspecified (4 patients, 7.4 %), and illness anxiety disorder (3 patients, 5.5 %). Forty-three patients (79.6 %) were referred for MS, and 10 (18.5 %) for autoimmune encephalitis. Twenty-two patients (40.7 %) were referred by general neurologists, 16 (29.6 %) were self-referrals, 12 (22.2 %) were referred by their primary care physicians, and 4 (7.4 %) were referred by other specialists. Eleven patients (20.4 %) were healthcare workers. Compared to MS patients evaluated at the same timeframe, SSRD patients were older, more likely to be white, and less likely to be black.

40561790,"Cannabis use, risk of cannabis use disorder, and anxiety and depression among bisexual patients: A comparative study of sex and sexual identity differences in a large health system.","This study used electronic health record (EHR) data from 9869 sexual minority patients aged 18 and older who had a primary care visit within a Los Angeles university health system (June 2020-May 2023). Sexual minority patients, defined as lesbian, gay, or bisexual, were screened for cannabis use and risk of cannabis use disorder (CUD) during annual wellness visits. Mental health diagnoses were extracted from patients' EHR. Multivariable regression models were used to assess associations between sexual identity, sex, and cannabis-related outcomes, including cannabis use, risk of CUD, mental health diagnoses among individuals reporting cannabis use, and cannabis use for symptom management among those with a corresponding diagnosis. All models controlled for age and race/ethnicity. Bisexual patients had higher adjusted odds of cannabis use compared to gay/lesbian patients (AOR females: 1.67; males: 1.47). Bisexual males had greater odds of risk of CUD (AOR: 1.48) and depression diagnosis (AOR:1.86) compared to gay males. Bisexual males with a diagnosis for depression had higher odds of cannabis use for managing depression or sadness symptoms (AOR: 2.44) compared to gay males. Bisexual females had higher odds of a severe stress diagnosis compared to gay/lesbian females (AOR: 2.44). These findings emphasize the importance of developing targeted primary care approaches that address both cannabis use and mental health concerns among bisexual patients. While the prevalence of cannabis use is higher among sexual minorities as compared to their heterosexual counterparts, few studies have examined the differences in cannabis use across sex and sexual identity among sexual minority individuals, especially in the context of health care. This study examines the association of sexual identity and sex with cannabis use, risk of cannabis use disorder (CUD), symptoms managed with cannabis use, and mental health diagnoses among sexual minority primary care patients. We conducted a cross-sectional study using electronic health record (EHR) data from 9869 patients ≥ 18 years of age who identified as sexual minority, defined as lesbian, gay, or bisexual, and had a primary care visit between June 2020 and May 2023 within a university-based health system in Los Angeles, CA. Routine screening for past 3-month cannabis use and risk of CUD was based on the Alcohol Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) and was conducted as part of all annual wellness visits. Patients were asked to report symptoms for which they used cannabis, and mental health diagnoses were extracted from patients' EHR. Diagnoses meeting clinical threshold criteria were identified based on the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes and included anxiety disorders (ICD-10 F41), depressive disorders (ICD-10 F33), and severe stress (ICD-10 F43). Differences in the prevalence of cannabis use by sociodemographic characteristics were stratified by sex and compared across sexual identity using chi-squared tests for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for continuous variables. Multivariable regression models were used to assess associations between sexual identity, sex, and cannabis-related outcomes, including cannabis use in the past 3 months, risk of CUD, mental health diagnoses among individuals reporting cannabis use, and cannabis use for symptom management among those with a corresponding diagnosis. All models controlled for age and race/ethnicity. Among the 9869 patients included in this study, 30.7 % reported cannabis use in the past 3 months. Bisexual patients had higher adjusted odds of cannabis use in comparison to gay/lesbian patients in both females and males (female adjusted odds ratio (AOR):1.67; 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) 1.46, 1.92; male AOR: 1.47; 95 % CI 1.24, 1.73). Among males reporting cannabis use, bisexual individuals had greater odds of risk of CUD (AOR: 1.48; 95 % CI: 1.14, 1.93) and depression diagnosis (AOR: 1.86; 95 % CI: 1.34, 2.56) compared to gay males. Bisexual males with a diagnosis for depression had higher odds of cannabis use for managing depression or sadness symptoms (AOR: 2.44; 95 % CI: 1.34, 4.52) compared to gay males. Among females reporting cannabis use, bisexual patients had higher odds of a severe stress diagnosis compared to gay/lesbian females (AOR: 2.44; 95 % CI: 1.45, 4.35). These findings highlight the need for primary care providers to consider the unique experiences of bisexual patients, particularly regarding mental health and cannabis use. Increased odds of cannabis use among bisexual patients, coupled with their higher odds of mental health disorders, reinforces the importance of integrating mental health support and addressing cannabis use in routine healthcare.",Drug and alcohol dependence,2025,Naira Setrakian; Lillian Gelberg; Julia Koerber; Un Young Chung; Whitney N Akabike; Pamina M Gorbach; Marissa J Seamans; Steven Shoptaw; Alison Cerezo; Marjan Javanbakht
40561726,"Perspectives on psychotherapy in Southeast Asia: Insights from psychiatrists and trainees (Part I: Attitudes, current practices and training preferences).","Psychotherapy is an evidence-based treatment for mental disorders. Despite its global development, neuroscientific advances, and measurable efficacy, attitudes toward psychotherapy in Southeast Asia (SEA) remain underexplored, particularly among psychiatrists and psychiatric trainees. This study aimed to assess attitudes toward psychotherapy, its current use in clinical practice, and stated preferences for future training among psychiatrists and trainees in SEA. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted across Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. The questionnaire explored perspectives on psychotherapy and its integration into practice. Data were analyzed descriptively and comparatively. Of 253 respondents, 149 (58.9 %) were psychiatrists and 104 (41.1 %) were psychiatric trainees. Both groups exhibited positive attitudes toward psychotherapy, recognizing its professional value, clinical efficacy, and integration with pharmacotherapy. Combination therapy was frequently used; pharmacotherapy dominated for severe disorders, psychotherapy for adjustment and personality disorders, and ECT primarily for schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder. Commonly used therapies include cognitive behavioral therapy, supportive psychotherapy, and mindfulness-based approaches. Psychiatrists favored expanding the number of psychotherapists, while trainees expressed stronger interest in advanced psychodynamic techniques and psychoanalysis. Both groups advocated for additional training in evidence-based psychotherapies and foundational clinical skills. Psychiatrists and trainees in SEA value psychotherapy and its relevance to both clinical practice and everyday life. There is a general preference for integrating psychotherapy with psychopharmacological treatment. Future efforts should focus on enhancing psychotherapy training, addressing cultural adaptations, and overcoming systemic challenges to improve access and efficacy of interventions in SEA.",Asian journal of psychiatry,2025,Warut Aunjitsakul; Kanthee Anantapong; Nisan Werachattawan; Kreuwan Jongbovonwiwat; Rasmon Kalayasiri; Daruj Aniwattanapong; Poom Chompoosri; Andre Tay Teck Sng; Samuel Cheng Eng Teck; Sanjiv Nair Sasidharan; David Choon Liang Teo; Petrin Redayani Lukman; Sylvia Detri Elvira; Alfi Fajar Almasyhur; Nik Ruzyanei Nik Jaafar; Farah Nabila; Jiann Lin Loo; Nuur Asyikin Binti Mohd Shukor; Eric Bui; Vu Tuong Vi; Anh Ngoc Tran; Tan Nguyen; Tien Nguyen; Timothy B Sullivan; César A Alfonso
40561721,Frontal alpha asymmetry in major depression and comorbid anxiety disorder: a five-year follow-up study.,"Major depression (MD) and anxiety disorders are both associated with higher left compared to right frontal alpha activity (rLFα). The aim of the study was to examine whether young adults with lifetime MD and anxiety disorder differ from healthy controls and whether this pattern remains stable over five years from adolescence into adulthood. Resting frontal EEG asymmetry of n = 25 young adults with lifetime MD and anxiety (MDAnx) and n = 26 healthy controls (HC) was compared. Moreover, in a subsample of participants, the stability of frontal alpha asymmetry was analyzed from adolescence to young adulthood via intra-class-correlations. Participants with MDAnx displayed significantly more rLFα than HCs. Asymmetry showed fair stability over 5 years in the MDAnx group and poor stability in the HC group, the latter driven by increased relative right frontal alpha activity. Increased rLFα could be a trait marker for comorbid MDAnx. Low stability in the HC group could derive from maturation of cognitive and affective processes, which might be impeded by the presence of lifetime MDAnx. Results highlight that EEG asymmetry changes from adolescence to adulthood and could be impacted by lifetime MD and anxiety, irrespective of current symptomatology.",Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,2025,Carolin Zsigo; Ellen Greimel; Jürgen Bartling; Gerd Schulte-Körne; Lisa Feldmann
40561715,Trial-by-trial ERP-behavior relationships in psychosis: Between- and within-person variability in performance monitoring adjustments.,"Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, characterized by deficits in performance monitoring, predicts clinical and functional outcomes. The error-related negativity (ERN), a neurophysiological index of error detection, is reduced in psychosis, but it is unclear why this impaired error detection is not closely linked to behavioral adjustments. A possibility is that research has overrelied on examining between-person relationships of average ERN and behavior, rather than focusing on within-person, trial-by-trial changes. This study aimed to determine whether neurophysiological indices of error detection (ERN, error positivity [Pe]) predict within-person post-error behavioral adjustments in psychotic disorders and whether these relationships are weaker in people with psychosis than in controls. ERN and Pe were assessed during a flanker task in 72 participants with psychosis (PwP) and 82 healthy comparison participants. Multilevel location-scale models examined trial-by-trial changes in the relationships between event-related potentials (ERPs) and behavior (response [RTs], accuracy). Results showed that ERP-RT relationships were similar across PwP and controls. In both groups, greater within-person increases in ERN predicted longer and more variable RTs following correct trials. Larger within-person increases in Pe predicted shorter and more variable RTs following correct trials, but less variable RTs following error trials. Exploratory analyses in a subset of participants with schizophrenia showed similar effects. ERP-accuracy relationships were neither observed nor moderated by diagnostic group. Within-person ERP-behavior relationships were preserved in psychosis, indicating intact performance monitoring at the individual level. This supports performance monitoring as a transdiagnostic construct and underscores the importance of examining intraindividual variability to understand performance monitoring in psychotic disorders.",Schizophrenia research,2025,Bohyun Park; Amanda Holbrook; Philippe Rast; Gregory A Light; Dan Foti; Roman Kotov; Peter E Clayson
40561713,Sharing drug checking results in a Canadian setting: a multi-site analysis.,"Drug checking services (DCS) have been implemented as a harm reduction measure to address high rates of illicit drug morbidity and mortality. In addition to reducing individual-level risk, there is also potential for DCS users to increase community level awareness of drug market conditions through sharing of drug checking results. However, little is known about the patterns of information sharing among people who use DCS. Data were derived from a cross-sectional study conducted at 22 community harm reduction sites offering DCS across British Columbia (BC) between March 2021 and July 2024. Two variable selection methods - backwards stepwise selection and elastic net regularization - were used to fit models which explored the relationships between select socio-demographic characteristics, drug use patterns and experiences with drug checking with the main outcome measure: sharing drug checking results. 516 participants were included in the study (34 % women, median age 42); 274 (53 %) reported that they shared their drug checking results. Factors significantly and positively associated with sharing results in multivariable logistic regression analysis using both selection methods included: drug dealing, using DCS more than once, stable employment and white ethnicity. Among participants who reported they shared their drug checking results, 66 % reported sharing results with friends and family and 28 % reported sharing results with their drug dealer. This study revealed that over half the study sample shared their drug checking results with others, with results sharing being positively associated with recent drug dealing, frequent DCS utilisation, employment and ethnicity. Drug checking results were most often shared with friends, family and drug dealers. These findings extend the evidence base of DCS as a harm reduction tool by demonstrating how engagement with DCS facilitates information dissemination amongst drug market actors.",The International journal on drug policy,2025,Joshua Bird; Samuel Tobias; Cameron Grant; Mark Lysyshyn; Kenneth Tupper; Evan Wood; Thomas Kerr; Lianping Ti
40561651,Factors impacting military emergency medicine residents' sleep and barriers to seeking help: A sequential exploratory mixed-methods study.,"Emergency medicine (EM) resident physicians face unique challenges in adhering to the principles of sleep hygiene due to the nature of EM shift work. They are at higher risk for sleep disorders, sleep-related errors and accidents, and impaired performance due to constantly changing schedules. Military residents also perceive a stigma against seeking mental health care and taking sleeping medications. This mixed-methods study investigated sleep quality and barriers to seeking care among EM residents at a single center, three-year, Active-Duty military EM residency program. A survey was made available to all 36 EM residents assessing daytime sleepiness using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) with a target response rate of 66.7 %. The purpose of using the ESS was to identify at least 9 EM residents with excessive daytime sleepiness to participate in semi-structured interviews about their sleeping experiences. Excessive daytime sleepiness is defined as ≥11 on the ESS. These interviews were coded using a phenomenological approach to data analysis. Of the 36 EM residents in the program, 24 (66.7 %) completed the survey. Of these, 11 scored ≥11 on the ESS. Of these, nine EM residents participated in semi-structured interviews. Thematic saturation was achieved, and four themes emerged from interviews: 1) challenges with sleep hygiene; 2) less satisfied with sleep since starting residency; 3) normalization of poor sleep; and 4) taking medication for sleep is stigmatized. Results revealed significant difficulties adhering to the principles of sleep hygiene due to inconsistent sleep-wake times. Participants identified difficulty avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and large meals before bed, and felt their sleep had worsened since starting residency. Though residents often discussed sleep difficulties with colleagues, these conversations normalized sleeping problems and reduced help-seeking behavior. Participants perceived a stigma against using prescription medication for sleep. This study highlights significant sleep disturbances experienced by EM residents in this study and an inability to adhere to the principles of sleep hygiene. Normalization of sleep disturbances in residency seems to impede residents from seeking professional help. Further research should focus on targeted interventions to improve resident sleep hygiene, promote help-seeking behavior, and reduce the stigma associated with prescription drug use, when necessary. Additional studies are needed to examine the generalizability of these results to other training programs.",The American journal of emergency medicine,2025,Joshua J Oliver; David S Ediger; Jillian F Phelps; Ariel L Hoffman; Alexander W Martin; Sadie A Martin; Rachel E Bridwell; Simon D Aebersold; Rebekah Cole; Jeffrey C Ransom
40561635,The effect of eating disorders and trauma day treatment in women with eating disorders and childhood maltreatment history: A pilot study.,"'Women with eating disorders (EDs) and a history of childhood maltreatment (CM) tend to have more psychiatric comorbidities including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Complex PTSD (CPTSD) and a worse prognosis than women with EDs without CM. Yet research on treatment of comorbidity of EDs and PTSD/CPTSD symptoms due to CM is scarce. We assessed the effectiveness of a day program for women with EDs and CM history on symptoms of EDs, PTSD, CPTSD and dissociation. The 3 month, four-days-a-week program which operates in a single tertiary mental health center, provides weekly individual (psychiatric, psychotherapeutic, dietician, Eye Movement Desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)) and group therapies, and 2 daily observed meals for adult women diagnosed with EDs and CM history. Participants self-reported before treatment, (n = 53; T1), after treatment (n = 36; T2) and at six-month follow up (n = 22, T3) on EDs, CM, PTSD/CPTSD and dissociation. PTSD was also assessed via interview (CAPS-5). Significant improvement in measures of EDs, PTSD and CPTSD were observed, regardless of CM exposure.

40561556,The impact of depression on functioning: Relation to medication response and other predictors.,"Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide, profoundly impairing occupational, social, and family functioning. We aimed to identify socio-demographic and clinical variables associated with functional impairment across these domains in patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD), with a particular focus on treatment-resistant depression (TRD). 755 patients with MDD and treated with antidepressants for at least four weeks were included from the multicentric study of ""Group for the Study of Resistant Depression"". Depression severity was assessed using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (retrospective and current), while functional impairment was measured with the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Univariate and multivariate models adjusted for age, sex, and depression severity were used. Across all domains, higher depression severity, particularly marked by suicide risk, anhedonia, and inpatient status, was strongly linked to higher disability. In non-TRD patients, somatic comorbidities, including diabetes, were significant predictors of social and family functioning impairment, whereas in TRD patients, family-related factors such as a higher number of children and living alone were associated with impaired functioning. These findings underscore the heterogeneous determinants of disability in depression and suggest that tailored treatment approaches addressing both clinical severity and specific socio-demographic factors may improve functional outcomes.",Psychiatry research,2025,Ilenia White; Antonina Luca; Maria Luca; Lucie Bartova; Siegfried Kasper; Joseph Zohar; Daniel Souery; Stuart Montgomery; Panagiotis Ferentinos; Dan Rujescu; Julien Mendlewicz; Raffaella Zanardi; Raffaele Ferri; Giuseppe Lanza; Alessandro Rodolico; Maria Signorelli; Alessandro Serretti
40561552,The Perspective of Psychiatry and Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Residents About Psychotherapy Training in Portugal.,"Psychotherapy is an effective treatment for various mental disorders. Most recommendations advocate training in psychotherapy for psychiatry and child and adolescent psychiatry residents. However, incorporating psychotherapy training into the curricula of psychiatric residency programs has proven difficult. In Portugal, competence in psychotherapy is not mandatory to become a psychiatrist or a child and adolescent psychiatrist. Our study aims to describe the perspectives of psychiatry and child and adolescent psychiatry residents on psychotherapy training in Portugal. The authors developed a voluntary, anonymous, online self-reported questionnaire to be applied to psychiatry and child and adolescent psychiatry residents. Data was collected during 2023. The response rate was 29.9%. The main results were that most Portuguese psychiatry and child and adolescent psychiatry trainees stated that their institution did not provide psychotherapy training (95.2%) and were dissatisfied with the psychotherapy training provided by their residency centers (96.8%). All residents agreed that psychotherapy training involves a significant financial investment, and almost all (96.8%) believed it involved a substantial investment in terms of time in the long term. Likewise, most trainees (94.4%) considered psychotherapy training should be included within the residency work schedule. Crucially, psychiatry and child and adolescent psychiatry residents were interested in psychotherapy training (93.6%), and most regarded psychotherapy as a mandatory competence of the residency training program (85.7%). More than two-thirds (70.6%) of residents considered initiating or continuing psychotherapy training after residency. Regarding the modalities that should be included in the residency program, residents pointed out cognitive-behavioral therapy, family therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and support psychotherapy. About 40% of respondents mentioned they were in personal psychotherapy during the residency. Modifications in residency curricula should seriously be considered so that future psychiatrists can be qualified to provide effective psychotherapy treatment. The authors believe they provided relevant data pooled from future psychiatrists and child and adolescent psychiatrists which can be useful to help define training in a perceived essential competence.",Acta medica portuguesa,2025,Rui M Salgado; Orlando Von Doellinger

40561526,Radiofluorinated Analogs of NCS-382 as Potential PET Tracers for Imaging the CaMKIIα Hub Domain.,"The Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMKIIα) is a key regulator of calcium signaling in the central nervous system and is suggested to play a crucial role in neurodegenerative diseases and stroke. The CaMKIIα hub domain was recently identified as a high-affinity binding site for γ-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), representing a new target for neurological research and therapy. In this study, we synthesized and evaluated two novel radiofluorinated GHB analogs, [<sup>18</sup>F]<b>6</b> and [<sup>18</sup>F]<b>9</b>, to visualize CaMKIIα via this domain in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET). In vitro autoradiography demonstrated specific binding of [<sup>18</sup>F]<b>6</b> to CaMKIIα-rich brain regions, whereas [<sup>18</sup>F]<b>9</b> exhibited apparent nonspecific myelin binding. In vivo, [<sup>18</sup>F]<b>6</b> crossed the blood-brain barrier but did not exhibit effective PET imaging of CaMKIIα presumably due to a too low affinity. Despite this limitation, the brain penetrance of the compound suggests that further chemical modifications could enhance its suitability for neuroimaging.

40561477,Exploring the neural mechanisms of ADHD in children: a multifeature cross-task fNIRS analysis.,"Children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder exhibit multidimensional abnormalities of brain function, and the identification of key brain regions is often inconsistent across studies due to the influence of specific cognitive demands and feature selection. We conducted multifeature cross-task analysis and correlation analysis of functional near-infrared spectroscopy-based functional activity and connectivity under both resting state and verbal fluency task. Results reveal that more pronounced brain activation differences were observed in the right hemisphere of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder group compared with healthy controls, particularly in channels 7 and 13, with cross-task consistent activation patterns. The strongest connectivity appeared between the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the right frontopolar cortex in both resting state and verbal fluency task. Meanwhile, the task-related significant differences were mainly found in the left hemisphere, with fewer connectivity differences between tasks than between groups. Furthermore, a complex nonlinear relationship was identified between brain activation intensity and functional connectivity in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, a negative correlation in resting state, and a positive correlation in half of the brain regions (including bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) during verbal fluency task. These findings support the existing attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder mechanisms and supplement the complexity of cross-task brain functional reorganization and fixed functional abnormalities, thereby advancing research on the neurobiological basis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.","Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",2025,Mengxiang Chu; Jiaojiao Ren; Lijuan Yang; Yunxiang Ma; Zhengyu Zhong; Xiaowei He; Hongbo Guo; Xiao Li; Jingjing Yu; Zhaohui Wang
40561474,Foxg1 gene mutation impairs auditory cortex response and reduces sound tolerance.,"FOXG1 syndrome (FS) is a rare and devastating neurodevelopmental disorder affected by FOXG1 gene mutations and reduced sound tolerance has been reported in children with FS. Effects of single missense mutation of Foxg1 gene on auditory function and behavior were studied using the G216S mouse model. G216S mice showed significantly reduced gap-induced prepulse inhibition, suggesting poor temporal processing without hearing loss. Increased running and freezing behaviors under loud sounds were also found in G216 mice, suggesting aversive sound behaviors. Electrophysiological assessment of the auditory cortex of G216 mice revealed a slightly reduced amplitude and enlarged poststimulus responses to the sound stimulus. The layer function analysis using current source density revealed reduced layer-specific response in the G216S mice. Immunocytochemistry found Foxg1 gene mutation affects cortical layer differentiations and reduced cortical neurons, which are consistent with the physiological results. Our study suggests that the Foxg1 mutation impaired cortical development. The results are consistent with other models of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), suggesting that the G216S mouse model may represent a hyperacusis model of ASD. Our results provide direct evidence that a single-nucleotide mutation of the Foxg1 gene can affect cortical layer development and auditory processing and reduce sound tolerance.","Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",2025,Fei Xu; Guangdi Chen; Shin Jeon; Lynne Ling; Senthilvelan Manohar; Dalian Ding; Benjamin D Auerbach; Jae Lee; Soo-Kyung Lee; Wei Sun
40561473,Effectiveness of Information and Communication Technology-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Using the Smart Sleep App on Insomnia in Older Adults: Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Insomnia is a common sleep disorder, especially among older adults, with a significant impact on the quality of life (QoL) and is associated with various comorbidities. Traditional pharmacotherapy for insomnia is often unsuitable for older adults because of potential drug interactions and side effects, making nonpharmacological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) more appropriate. However, delivering CBT-I in a traditional face-to-face setting poses challenges including accessibility and adherence, particularly for older adults. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an information and communication technology (ICT)-based CBT-I program, ""Smart Sleep,"" specifically designed to improve insomnia among community-dwelling older persons. A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted with 59 older participants from Incheon, South Korea. Participants were divided into an intervention group, which used the Smart Sleep mobile app, and a control group. The intervention group received 8 weeks of non-face-to-face CBT-I through the app, which included sleep diaries, relaxation exercises, and real-time consultations. Outcomes were measured at baseline, week 4, and week 8, with a focus on insomnia severity, sleep quality, sleep efficiency, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, depression, and QoL. The intervention group showed significant improvements in insomnia severity, sleep quality, sleep efficiency, and dysfunctional beliefs about sleep compared to the control group. However, there was no significant difference in the QoL between the 2 groups (F<sub>2,114</sub>=0.998, P=.37). Participation rates in the Smart Sleep program were high, with a 94% completion rate for sleep diary tasks and 100% participation in real-time consultations. In addition, subgroup analysis based on sleep medication use showed significant improvements in insomnia severity for both medicated and nonmedicated participants. The ICT-based CBT-I program ""Smart Sleep"" effectively improved sleep-related outcomes among older participants, demonstrating the potential of non-face-to-face interventions in managing insomnia in this population. The program is user-friendly, and ICT-based coaching contributed to high engagement. To ensure broader access for older adults, distribution through community welfare or public health centers is recommended.

40561441,Novel Top Surgery in Small-Breasted Individuals with Gender Dysphoria: Periareolar Interlocking Suture and Waterjet-Assisted Liposuction.,"In small-breasted individuals with gender dysphoria (GD), the concentric periareolar approach is typically the preferred method for mastectomy. However, this method carries a notable risk of hypertrophic scars and changes in areolar dimensions. In this article, the authors introduce the periareolar interlocking suture (PIS) as a new scar-minimizing procedure with a low complication rate and high level of patient satisfaction. The corresponding author (A.W.) performed a concentric periareolar mastectomy combined with PIS and waterjet-assisted liposuction in patients with small breasts (A to B cup) and good skin quality and elasticity. Outcome measures included complication rates, patient satisfaction (based on the BODY-Q Chest and Nipples scales and scar appearance), nipple sensitivity, and rate of surgical corrections. Between April of 2017 and December of 2023, the corresponding author (A.W.) conducted 2312 mastectomies in 1156 individuals with GD, with 410 breasts treated using concentric periareolar mastectomy combined with PIS and waterjet-assisted liposuction. The mean patient age was 23 years; the mean hospital stay was 4 days; and the mean operative time was 96.1 minutes. The overall complication rate was 7.8%, with acute hematomas occurring in 4.6% of cases. Secondary revisions were necessary in 2.2% of cases. Patient satisfaction, measured using the BODY-Q scale, was statistically significant and very high. Individuals with GD are well informed and increasingly demand aesthetically pleasing outcomes. Whenever feasible, procedures with minimal scarring are preferred. The technique presented here resulted in a high level of patient satisfaction, preserved nipple sensitivity, and a low rate of complications and secondary aesthetic corrections in a carefully selected cohort of patients with small breasts.

40561419,Serum Autoantibody Titers and Neurofilament Light Chain Levels in CASPR2/LGI1 Encephalitis: A Longitudinal Study.,"Autoantibodies against contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2-IgG) and leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 protein (LGI1-IgG) identify a subgroup of autoimmune encephalitis (AE). Up to 65% of patients with LGI1/CASPR2 AE show cognitive sequelae that are unpredictable at onset. We aimed to assess the clinical relevance of serum autoantibody titers and neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels as biomarkers in CASPR2/LGI1 AE. We selected consecutive CASPR2/LGI1-IgG-positive patients with at least 2 longitudinal serum samples obtained more than 60 days apart. Samples were defined as acute (first diagnostic evaluation after onset or relapse and before immunotherapy) and remission (>2 months from attack). CASPR2/LGI1-IgG was titered with a live cell-based assay. Functional outcome was measured using modified Rankin Scale and Clinical Assessment Scale in AE and cognitive impairment using Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). We included 23 patients (LGI1 = 15, CASPR2 = 7, CASPR2/LGI1 = 1) with 130 serum samples (acute = 32; remission = 98). Serum titers in the acute phase were higher than in remission and decreased over time and after immunosuppressive treatment. In 9 of 10 patients, relapses occurred with seropositive samples, and in 4 of 5 patients, these occurred with increased titers. Onset titers did not correlate with functional/cognitive outcome at follow-up.Serum NfL median levels in both patients with LGI1 AE (35.3 pg/mL, range: 5.4-164) and CASPR2 AE (31.4 pg/mL, range: 9.11-120) were higher than in age/sex-matched controls (14.55, range: 5.4-56.8, <i>p</i> = 0.004 and <i>p</i> < 0.001, respectively). Acute-phase samples had higher NfL median levels (47.2, range: 9.11-120) compared with remission (31.2 pg/mL; range, 5.4-114, <i>p</i> = 0.02). NfL levels at onset predicted lower MoCA scores at follow-up in univariate linear regression analysis (B = -3.881, <i>p</i> = 0.0256). NfL levels decreased over time, but at the last follow-up remained higher than those in controls (<i>p</i> = 0.02). Measuring LGI1 and CASPR2-IgG titers in AE could help to confirm the disease stage and define relapses but has no prognostic implications. Serum NfL at onset could be used to identify patients at higher risk of cognitive sequelae that might deserve tailored management.",Neurology(R) neuroimmunology & neuroinflammation,2025,Pietro Businaro; Stefano Masciocchi; Ruggero Barnabei; Silvia Scaranzin; Chiara Morandi; Matteo Scucchi; Sara Bernini; Sara Bottiroli; Paolo Barone; Antonella Toriello; Carla Arbasino; Chiara Padiglioni; Silvia Cenciarelli; Luana Benedetti; Denise Cerne; Mario Risi; Matteo Paoletti; Anna Pichiecchio; Luca Diamanti; Paola Bini; Elisabetta Zardini; Diego Franciotta; Matteo Gastaldi
40561417,Impostor phenomenon and psychological outcomes among family medicine residents: a cross-sectional study in Croatia.,"The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine the prevalence of the impostor phenomenon among family medicine residents (FMRs) and its connection with sociodemographic factors and clinically relevant symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. During July 2023, 158 first-year FMRs were invited to fill out an anonymous online questionnaire containing sociodemographic data, history of psychiatric disorders, Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS), and the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21). Seventynine participants responded (50 % response rate) and 59 reported some level of impostor feelings. Clinically relevant symptoms of depression were reported by 17, anxiety by 23, and stress by 20 participants. All 59 participants whose responses indicated impostor feelings above normal also had higher scores for depression, anxiety, and stress (p<0.001 in Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test). Despite a small sample with uneven gender distribution and self-reported scales, our study found a significant association between the impostor phenomenon and negative mental outcomes. We believe that the impostor phenomenon among FMRs can be addressed effectively with interventions like peer support, mentoring, and practicing self-compassion if started early during medical study and specialisation.",Arhiv za higijenu rada i toksikologiju,2025,Sunčana Vlah Tomičević; Valerija Bralić Lang

40561381,Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Associations of Neighborhood Disadvantage With Fluid Biomarkers of Neuroinflammation and Neurodegeneration.,"Living in a socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhood has an adverse impact on health outcomes, including increased risk of Alzheimer disease (AD). The biological mechanisms underlying this risk are poorly understood. We sought to examine how neighborhood disadvantage relates to core AD pathology, neurodegeneration, and inflammatory biomarkers in community-dwelling older adults cross-sectionally and over time. Participants included older adults from the Vanderbilt Memory and Aging Project who underwent fasting blood and CSF acquisition serially over a 9-year follow-up period (mean follow-up = 6.4 years [blood] and 4.0 years [CSF]). Area Deprivation Index (ADI), representing neighborhood disadvantage, was quantified at baseline using 17 components (e.g., housing, income, education, and household characteristics), with higher values indicating greater disadvantage. Ordinary least-squares regressions cross-sectionally related ADI to plasma and CSF inflammatory biomarkers adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, modified Framingham Stroke Risk Profile score, <i>APOE</i> ε4 status, and cognitive status. Linear mixed-effects regression models related ADI to longitudinal biomarkers with identical covariates plus follow-up time. Outcomes included CSF chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), CSF soluble-triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2, CSF amyloid-β<sub>42</sub> (Aβ<sub>42</sub>), CSF Aβ<sub>40</sub>/Aβ<sub>42</sub> ratio, CSF tau, CSF phosphorylated tau (ptau), plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), and plasma and CSF neurofilament light chain. Participants (n = 334; 73 ± 8 years old, 59% male, 86% White, non-Hispanic) on average were from relatively less disadvantaged neighborhoods (ADI national decile = 33 ± 25, range = 1-98). Greater neighborhood disadvantage at study entry was cross-sectionally associated with elevated CSF YKL-40 (β = 0.7, <i>p</i> = 0.003) and tau (β = 1.8, <i>p</i> = 0.04) after excluding outliers. Greater neighborhood disadvantage at study entry related to faster longitudinal increases in plasma CRP (β = 0.005, <i>p</i> = 0.03). Greater neighborhood disadvantage was associated with elevated inflammatory and AD CSF biomarkers cross-sectionally and longitudinal increases in a nonspecific inflammatory blood biomarker. Findings suggest that neighborhood disadvantage confers risk of systemic inflammation and AD pathology, providing a possible sociobiological mechanism underlying health disparities in aging adults; however, results were limited by use of ADI at study entry.",Neurology,2025,Marissa A Gogniat; Omair A Khan; Brina Ratangee; Corey J Bolton; Panpan Zhang; Dandan Liu; Kimberly R Pechman; Alexis Yates; Leslie S Gaynor; James Eaton; Amalia Peterson; Katherine A Gifford; Timothy J Hohman; Kaj Blennow; Henrik Zetterberg; Angela L Jefferson

40561371,Neuropathic Pain and Distinct CASPR2 Autoantibody IgG Subclasses Drive Neuronal Hyperexcitability.,"Patients with autoantibodies (aAbs) against the contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2) suffer from a variety of clinical syndromes including neuropathic pain. CASPR2 is an adhesion protein of the neurexin family and part of the voltage-gated potassium channel complex (VGKC complex) in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. The pathologic mechanisms following the binding of CASPR2 aAbs and their association with pain are only partially understood. CASPR2 aAbs are mainly of the IgG4 subclass; however, previous studies have neglected subclass-dependent effects. We investigated 49 subclassified patient serum samples positive for CASPR2 aAbs combining superresolution lattice structural illumination microscopy (SIM<sup>2</sup>) and functional readouts by calcium imaging and electrophysiologic recordings on cultured DRG neurons. CASPR2-positive patient sera subclassified in IgG4 together with at least 1 other IgG subclass (IgGX) and patients with only IgG4 were further subdivided into the pain and no pain groups. A decrease of CASPR2 expression along the axons after exposure to CASPR2 aAbs was observed for all patient groups except the group without pain and IgG4. Moreover, binding of CASPR2 aAbs from patients with pain increased the distance between CASPR2 and associated potassium channels along DRG axons determined by SIM<sup>2</sup> microscopy. CASPR2 aAbs of patients with pain significantly increased overall neuronal excitability of cultured DRG neurons as measured by calcium imaging. Patch-clamp recordings revealed significantly decreased current amplitudes of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels after incubation with all 4 CASPR2 aAb subclassifications with the most prominent effect of serum samples harboring IgG4 aAbs only. Replacement of patient aAbs by healthy control serum rescued Kv channel function to normal levels suggesting that the affected potassium channel function is due to structural blockage and disrupted interactions within the VGKC complex. The last might also be rescued on novel protein synthesis and membrane trafficking of CASPR2. IgG4 aAbs seem to be the major modifier of potassium channel function. The DRG hyperexcitability is primarily due to impaired Kv channel conductance as a consequence of CASPR2 aAb binding. However, additional unidentified signal pathways contribute to this process in patients with neuropathic pain.",Neurology(R) neuroimmunology & neuroinflammation,2025,Margarita Habib; Anna-Lena Wiessler; Patrik Fischer; Michele Niesner; Mareike Selcho; Ligia Abrante; Christian Werner; Annemarie Sodmann; Maximilian Koch; Abdolhossein Zare; Harald Prüss; Justina Dargvainiene; Jan Lewerenz; Robert Handreka; Peter Körtvelyessy; Dirk Reinhold; Franziska S Thaler; Kalliopi Pitarokoili; Robert J Kittel; Michael Briese; Michael Sendtner; Heike Rittner; Frank Leypoldt; Claudia Sommer; Robert Blum; Kathrin Doppler; Carmen Villmann
40561304,Search for information on food and nutrition and its intersections with eating behavior and body image.,"This quantitative study associated the search for information about food and nutrition with body image and eating behavior in men and women. An online survey was conducted from December 2021 to March 2022, with 518 adults participating via social media and email invites. The survey included demographic questions, information-seeking behavior, beauty ideals, media influence, body satisfaction, investment in appearance, and disordered eating. Two-way ANOVAs and Path analysis were used. Most participants were women, white, heterosexual, and single, with an average age of 31 years and body mass index (BMI) of 25.9 kg/m². Most participants looked up information about food and nutrition (81.7%; n = 423) and used Google® as their primary source (45.2%; n = 191). Path analysis revealed that searching for information is positively associated with satisfaction with appearance, BMI, media pressure, and time spent on social networks. Conversely, there is a negative relationship between satisfaction with appearance and seeking information and between investment in appearance and searching for such information.",Ciencia & saude coletiva,2025,Keila Priscila Dos Santos Avelar; Maria Fernanda Laus
40561277,Prediction of early myocardial damage in obstructive sleep apnea patients using combined logistic regression and QUEST decision tree models.,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is linked to cardiovascular complications, including myocardial dysfunction, yet early detection remains difficult. This retrospective study aimed to develop a combined logistic regression and QUEST decision tree model to predict early myocardial dysfunction in OSA patients. Echocardiography left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) and right ventricular free wall longitudinal strain (RVFWLS) were used to assess myocardial function in OSA patients. Predictive models were constructed using clinical parameters. External validation involved 100 OSA patients from a respiratory sleep clinic. LVGLS and RVFWLS were significantly impaired in OSA patients, particularly in moderate-to-severe cases. BMI, percentage of sleep time with oxygen saturation <90% (CT90%), and arterial bicarbonate were identified as key predictors. The combined model achieved superior predictive accuracy, with an area under the curve of 0.91 for LVGLS and RVFWLS reductions, outperforming individual models. External validation confirmed the stability and generalizability of the model. The combined logistic regression and QUEST decision tree model accurately predicted early myocardial dysfunction in OSA patients, providing a valuable tool for personalized risk assessment and early intervention.",Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,2025,Chong Pei; Zhen Ding; Lei Hu; Shuyu Gui

This study evaluated the the potential therapeutic effect of Africanized honey bee venom (Apis mellifera L.) on LID in mice. Prior to bee venom (BV) or amantadine treatment, mice received medial forebrain bundle microinjections of 6-hydroxydopamine or ascorbate saline. The animals received dose of levodopa (6mg.Kg-1 for 5 days and 12mg.Kg-1 for 10 days) combined with a dose of 12 mg.Kg-1 of benserazide, for 15 days. Amantadine (40mg.Kg-1) or BV were administered at different dosages (0.1; 0.5 or 1mg.Kg-1) once every 2 days, starting from the last day of levodopa administration, for 2 weeks. The evaluation of abnormal involuntary movements, cylinder test, open field, rotational behavior and wire suspension were done on the day following the last administration of treatment. Was carried the histopathological analysis. The chemical composition of BV was also assessed, identifying the highest concentrations of apamin, phospholipase A2 and melittin and the antioxidant activity. Treatment with BV at a dose of 0.1mg.kg-1 reduced apomorphine-induced rotations, increased the number of contralateral contacts to the lesion, and increased grip strength, restoring motor control impaired by LIDs, indicating potential therapeutic efficacy.",Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias,2025,Camila G Dantas; Adriano A S Araújo; Ricardo Luiz C DE Albuquerque Junior; Edna A F Cândido; Margarete Z Gomes; Luiz P DA Costa

Cross-sectional study, conducted in the city of Rio de Janeiro, with 56 nurses in the reception service with risk classification in the emergency and urgency network. The Questionnaire for Assessment of Violence at Work and the Self-Report Questionnaire were used. The Wilcoxon, chi-square, and Fisher's exact tests were used for analysis. The threat variable had a statistically significant difference (p = 0.031). Among the grouped symptoms, the predominant complaint of factor 1 (depressed/anxious mood) in the question ""feeling nervous, tense, or worried"" had 42 (75%) positive answers.

40561244,Demographic Analysis of Populations Accessing an Overdose Response Training Created at a College of Pharmacy.,"To analyze and compare demographics of two distinct populations accessing an online opioid overdose response training program hosted on two websites. A retrospective comparative analysis was completed using post-training survey data collected from October 2019 through October 2023. The training and survey were accessible through the University of Rhode Island and Rhode Island Department of Health websites. Demographics were compared between access points and to characteristics of populations at-risk for overdose. 4,785 surveys were included. Participants accessing the training through the university website were more likely to be racial minorities and students. Participants accessing through the Department of Health were more likely to be gender minorities, low-income, and work in healthcare or trades. No differences in rurality or education level existed; both groups indicated satisfaction with training. The same online overdose response training can reach different populations with demographic characteristics associated with increased overdose risk when made accessible through multiple access points.",Rhode Island medical journal (2013),2025,Michaela Pacheco; Abiodun Ologunowa; Anita Jacobson
40561212,"Economic Burden of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Panic Anxiety, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).","Considering the importance of depression and anxiety disorders in the new century and one of the important causes of disability and lost years worldwide and imposing a huge cost on the global economy, economic burden studies to determine the location of costs and the consumption of medical resources in recent years have contributed a lot to health policymaking. During the studies, it was found that the prevalence of these disorders increased significantly in Iran. This reason, along with the difference in the results of studies on the economic burden of depression and anxiety published in Iran in recent years, was one of the reasons for conducting a study of the economic burden related to these disorders in the East Azarbaijan province of Iran.  A retrospective, non-interventional, cross-sectional, social perspective study was conducted using a bottom-up approach for direct costs and a human capital approach for indirect costs. The data was collected from outpatients over the first four months of 2022 and from inpatients over the first nine months of the same year. Patients without age limits and suffering from at least one major depressive disorder (F32.0-F33.9), panic anxiety (F41.0), and generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1) and natives of East Azerbaijan province were included in the study. In the study for direct costs, the cost of measures that are paid directly in the process of diagnosis and treatment (medical and non-medical) were examined separately for outpatients and inpatients. For indirect costs, lost productivity due to absenteeism and premature death was calculated. For outpatients, a researcher's fee checklist form was made, and for the data of inpatients, the financial statement available in the medical file of the hospital's accounting system was used. Razi Tabriz and Imam Khomeini Benab hospitals and mental health centers of Tabriz were used as public centers, and specialist psychiatrists' offices of Tabriz were used as private centers. Patients with more than one comorbidity were excluded from the study. Total costs are reported at purchasing power parity rates.  The data of 145 outpatients and 198 inpatients were analyzed to calculate the economic burden of MDD, Panic Anxiety, and GAD. The total economic burden for these disorders was obtained by 142.2 million purchasing power parity (ppp) dollars in 2022 for the East Azarbaijan province of Iran, with a population of more than 3.5 million people. The economic burden was divided into direct costs of 35.4 million dollars ppp and indirect costs of 106.79 million dollars ppp, representing 24.9% and 75.1%, respectively. The share of direct expenses of the outpatient group is 23.1% of this percentage, and the remaining 1.8% is for the inpatient group. In the case of indirect cost, from the percentage related to this sector, the share of lost productivity due to lost working days is 65.84%, and 9.26% is lost productivity due to premature death. For the outpatient group, the cost of medicine with 58.64% of the cost per person, and in the inpatient group, the cost of patient hoteling with 55.63%, and the visit of a psychiatrist with 20.34% of the direct cost per hospitalized person, the largest share of the direct costs of these people they assigned themselves. According to the method adopted in the study, the total cost showed the highest sensitivity to the GDP Per Capita (ppp) and the prevalence rate of anxiety and the prevalence rate of depression, respectively.   Based on the results of the study, it is clear that indirect costs account for a significant share of the economic burden. Also, although the direct costs per inpatient are higher than the direct costs per outpatient, due to the difference in the number of outpatients and inpatients, the direct costs of the outpatient group have a larger share of the total cost of the disease. Considering the average age of patients and the large age gap to retirement age, health policymakers should take necessary measures to deal with and prevent the ever-increasing costs.",The journal of mental health policy and economics,2025,Ali Abdollahi Najand Asl; Ali Imani; Mostafa Farahbakhsh; Parvin Sarbakhsh
40561176,Construction of a Prognostic Model Using RNA Processing Factor Genes and the Key Role of NSUN6 in Glioma Outcomes.,"Glioma is the most common malignant brain tumor and remains associated with a poor prognosis and limited predictive tools. The dysregulation of RNA processing factor genes has been implicated in glioma development, yet their prognostic relevance remains unclear. This study aimed to construct a robust prognostic model based on RNA processing factor genes and explore their functional roles and therapeutic potential. Transcriptomic and clinical data from glioma patients in the TCGA, CGGA, GEO and Rembrandt cohorts were analysed. Univariate, multivariate and LASSO-Cox regression analyses were performed to establish a prognostic signature. Model performance was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, time-dependent ROC analysis and C-index evaluation. Key genes were identified via random forest analysis and validated through single-cell datasets and immunohistochemistry. Functional assays were conducted to examine the biological roles of the key gene. Seventy-eight RNA processing factor genes were associated with glioma prognosis, and a 19-gene risk signature was constructed. The model effectively stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups with significantly different survival outcomes (log-rank p < 0.001). The AUCs for 1-, 3- and 5-year survival were 0.812, 0.774 and 0.769 in TCGA and 0.796, 0.758 and 0.741 in CGGA. The model achieved a C-index of 0.781 and was validated as an independent prognostic factor. NSUN6 was identified as a key protective gene whose overexpression inhibited glioma cell proliferation and migration in vitro. RNA processing factor genes have prognostic utility in glioma. The 19-gene model and NSUN6 highlight novel avenues for molecular stratification and targeted therapy.",Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,2025,Jiarui Chen; Caidi Ying; Zhaowen Gu; Bingrui Zhu; Junjie Wang; Yajun Qian; Haiyan Zheng; Jianming Zhang; Yongjie Wang
40561168,Understanding the audiological care of patients with co-existing dementia or mild cognitive impairment and hearing loss in the United Kingdom National Health Service: A qualitative study.,"Hearing loss is common among people living with dementia and can exacerbate the symptoms associated with dementia. The effective management of hearing loss can positively impact quality of life and help alleviate dementia-related symptoms. Little is known about current audiological pathways in the National Health Service (NHS) for adults living with dementia or mild cognitive impairment. To understand the current NHS audiological care pathways for adults living with dementia or mild cognitive impairment. Qualitative study. Thirty-three NHS audiologists in the United Kingdom (UK) completed a qualitative survey about current adult audiological care pathways for people living with dementia or mild cognitive impairment, and 14 of those also participated in a follow-up interview. Data from the surveys and interviews were combined and analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. The key findings included the importance of person-centred care, the active involvement of carers, and the need for tailored approaches, including using adapted and additional tests to assess hearing loss while offering a variety of hearing interventions. Audiologists expressed a desire for more service integration, such as domiciliary visits, and emphasised the importance of adapting environments and practices, such as dementia-friendly spaces and routine dementia education for staff, to better support individuals living with these co-existing conditions. These findings can help inform the development of formal clinical practice guidelines and evidence-based training to support audiological care for people living with dementia and mild cognitive impairment in the United Kingdom.",PloS one,2025,Sian Calvert; Aaron Chitty; Alex Langdon; Emma Broome; Helen Henshaw; Sarah Somerset; Tom Dening; Eithne Heffernan
40561143,Seeding amplification assay with Universal Control Fluid: Standardized detection of α-synucleinopathies.,"Seeding amplification assays, specifically the Real-Time Quaking-Induced Conversion method (RT-QuIC), have shown great diagnostic potential for α-synucleinopathies. Numerous research groups have demonstrated the method's high sensitivity and specificity using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and various RT-QuIC workflows. However, establishing a uniform and stably performing RT-QuIC protocol remains challenging. To address this, we established an RT-QuIC protocol with a Universal Control Fluid (UCF), which is simple to adopt, performs stably, and allows uniform preparation of both sample and control reactions. Firstly, we adapted and established a published 48-hour RT-QuIC protocol, including the in-house production of recombinant α-synuclein (rec α-syn), and evaluated its sensitivity and specificity through a blinded screening of an 81 CSF sample cohort consisting of Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Alzheimer's disease, motor neuron disease, multiple system atrophy, unidentified neurodegenerative diseases, and healthy controls. Additionally, we tested all CSF samples in three volumes to determine which volume provides the best diagnostic accuracy. The established RT-QuIC performs nearly equally well with 7 µL and 15 µL added CSF, resulting in 94% and 94.5% diagnostic accuracy, respectively. Secondly, we developed a UCF solution and tested its performance with the established RT-QuIC protocol. Results indicate that UCF, used in defined volume and concentration, standardizes the preparation of both sample and control reactions without compromising the assay's diagnostic accuracy and provides a stabilizing environment for the reactions, ensuring higher reproducibility. The established RT-QuIC protocol for pathologic α-synuclein detection in PD and DLB CSF samples is highly sensitive (92-96%) and specific (93-96%). Therefore, it is important that its adoption in clinical laboratories is uncomplicated and uniform. RT-QuIC with UCF simplifies, standardizes, and stabilizes the assay's performance and, thus, could be recommended as a standard protocol for accurate detection of α-synucleinopathies.",PloS one,2025,Remarh Bsoul; Anja H Simonsen; Kristian S Frederiksen; Kirsten Svenstrup; Sara Bech; Lisette Salvesen; Anne-Mette Hejl; Marcello Rossi; Piero Parchi; Eva L Lund; Aušrinė Areškevičiūtė
40561124,Associations between dietary microbe intake and mortality risk in individuals with sleep disorders: Evidence from NHANES.,"To investigate the association between dietary microbial intake, sleep patterns, and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality among U.S. adults. This study is conducted using data from the 2005-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Kaplan-Meier curves are used to preliminarily explore the relationship between dietary microbial intake, sleep disorders, and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in the population. The Cox proportional hazards model is applied for both individual and combined analyses to examine the relationship between dietary microbial intake, sleep disorders, and mortality risk, with subgroup and sensitivity analyses performed to assess model stability. This study included 21,233 participants, among whom 2,814 all-cause deaths and 877 cardiovascular deaths were documented. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a significant association between low dietary microbial intake or sleep disorders and elevated mortality. Cox proportional hazards modeling showed that, among individuals with sleep disorders, those with moderate dietary microbe intake had a lower mortality hazard ratio compared to those with low intake. Conversely, the combination of low dietary microbe intake and sleep disorders was associated with the highest all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses demonstrated consistent associations across prespecified strata, with the inverse relationship between dietary live microbe intake and sleep disorder-related mortality remaining robust after adjustment for confounders. Low dietary microbial intake and sleep disorders were independently and jointly associated with higher rates of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in population. The observed inverse association between higher dietary microbial intake and mortality outcomes, particularly among individuals with sleep disorders, suggests a potential protective trend.",PloS one,2025,Xuanchun Huang; Lanshuo Hu; Ruikang Liu; Jun Li; Tiantian Xue
40561108,"Mental health disorders among children with special health needs: A population-based cohort study using linked administrative data from Manitoba, Canada.","An estimated 15-22% of Canadian kindergarten-age children have a special health need (SHN), defined as a clinical diagnosis, a functional need requiring special accommodation at school, or a health condition leading to increased needs. Children with SHN may be more likely to experience mental health disorders than their peers without SHN, placing them at risk for further health and academic challenges. Our objective was to determine the odds of children with SHN identified in kindergarten being diagnosed with a mental health disorder by age 16. In this retrospective cohort study using population-based, linked administrative data, we identified children with SHN born 1995-2020 in Manitoba, Canada, and enrolled in kindergarten from 2006-2011. The SHN designation is derived from the Early Development Instrument. We measured prevalence of common childhood mental health disorders (ADHD, mood/anxiety disorders, conduct disorders) in children with SHN to age 16. Using binary logistic regressions, we calculated crude odds ratios (OR) for children with vs. without SHN being diagnosed with a mental health disorder, then adjusted for age, sex, and neighbourhood-level income. Among 42,766 children, 13.8% had a SHN designation in kindergarten. Among these, 41.0% were diagnosed with a mental health disorder by age 16. The odds of a mental health diagnosis by SHN category were: special needs designation in kindergarten (OR 1.75, 95%CI 1.53-2.01); learning impairment (OR 1.61, 95%CI 1.39-1.86); behavioural impairment (OR 3.27, 95%CI 2.87-3.72); and emotional impairment (OR 2.01, 95%CI 1.75-2.32). Children with SHN (vs. none) had higher odds of a mental health disorder if they had 1 + impairment (OR 1.67, 95%CI 1.50-1.85). Adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics did not change the estimates. The study highlights important kindergarten predictors of future mental health disorders in children, which should be used to inform preventive and supportive strategies for children with SHN and help generate wider mental health supports in schools.",PloS one,2025,Jennifer E Enns; Caroline Reid-Westoby; Gilles R Detillieux; Marni Brownell; Nathan C Nickel; Anne Gadermann; Astrid Guttmann; Teresa Bennett; Eric Duku; Barry Forer; Monique Gagné Petteni; Katholiki Georgiades; Martin Guhn; Ana Hanlon-Dearman; Brenda T Poon; Magdalena Janus
40561107,"Effects of pension eligibility expansion on men's memory decline and dementia probability: Findings from the HAALSI cohort in rural South Africa, 2014-2021.","Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are a growing global health concern, with burdens projected to expand rapidly in the coming decades. Since cognitive decline typically precedes ADRD, it is crucial to identify interventions that may help slow cognitive decline and reduce ADRD risk. We used a quasi-experimental design, exploiting exogenous expansions of South Africa's Older Persons Grant for men, to estimate its impact on memory decline and ADRD risk in the rural Mpumalanga province of South Africa. We found that expanded pension eligibility was associated with slower memory decline for men who were eligible to receive the pension 5 years earlier [β = 0.027 SD, 95% CI = 0.023, 0.031], as well as for men who were eligible to receive the pension 1-4 years earlier [β = 0.009 SD, 95% CI = 0.004, 0.013]. We also found a 5.2 percentage point lower probability of dementia for men who were eligible for pension 5 years earlier [95% CI = -0.062, -0.032] and a 4.8 percentage point lower probability of dementia for men who became eligible to receive pension 1-4 years earlier [95% CI = -0.062, -0.032]. These findings demonstrate that beyond the policy intent of cash transfers to strengthen individual and household livelihoods, an important further benefit lies in promoting healthy cognitive aging in low- and middle- income countries.",PloS one,2025,Janet Jock; Erika T Beidelman; Meredith Phillips; Lindsay C Kobayashi; Xiwei Chen; Stephen Tollman; Chodziwadziwa Whiteson Kabudula; Darina T Bassil; Ryan Wagner; Lisa Berkman; Molly Rosenberg
40561028,Perineural immune environment of olfactory nerves is reshaped by neuroinflammatory drainage and connects to ethmoid bone marrow.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contains inflammatory cues that enable peripheral immune surveillance of the central nervous system (CNS). While some cranial nerves allow for CSF efflux, the immune environment around CSF-interfacing cranial nerves during neuroinflammation is still poorly understood. Using a mouse model of multiple sclerosis [experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)] and CNS <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> infection (CNS-Mtb), we examined immune responses around olfactory nerve bundles near the cribriform plate, a key CSF efflux route. During neuroinflammation, we found increased perineural immune cells that had access to intracranial injected beads, dye, and bacteria. Additionally, we identified osseous channels connecting the environment surrounding olfactory nerves to bone marrow in the cribriform plate (cpBM). Notably, the cpBM undergoes myelopoiesis during EAE, has access to components of intracranial drainage, and is vulnerable to Mtb bacteria invasion during CNS-Mtb infection. Our findings improve the understanding of how the environments of CSF-interfacing cranial nerves and bone marrow are altered within the skull during neuroinflammatory disease.",Science advances,2025,Collin J Laaker; Kristof G Kovacs; Cameron M Baenen; Martin Hsu; Jenna M Port; Sophia M Vrba; Mohan Kumar; Annika J Hubacek; Melinda Herbath; Thanthrige Thiunuwan Priyathilaka; Matyas Sandor; Zsuzsanna Fabry
40560987,Predictive validity of early and mid-year literacy assessments for end-of-year word reading fluency.,"This study explores the predictive validity of early and mid-year literacy assessments-Letter Naming Fluency (LNF), Letter Sound Fluency (LSF), and Phoneme Segmentation Fluency (PSF)-for end-of-year Word Reading Fluency (WRF) in kindergarten and grade 1 Arabic-speaking students. Using a longitudinal design, 412 students were assessed at three intervals (fall, mid-year, and year-end) to examine how these foundational literacy skills contribute to predicting WRF and identifying at-risk readers. Results from multiple regression analyses indicate that both LNF and LSF are significant predictors of end-of-year WRF across both fall and mid-year assessments, with mid-year measures demonstrating enhanced predictive accuracy. In contrast, PSF showed limited predictive value in comparison to LNF and LSF. Accuracy analyses revealed that mid-year assessments, particularly LNF and LSF, were more reliable in identifying at-risk students compared to fall assessments. Mid-year assessments correctly identified 64-73% of at-risk readers, emphasizing their value in early detection and intervention. These findings underline the importance of dynamic, multi-point assessments in improving educational practices and outcomes, particularly for students at risk of reading difficulties. The study highlights the critical role of foundational literacy skills in early reading development and provides actionable insights to enhance intervention strategies during key stages of literacy acquisition.",PloS one,2025,Saeed Saad Alqahtani
40560963,Analysis of retinal markers and incident amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: An optical coherence tomography-based cohort study.,"Biomarkers are widely recognized as crucial breakthroughs in tackling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Among them, retina markers may hold promise due to the close retina-brain connection and non-invasive, portable detection methods. Thus, using optical coherence tomography (OCT), we investigated the link between baseline cell-level retinal features and future ALS risk. Participants from the UK Biobank underwent OCT scans to assess retinal layers, macula, and optic disc parameters. Follow-up commenced two years after the baseline period (2006-2010), during which ALS cases were identified using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes from medical and assessment records. Cox proportional hazards models were applied to examine the relationship between retinal markers and incident ALS. Over a median follow-up of 14.11 years, 70 ALS cases occurred among 53,824 participants (incidence 10.58 per 100,000 person-years). Most participants were White (94.6%), 44.8% male, with a median age of 58 years. After adjusting for demographics and comorbidities affecting the retina, a standard deviation (SD) decrease of 15.19 µm in photoreceptor layer (PRL) thickness was associated with a 19% (95% confidence interval [7, 29]; p = 0.002) increased risk of ALS, while a SD increase of 26.11 µm in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) thickness corresponded to a 20% (95% CI [7, 34]; p = 0.002) higher risk. Sensitivity analyses excluding follow-ups of less than 4 and 6 years yielded consistent results. Subgroup analyses showed these findings were more pronounced in smokers. The main limitation of this study is its single time point observational design. A thinner PRL and thicker RPE may precede the clinical diagnosis of ALS, offering potential clues for early diagnosis and insights into the disease's pathogenesis.",PLoS medicine,2025,Chunyang Pang; Yaojia Li; Wenhua Jiang; Haobo Xie; Wen Cao; Huan Yu; Zhiyang Lin; Yifan Cheng; Dongsheng Fan; Binbin Deng
40560959,Computer-aided discovery of dual-target compounds for Alzheimer's from ayurvedic medicinal plants.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, driven by the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. It involves the dysfunction of key enzymes such as Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and β-secretase (BACE1), making them critical targets for therapeutic intervention. In this study we investigated an in-house library of 820 secondary metabolites obtained from Ayurvedic plants against AChE and BACE1 with the aim to discover novel leads for AD. Virtual screening resulted in 15 ligands, mostly belonging to the ursane-type or dammarene-type triterpene saponins of Centella asiatica, reestablishing the potency of this plant in drug discovery against AD. The binding affinities were further verified by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, including root mean square fluctuations (RMSF), root mean square deviation (RMSD), hydrogen bonding analysis, Coulomb interaction calculation, Lennard-Jones interactions, and the total interaction energy. Moreover, extensive Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Gibbs free energy landscape were performed. Our results demonstrated three compounds, namely (S)-eriodictyol 7-O-(6-β-O-trans-p-coumaroyl)-β-d-glucopyranoside, sitoindoside-X and 1,5-di-o-caffeoyl quinic acid as more effective in treating AD due to their comparable drug-like properties. Drug-likeness, structural chemistry, pharmacophore, and ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) analysis support their potential for future drug development. To establish the effectiveness of these lead compounds against AD, additional experimental testing should be performed.",PloS one,2025,Mohibullah Shah; Sadia Pervaiz; Iqra Ahmad; Shahid Habib Ansari; Valdir Ferreira De Paula Junior; Sibtain Ahmed; Muhammed Umer Khan; Khaled Fahmi Fawy; Umar Nishan; Hanna Dib; Mohamed A O Abdelfattah
40560940,The influence of hydrogel stiffness on axonal regeneration after spinal cord injury.,"The core challenge in spinal cord injury(SCI) treatment is promoting axonal regeneration and forming new neural connections in damaged areas. However, mature CNS neurons have limited regenerative capacity, causing long-term dysfunction. Axonal regeneration involves elongating axons guided by growth cones, which sense and respond to external mechanical signals, integrating them into cytoskeleton reconstruction. After injury, growth cones experience altered mechanical forces due to changes in ECM stiffness. However, systematic studies on matrix stiffness's impact on axonal regeneration post-SCI remain insufficient. This study investigates the influence of hydrogel stiffness on axonal regeneration following SCI. Using gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels with varying stiffness levels, we cultured dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons in vitro and applied the hydrogels to a complete transection SCI mouse model. Results demonstrated that higher stiffness GelMA (15% w/v) significantly enhanced axonal extension and sensory functional recovery compared to lower stiffness (7.5% w/v). The study highlights the critical role of ECM stiffness in regulating axonal regeneration and suggests that optimizing hydrogel stiffness can promote neural regeneration and functional recovery after SCI. These findings provide valuable insights for developing therapeutic strategies in SCI treatment.",PloS one,2025,Haiyang Deng; Jiaqing Zhou; Cong Long; Ping Luo; Zhong Xiang; Hao Zeng
40560908,The opportunity to save a life: A qualitative study of a point-of-care overdose education and naloxone distribution intervention.,"Canada's opioid crisis continues to escalate. Naloxone can effectively reverse the effects of opioid overdose. We planned a randomized trial on the effectiveness of a point-of-care overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) intervention on participants' performance in a simulated opioid overdose scenario. In preparation for the trial, we conducted a feasibility study which included a qualitative process evaluation aimed at eliciting participants' perspectives of the study's OEND tool and procedures, and how their lived experiences of the opioid crisis intersected with their experiences of the study. Twenty-three participants were interviewed, including people with lived experiences of opioid use or overdose, and people living in neighbourhoods or working in services where they were likely to encounter overdose. Thematic analysis of interview transcripts was informed by stigma theory. Participants' accounts depicted challenges faced by people who take opioids in their everyday lives, deep losses experienced, negative attitudes encountered, and systemic barriers to care. Participation in the study itself was portrayed as meaningful. We explored participants' experiences through three key themes: (1) who were the participants - describing their experiences related to opioid overdose, opioid use and attendant stigma; (2) why did they participate - recounting their motivations to join the study; and (3) what they thought about study processes - reflecting on the OEND materials and study procedures. Accounts revealed a sense of agency as participants confronted the opioid crisis. Our results demonstrate that people experiencing opioid use and overdose and people who care about them are eager and willing to be approached about research at point of care; participants were eager to learn overdose prevention skills and to return for follow-up study sessions. They recounted a range of motivations for participating, the most important of which is the opportunity to actively intervene, save lives and raise awareness.

40560906,Evaluation of nerve function after Bell's palsy based on different facial nerve assessment scales HBGS/SFGS/MPS: A comparative study.,"Studies have shown that approximately 30% of patients with Bell's palsy may experience permanent disfigurement due to muscle weakness affecting facial expressions. The prognosis for Bell's palsy is often correlated with the degree of impairment in facial nerve function observed in the early stages of the condition. Selecting appropriate assessment tools is essential for the effective treatment and prognosis of patients with Bell's palsy. Examine and compare three scales used to measure Bell's palsy: the House-Brackmann Grading Scale (HBGS), the Sunnybrook Facial Grading System (SFGS), and the Modified Portmann Scale (MPS). A retrospective study involved 97 patients with Bell's palsy treated at the authors' institution from 2021 to 2022. The authors accessed these data for research purposes in February 2025. The patient cohort underwent HBGS, SFGS, and MPS to assess facial nerve function before and after treatment. We compared the results of these three evaluation methods. Additionally, we performed correlation analyses and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses of the post-treatment data to examine the relationships between HBGS and SFGS and between HBGS and MPS, using the internationally recognized and most widely utilized HBGS as the standard. The HBGS demonstrated moderate consistency with both the FSGS and MPS, revealing significant negative correlations (r = -0.876, P < 0.01; r = -0.860, P < 0.01). All three scales exhibited high reactivity and showed no ceiling/floor effect. The optimal cut-off values for the FSGS and MPS were determined to be ≤ 68 and ≤ 16 points, respectively, with AUC of 0.948 (95% CI: 0.910-0.984) and 0.931 (95% CI: 0.883-0.968). HBGS, SFGS, and MPS are all appropriate tools for assessing Bell's palsy. The severity of facial nerve palsy can be clinically classified using a transect score of 68 on the SFGS and 16 on the MPS. However, the results should be interpreted with caution, as objective indicators were not utilized as criteria.",PloS one,2025,Zhanxiang Lin; Xiaoyang Fei; Lichao Huang; Yuchun Shao; Zicai Liu
40560886,Novel insights from comprehensive analysis: The role of cuproptosis and peripheral immune infiltration in Alzheimer's disease.,"Cuproptosis is increasingly recognized as an essential factor in the pathological process of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the specific role of cuproptosis-related genes in AD remains poorly understood. Our first step was to obtain gene expression data from the GEO database and identify differentially expressed cuproptosis-associated genes (DECAGs) in AD. GO, KEGG, and GSEA analyses were then conducted on these genes. Subsequently, we attempted to classify AD patients by unsupervised clustering. Then, four machine-learning models were used to screen hub-genes from the DECAGs. We also explored the immune features of these genes and predicted target drugs. Molecular docking analysis was then performed on the predicted drugs and their corresponding hub-gene related proteins. Candidate markers were then validated by single-cell analysis and intracellular communication was investigated in a GEO scRNA-seq dataset. Lastly, we examined the expression levels of the hub-genes in peripheral blood cells using real-time quantitative PCR. 19 DECAGs were found in AD and the key biological processes and molecular functions associated with AD were further determined. Two subtypes of peripheral blood cells showed significant alternations in AD: Cluster1 and Cluster2. Five hub-genes including FDX1, GLS, PDK1, MAP2K1, and SOD1 were then screened out from the machine-learning study. All of the five hub-genes were significantly correlated with various immunocytes. We discovered compounds targeting hub-gene related proteins and forecasted multiple strong hydrogen bonding interactions between the picked predicted drugs and the target proteins by molecular docking analysis. Subsequently, in the single-cell analysis of AD peripheral blood, all hub-genes except SOD1 were found to be up-regulated in B cells, NK cells, and CD4+ T cells, possibly acting on the MIF pathway. Finally, we discovered that the levels of PDK1 expression in AD patients were remarkably upregulated, while FDX1 and GLS were significantly decreased using qPCR. This study examined changes in intercellular communication between immune cells in the peripheral blood and identified five novel feature genes associated with cuproptosis in AD patients. These results facilitated a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of AD and suggested novel therapeutic targets.",PloS one,2025,Jing Wang; Zi-Wen Yu; Qi Liu; Jing-Xun Wu; Yi-Dan Zhang; Hui-Juan Wan; Min Bi; Nai-An Xiao; Kun-Mu Zheng; Bin Jiang
40560842,Comparative mRNA profile analysis from NAc of adolescent male mice after binge-like alcohol exposure eliciting deficits in context fear extinction learning.,"Stressor-related disorders frequently co-occur with alcohol use disorder (AUD). This necessitates an understanding of the physiological and genetic factors contributing to this relationship. Binge drinking is the most common method of alcohol consumption among adolescent males and significantly increases the risk of developing comorbid stressor-related disorders and AUD. In experiments modeling the effects of a single binge-like alcohol exposure in male adolescent mice, we observed a clear deficit in context extinction learning. This exposure led to a significant initial increase in subsequent voluntary drinking on day one, as measured by the every-other-day (EOD) two-bottle choice drinking assay, which normalized thereafter. For this study we performed an mRNASeq analysis of mice nucleus accumbens (NAc), a region intricately involved in regulating both aversive contextual fear responses and reward, after EOD to profile the differential expression of mRNAs within this region. We also used immunohistochemistry of coronal brain slices to characterize expression of proteins associated with stress-related disorders and molecular alcohol tolerance, such as FKBP5, GSK3ß, and ß-catenin, within the striatum, nucleus accumbens (NAc), hippocampus, and basolateral amygdala (BLA). Comparative mRNA profile analysis reveals significant long-term changes in gene expression induced by binge-like alcohol exposure, even 30 days after the initial exposure. Immunohistochemistry showed a full recovery of previously observed altered levels of target proteins prior to EOD. These findings suggest that the temporal activation of specific gene subsets plays a crucial role in the comorbidity of AUD and stressor-related diseases. Understanding these mechanisms can help develop more effective, integrated treatment approaches to improve outcomes for affected individuals.",PloS one,2025,Mario E Lloret Torres; Arelys Rivas Jiménez; Eduardo L Tosado Rodríguez; Kiara Cardona Jordan; Xiany X Lay Rivera; Yaren L Peña Señeriz; Joseph L Capella Muñiz; Marieliz Dieppa Rodríguez; Daniel F Ruiz Bolívar; Jovangelis González Del Toro; John A Florian Alsina; Paola A Colón Rivera; Jose O Garcia Colon; Abiel Roche-Lima; Cristina Velázquez-Marrero
40560839,"Behavioral and Metabolomics Analyses of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> with Chronobiotic Melatonin Treatment: Effects on Locomotor Activity, Circadian Integrity, and Metabolic Pathways.","Circadian rhythm and the sleep/wake cycle can influence metabolic regulation, eating habits, hormone release, and common chronic health conditions such as obesity, depression, diabetes, and sleep disorders. <i>Drosophila melanogaster,</i> the fruit fly, with its conserved molecular clocks and accessible assays, has been used as an ideal model system to study biological processes, for example, circadian rhythms, sleep, neurodevelopment, genetics, and behavior. Using an integrated approach combining high-throughput locomotor activity monitoring and untargeted metabolomics, we analyzed the behavioral and metabolic effects of a chronobiotic melatonin. The behavioral activity of fruit flies was recorded using an infrared-based monitoring device, followed by data analysis with open-source data packages ShinyR-DAM and VANESSA. We found that 1 mM and 4 mM melatonin doses significantly increased <i>Drosophila</i> locomotor activity. Melatonin at a high concentration (4 mM) exhibited a protective effect to reduce mortality in <i>Drosophila</i>. Despite these changes, melatonin preserved the flies' endogenous bimodal activity pattern, maintaining circadian alignment. Metabolomics analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry identified differentially abundant metabolites after melatonin administration compared with the vehicle treatment. We discovered 20 biologically relevant metabolites altered by melatonin, including key perturbations in arginine biosynthesis, alanine/aspartate/glutamate metabolism, and pyrimidine pathways. Notably, melatonin upregulated glutamine, a potential indicator of enhanced neurotransmitter synthesis and broadly modulated amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, suggesting dual roles in neuroprotection and energy homeostasis. This high-throughput omics study uncovers melatonin-induced behavioral and metabolic perturbations in <i>Drosophila</i> as a model organism, revealing how melatonin modulates locomotor activity and circadian integrity through specific alterations in metabolism.",Omics : a journal of integrative biology,2025,Apoorva Bhatnagar; Srishti Banerjee; Sandip Das; Saibal Saha; Greg Murray; Sandipan Ray
40560805,Differentiating Between Methylphenidate Use and Misuse: Clinical Insights From University Students and Academic Staff in Türkiye.,"BACKGROUND Methylphenidate (MPH) is widely prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but non-medical use is increasing, particularly in academic settings, for cognitive enhancement. This study aims to distinguish individuals using MPH for ADHD treatment from those misusing it by analyzing clinical and behavioral characteristics. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective study was conducted at a university-affiliated psychiatric outpatient clinic in Türkiye. Data were collected from structured psychiatric evaluations by a single psychiatrist between January and December 2024. A total of 135 individuals who requested MPH were included. Misuse was defined as use without an ADHD diagnosis, exceeding the prescribed dose, or use through non-oral routes. Participants were categorized into 4 groups based on diagnosis and misuse patterns. Data on demographics, psychiatric history, MPH use, and follow-up attendance were analyzed using descriptive and comparative methods. RESULTS Of the 135 participants, 3% were ADHD-diagnosed misusers, 33.3% were ADHD-diagnosed non-misusers, 11.9% were non-ADHD misusers, and 51.8% were non-ADHD non-misusers. Non-ADHD misusers were older (mean age 25 vs 22 years, P<0.001), had later MPH initiation (23 vs 15 years, P<0.001), more often held a PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) or an equivalent higher degree (23.3% vs 2.0%, P<0.001), had lower follow-up attendance (32.6% vs 93.9%, P<0.001), and preferred short-acting MPH (73.3% vs 20.4%, P<0.001). ADHD-diagnosed individuals were more likely to have a family psychiatric history (69.4% vs 21.0%, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Misuse patterns differ significantly from medically indicated use. Strengthening diagnostic accuracy and implementing effective monitoring protocols in academic settings are essential for preventing misuse and supporting ADHD treatment.",Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2025,Meltem Gürü
40560747,Early Onset Memory Deficit of WMI Rats Compared to Their Nearly Isogenic WLIs Is Reversed by Enriched Environment in Females.,"The underlying mechanisms of early onset memory deficit remain poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that environmental enrichment (EE) can attenuate early-onset cognitive decline in a novel genetic model, the Wistar Kyoto More Immobile (WMI) inbred rat strain, which manifests the risk factors of enhanced stress reactivity and depression-like behavior compared to its nearly isogenic control, the Wistar Kyoto Less Immobile strain (WLI). Middle-aged (12 months) WMI females exhibited dramatically diminished fear and spatial memory in the contextual fear conditioning and Morris Water Maze paradigms, respectively, compared to young females of both strains and to middle-aged WLI females. Middle-aged WMI males showed a lesser, but significant, age-induced deficit. EE from 6 to 12 months of age completely reversed the memory deficits in middle-aged WMI females and reversed age-induced decreases in plasma levels of estradiol. RNA sequencing from female hippocampi revealed significant strain, age, and enrichment-induced differentially expressed genes. Among these, solute carrier family 35, member A4 (Slc35a4) and potassium inwardly rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 2 (Kcnj2) were confirmed to show hippocampal expression changes parallel to that of memory in the WMI. These genes have critical roles in the integrated stress response, cellular metabolism, and the effects of stress on neurovascular coupling, respectively. Pathway analyses revealed the involvement of oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction in the hippocampal processes of aging and EE-induced reversal. These findings underscore the critical involvement of molecular stress responses in early-onset memory decline and suggest potential therapeutic targets for age-related cognitive impairment.","Genes, brain, and behavior",2025,Michelle T Ji; Katherine J Przybyl; Aspen M Harter; Mariya Nemesh; Sophia T Jenz; Anna Yamazaki; Chris Kim; Megan K Mulligan; Hao Chen; Eva E Redei
40560656,Effects of Health Shocks on Adult Children's Labor Market Outcomes and Well-Being.,"Using Norwegian administrative register data, we assess the impact of unexpected health shocks hitting lone parents on offspring's labor market outcomes and well-being. We use first-time hip fractures or strokes as indicators of parental health shocks and estimate both the overall effects and the heterogeneous impacts by the survival time of the affected parent. We identify small, but significant, immediate responses in terms of an increase in physician-certified sickness absences and a higher risk of diagnosed mental disorders. The short-term effects are larger for offspring whose parents die shortly after the shock. Most of the effects fade out quickly, and the negative impacts on subsequent employment and earnings are small and only borderline statistically significant. In general, our results suggest that the responses to the deteriorating health of a parent tend to be short-lived and mostly manifest as temporary absences from work rather than complete detachment from the labor market.",Health economics,2025,Eduardo Ramirez Lizardi; Elisabeth Fevang; Knut Røed; Henning Øien
40560615,Fluid dynamics model of the cerebral ventricular system.,"Hydrocephalus, a neurological condition characterized by an excessive buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain, affects millions worldwide and leads to severe consequences. Current treatments, such as ventriculoperitoneal shunts, divert excess CSF from the brain but often face complications, mainly due to shunt obstructions caused by biological matter accumulation. While previous shunt designs aimed to improve fluid flow and reduce occlusion, they often lacked the precision needed for real-world applications due to simplified simulation models that did not fully capture the dynamics of the cerebral ventricular system. Here, we introduce BrainFlow, a computational model that integrates detailed anatomical and physiological features to simulate CSF dynamics in the presence of shunt implants. BrainFlow incorporates patient-specific medical imaging data, pulsatile flow to mimic cardiac cycles, adjustable parameters for various hydrocephalus conditions, and a biomolecule tracking feature to evaluate the long-term risk of shunt occlusion due to flow-mediated biomolecular transport. This model provides a more nuanced understanding of the factors contributing to shunt obstruction, offering insights into optimal shunt placement, design, and materials choice. Through validation against four-dimensional MRI flow data, BrainFlow demonstrates robust accuracy across multiple flow metrics. Our work lays the groundwork for the development of next-generation shunts tailored to individual patient anatomy and pathology, ultimately aiming to improve hydrocephalus treatment through informed, patient-specific design strategies.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2025,Haritosh Patel; Yu Xuan Huang; Duygu Dengiz; Mariya Pravdivtseva; Olav Jansen; Eckhard Quandt; Joanna Aizenberg
40560586,Neurodevelopment Among Infants With Late-Onset Fetal Growth Restriction.,"Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, the delineation of neurodevelopmental sequela in late-onset FGR has been hampered by challenges in diagnosing late-onset FGR and the confounding influence of prematurity. To characterize neurodevelopmental outcomes in full-term infants exposed to late-onset FGR and to examine the association of FGR with fetal hemodynamics, perinatal brain development, and somatic growth. In this single-center cohort study, pregnant persons with fetuses small for gestational age were enrolled between April 1, 2010, and August 31, 2016, and followed up until the infant was 36 months of age. Follow-up was completed November 2019. Data analysis was performed from June to August 2024. Late-onset FGR diagnosed based on a composite scoring system. The primary outcomes were neurodevelopmental outcomes at 4, 8, and 12 months of age assessed by the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) and at 18 and 36 months of age assessed by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition. Secondary outcomes included fetal hemodynamics and perinatal brain development assessed by magnetic resonance imaging findings and serial somatic growth. Among 97 singleton pregnancies (mean [SD] maternal age, 33.5 [3.8] years; 50 [52%] male neonates), 41 neonates (42%) were exposed to late-onset FGR. At 12-month follow-up, motor development was significantly delayed among full-term infants exposed to late-onset FGR compared with neonates appropriate for gestational age (AIMS mean difference, -4.5; 95% CI, -8.6 to -0.3). At all other time points, neurodevelopmental outcomes were similar between the groups. In models adjusted for covariates, gestational age at birth was associated with 18-month cognitive outcomes (coefficient, 4.13 [95% CI, 0.54-7.72]), while the diagnosis of late-onset FGR was not. Preterm infants exposed to FGR exhibited higher fetal combined ventricular output, higher ratio of cerebral to pulmonary blood flow, and lower oxygen saturation compared with full-term infants exposed to FGR and infants with no FGR exposure. In general, neonatal brain maturation and somatic growth by 12 months of age were similar between full-term infants exposed to FGR and those with no exposure. However, head circumference was smaller from birth until the 36-month follow-up in infants exposed to FGR. In this cohort study, full-term infants exposed to late-onset FGR exhibited normal neurodevelopmental outcomes by 18 and 36 months of age, and longer gestation was associated with improved outcomes. These findings suggest that early delivery is unlikely to offer neurodevelopmental benefit, and any adverse impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes of late-onset FGR among full-term infants is likely to be modest.",JAMA network open,2025,Liqun Sun; Fu-Tsuen Lee; Natasha Milligan; Mengyuan Zhu; Joshua F P van Amerom; Brahmdeep S Saini; Jessie Mei Lim; Christopher K Macgowan; Edmond Kelly; John C Kingdom; Mike Seed
40560571,Serotonin neurons are necessary for tonic sodium intake inhibition.,"Sodium appetite is a motivated behavior that occurs in response to sodium deprivation. Various neurotransmitters, including serotonin, are thought to regulate sodium intake. In the present study, we used genetic deletion to test whether serotonergic neurons are necessary for regulating sodium appetite. First, we confirmed that <i>Pet1</i>-Cre; <i>Lmx1b</i><sup>flox/flox</sup> (<i>Lmx1b</i><sup>f/f/p</sup>) mice have nearly complete deletion of serotonergic neurons, with only sporadic cells remaining. Next, we measured baseline intake of water and 3% NaCl and found that <i>Lmx1b</i><sup>f/f/p</sup> mice consume more salt than Cre-negative littermate-control mice (<i>Lmx1b</i><sup>f/f</sup>). Finally, we tested the necessity of serotonergic neurons for thirst and sodium appetite inhibition. After 24-hour water deprivation, mice lacking serotonergic neurons exhibited an intact thirst response by increasing water intake just like Cre-negative littermates. After furosemide diuresis followed by 24-hour sodium deprivation mice lacking serotonergic neurons exhibited an intact sodium appetite response by increasing salt and water intake like Cre-negative littermates. Interestingly, the baseline, daily salt intake of <i>Lmx1b</i><sup>f/f/p</sup> mice increased between tests relative to their initial baseline. Together, these findings indicate that while serotonergic neurons are not the primary mechanism controlling sodium appetite, they act as a 'brake' limiting sodium consumption. This tonic inhibitory role may protect against excess sodium intake and suggests the possibility that serotonergic medications may influence dietary sodium consumption.","American journal of physiology.

40560555,"Polygenic Risk, Psychopathology, and Personalized Functional Brain Network Topography in Adolescence.","Functional brain networks are associated with both behavior and genetic factors. To uncover biological mechanisms of psychopathology, it is critical to define how the spatial organization of these networks relates to genetic risk during development. To determine the associations among transdiagnostic polygenic risk scores (PRSs), personalized functional brain networks (PFNs), and overall psychopathology (p-factor) during early adolescence. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study is an ongoing longitudinal cohort study of 21 collection sites across the US. This cross-sectional analysis includes ABCD baseline data collected between September 2016 and October 2018. The ABCD Study is a multisite community-based study. The sample is largely recruited through school systems. ABCD exclusion criteria included severe sensory, intellectual, medical, or neurological issues that interfere with protocol and scanner contraindications. Split-half subsets were used for cross-validation, matched on age, ethnicity, family structure, handedness, parental education, site, sex, and anesthesia exposure. Data were analyzed from January 2023 to July 2024. Polygenic risk scores of transdiagnostic genetic factors F1 (PRS-F1) and F2 (PRS-F2) derived from adults in Psychiatric Genomic Consortium and UK Biobanks datasets. PRS-F1 indexes liability for common psychiatric symptoms and disorders related to mood disturbance; PRS-F2 indexes liability for rarer forms of mental illness characterized by mania and psychosis. P-factor derived from bifactor models of youth- and parent-reported mental health assessments and person-specific functional brain network topography derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. Total participants included 11 873 children aged 9 to 10 years; 5678 (47.8%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 9.92 (0.62) years. PFN topography was found to be heritable (imaging subsample, n = 7459; 57.1% of vertices: mean h2, 0.35; false discovery rate-corrected P < .05). PRS-F1 was associated with p-factor (European ancestry subsample, n = 5815; r, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.09-0.15; P < .001). Interindividual differences in functional network topography were associated with p-factor (imaging subsample, n = 7459; mean r, 0.12), PRS-F1 (imaging and European ancestry subsample, n = 3982; mean r, 0.05), and PRS-F2 (n = 3982; mean r, 0.08). Cortical maps of p-factor and PRS-F1 regression coefficients were correlated (r, 0.70; P = .003, permutation test, N = 1000). Polygenic risk for transdiagnostic adulthood psychopathology was associated with both p-factor and heritable PFN topography during early adolescence in this study. These results may advance our understanding of the developmental drivers of psychopathology.",JAMA psychiatry,2025,Kevin Y Sun; J Eric Schmitt; Tyler M Moore; Ran Barzilay; Laura Almasy; Laura M Schultz; Allyson P Mackey; Eren Kafadar; Zhiqiang Sha; Jakob Seidlitz; Travis T Mallard; Zaixu Cui; Hongming Li; Yong Fan; Damien A Fair; Theodore D Satterthwaite; Arielle S Keller; Aaron Alexander-Bloch
40560524,"Molecular frontiers in hemodialysis: unraveling the role of membranes in gene expression, epigenetics, and inflammatory pathways.","Hemodialysis (HD) remains a vital treatment for patients with end-stage kidney disease, yet the characteristics of dialysis membranes significantly influence therapeutic outcomes. Membrane fouling, often caused by protein adherence, reduces toxin clearance and may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Recent studies have focused on modifying membrane chemistry to improve biocompatibility and reduce fouling. Although advancements have been made in understanding the biochemical and inflammatory responses during HD, the underlying molecular mechanisms, especially those involving epigenetic regulation remain incompletely understood. This review explores recent progress in HD treatment, with a specific emphasis on inflammation, gene expression, and epigenetic alterations. We examine how pro-inflammatory cytokines activate transcription factors that regulate gene expression and how genetic variability within inflammatory genes adds complexity to these pathways. In parallel, we assess emerging biocompatible membrane technologies designed to reduce adverse interactions with blood components, thereby enhancing patient safety and treatment efficiency. In addition, we discuss how genetic and epigenetic changes such as DNA mutations, methylation patterns, and histone modifications may influence patient responses to HD and contribute to complications, including mental health disorders such as depression. These insights support the development of personalized HD strategies tailored to the molecular and genetic profiles of individual patients. By integrating current findings from genetics, epigenetics, and gene expression studies, this review provides a comprehensive perspective on HD-related inflammation and molecular dysregulation. Our goal is to highlight key interconnections and identify critical knowledge gaps that must be addressed to improve long-term outcomes and quality of life for HD patients.",International urology and nephrology,2025,Hira Syeda; Victoria Doan; Ahmed Shoker; Amira Abdelrasoul
40560490,Ivermectin's neuroprotective effects decrease with prolonged use after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.,"Ivermectin (IVM), the recipient of the 2015 Nobel Prize, is an FDA-approved drug for a variety of parasitic diseases in animals and humans. However, the implications of this compound on neurological disorders remain inadequately elucidated. Recently, our research team has elucidated the neuroprotective properties of ivermectin administered in three doses following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (IR). The objective of the current investigation is to ascertain whether ivermectin sustains its neuroprotective properties through prolonged administration in models of cerebral IR in rats, as well as to evaluate its impact on the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). A rat model of transient global cerebral IR was induced by occluding both carotid arteries for 20 min. Ivermectin (2 mg/kg/day) was administered intraperitoneally one hour after the induction of cerebral ischemia for 7 consecutive days at 24-hour intervals. Then, the effects of ivermectin on brain infarct size, blood cell profile, bleeding time, memory and learning, balance and motor coordination, myeloperoxidase enzyme activity, and H3cit protein levels were investigated. The finding showed that the administration of ivermectin for 7 days did not improve memory and learning, blood parameters, or cerebral infarct size. However, it caused a 25.4% reduction in citrullinated histone protein level, decreased myeloperoxidase activity (P = 0.017), and improved balance and motor coordination (P = 0.017 and P = 0.024). In conclusion, our findings indicate that prolonged administration of ivermectin may diminish its neuroprotective effects and its effects can differ depending on the drug regimen.",Metabolic brain disease,2025,Sevda Rezaei; Shabnam Babataheri; Hamid Soraya
40560485,Clinical Implications of Antidepressants and Associated Risk of Bleeding: A Narrative Review.,"Antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), are widely prescribed for mental health disorders. These medications, however, are linked to increased bleeding risks related to inhibition of serotonin reuptake, which impairs platelet aggregation. The present investigation explores the pharmacodynamics of antidepressants, clinical evidence of bleeding complications, and strategies to manage these risks. While SSRIs and SNRIs pose the highest risk, tricyclic and atypical antidepressants show comparatively lower bleeding incidences. The concomitant use of anticoagulants, NSAIDs, or antiplatelet agents significantly amplifies bleeding risk. Current guidelines stress individualized risk assessment, alternative drug selection, and preventive measures, such as gastroprotective agents. Future research may offer novel approaches to mitigate bleeding while maintaining therapeutic efficacy, ensuring the safety of antidepressants in clinical practices.",Current pain and headache reports,2025,Alan D Kaye; Harrison D Cooper; Sydney A Mashaw; Ahmed I Anwar; Alex V Hollander; Austin S Thomassen; Anushka Singh; Sahar Shekoohi
40560479,The Pathogenesis of Papilledema: Review of the Literature and a New Hypothesis.,"Since the first description of swelling of the optic nerve head in patients with increased intracranial pressure, our understanding of its pathogenesis has undergone significant changes. Early theories postulated that the swelling was caused by excessive extracellular fluid, but these views were disproved when electron microscopy showed that the swelling arose from dilated optic nerve axons, and autoradiography demonstrated blocked axonal transport at the posterior lamina cribrosa. This led to the currently prevailing view that the axonal swelling is caused by the damming back of axoplasm. However, this theory cannot account for the extent of swelling, its rate of development, and the variety of morphological changes in papilledema. It also cannot explain the differing patterns of swelling in papilledema and acute glaucoma despite identically located blockages of axonal transport. We conducted a biomechanical analysis, in which we calculated the stresses induced in a cylindrical nerve by external compression and the effect of these stresses on the nerve's axons and the axoplasm within them. We propose a new theory in which the axial gradient of tissue pressure causes displacement of axoplasm from the extraocular to the intraocular segment of the nerve, accounting for the intraocular axonal swelling. In addition, a sharply localized axial shear stress disrupts the axonal cytoskeleton to block axonal transport. Although the pressure gradient and the shear stress are both caused by the external compression of the nerve, they differ in their relative magnitudes across the nerve cross-section. The proposed hypothesis resolves the difficulties with the damming back hypothesis.",Bulletin of mathematical biology,2025,David N Levine; Ari I Rapalino
40560468,Regional free-water diffusion is more strongly related to neuroinflammation than neurodegeneration.,"Recent research has suggested that neuroinflammation may be important in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Free-water diffusion (FWD) has been proposed as a non-invasive neuroimaging-based biomarker for neuroinflammation. Free-water maps were generated using diffusion MRI data in 367 patients from the Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative (108 Alzheimer's Disease/Mild Cognitive Impairment, 42 Frontotemporal Dementia, 37 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, 123 Parkinson's Disease, and 58 vascular disease-related Cognitive Impairment). The ability of FWD to predict neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration from biofluids was estimated using plasma glial fibrillary-associated protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NfL), respectively. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) performed the strongest out of all feature selection algorithms used and revealed regional specificity for areas that are the most important features for predicting GFAP over NfL concentration. Deep learning models using selected features and demographic information revealed better prediction of GFAP over NfL. Based on feature selection and deep learning methods, FWD was found to be more strongly related to GFAP concentration (measure of astrogliosis) over NfL (measure of neuro-axonal damage), across neurodegenerative disease groups, in terms of predictive performance. Non-invasive markers of neurodegeneration such as MRI structural imaging that can reveal neurodegeneration already exist, while non-invasive markers of neuroinflammation are not available. Our results support the use of FWD as a non-invasive neuroimaging-based biomarker for neuroinflammation.",Journal of neurology,2025,Vishaal Sumra; Mohsen Hadian; Allison A Dilliott; Sali M K Farhan; Andrew R Frank; Anthony E Lang; Angela C Roberts; Angela Troyer; Stephen R Arnott; Connie Marras; David F Tang-Wai; Elizabeth Finger; Ekaterina Rogaeva; Joseph B Orange; Joel Ramirez; Lorne Zinman; Malcolm Binns; Michael Borrie; Morris Freedman; Miracle Ozzoude; Robert Bartha; Richard H Swartz; David Munoz; Mario Masellis; Sandra E Black; Roger A Dixon; Dar Dowlatshahi; David Grimes; Ayman Hassan; Robert A Hegele; Sanjeev Kumar; Stephen Pasternak; Bruce Pollock; Tarek Rajji; Demetrios Sahlas; Gustavo Saposnik; Maria Carmela Tartaglia

In the recent past, a growing body of scientific research has begun to shed light on the critical involvement of the neuro-immune axis in the onset and advancement of these debilitating conditions. This comprehensive review article delves into the intricate composition of the neuro-immune axis, elucidating the complex mechanisms through which it exerts its influence in the context of neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, it explores the potential therapeutic applications of targeting the neuro-immune axis for the management and treatment of these diseases. This extensive examination aims to offer new perspectives and innovative strategies that could pave the way for more effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, thereby providing hope for those afflicted by these challenging conditions.",Neuroscience bulletin,2025,Tingting Liu; Haojie Wu; Jianshe Wei
40560457,Peripheral neuroblastic tumors: tumor biology and its implications for risk stratification.,"Peripheral neuroblastic tumor (pNT) is a pediatric tumor that originates from the sympathetic nervous system and is the most common extracranial solid malignancy found in children. It is characterized by its clinical and biological heterogeneity. Therefore, an International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system was developed to create a standardized approach for pretreatment risk stratification. This system considers several factors, including the patient's age, tumor histology, the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Staging System (INRGSS), DNA ploidy, the presence or absence of MYCN gene amplification in tumor cells, and segmental chromosomal aberrations, particularly the 11q aberration. In this review, we summarize the biological characteristics of peripheral neuroblastic tumors. We present their histopathological features, outline the different prognostic groups, discuss various molecular markers, and emphasize the importance of the risk stratification system in optimizing treatment.",European journal of pediatrics,2025,Aroua Anissi Eddaibouni; Sanaa Hachimi; Nisrine Bennani Guebessi; Siham Cherkaoui; Mehdi Karkouri
40560423,Epilepsy Prediction via Time-Frequency Features and Multi-Scale Hybrid Neural Networks.,"The prediction of epileptic seizures heavily depends on the precise embedding and classification of complex, multi-dimensional electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Due to individual variability and the dynamic non-linear nature of EEG signals, extracting highly discriminative spatiotemporal features is a core challenge in this field. In this study, to address this issue, we proposed a novel architecture based on the Epilepsy Prediction using Multi-Scale Hybrid Neural Network (EPM-HNN), which integrates adaptive channel weighting, multi-scale spatial feature extraction, and bidirectional temporal dependency modeling. Specifically, we incorporated a sliding window mechanism with spatiotemporal resolution into the feature extraction process, enhancing the model's sensitivity to neural dynamics across frequency bands and improving its ability to capture micro-patterns. We used the Res2Net-50 multi-scale feature extractor to enhance the convolutional neural network's capacity to process complex local micro-features, such as polyspike-and-slow-wave complexes. Additionally, we introduced Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet) to adaptively capture potential effective features between different EEG channels. This dynamic weighting mechanism based on adaptive attention demonstrates strong robustness and high generalization across individual subject data. Furthermore, we proposed a non-single-subject, non-specific cross-subject training and testing method, demonstrating its ability to combat overfitting when addressing differences in data distribution. Experiments on the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset achieved an overall prediction accuracy of 97.7%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed EPM-HNN architecture.",Journal of medical systems,2025,Wenwen Chang; Bingyang Ji; Dandan Li; Lei Zhen; Yaxuan Wei; Xuan Liu; Guanghui Yan
40560390,[Youth mental health: early detection and early intervention of mental disorders].,"Mental diseases occur particularly frequently between the ages of 12 and 25 years, with important implications for the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment. Against this background this article outlines a youth mental health paradigm which prioritizes the early detection, early intervention and prevention of mental disorders, e.g., psychoses, bipolar disorders and personality disorders in adolescence. The first part of the article summarizes the findings for sensitive phases during brain development, which indicate the elevated plasticity of neural circuits during youth that can be used for preventive interventions. The interactions between risk and resilience factors and ongoing brain development are an essential reason for the frequent occurrence of mental disorders between 12-25 years. Furthermore, innovative diagnostic approaches, such as clinical staging models, are proposed that are a prerequisite for early detection and early intervention. In this context, low-threshold service modelss and age-appropriate interventions, such as digital approaches, are necessary to improve access to care in youths. Taken together, a ""youth mental health"" paradigm could significantly enhance mental health in young people and initiate a shift towards the prevention of severe mental disorders.",Der Nervenarzt,2025,Peter J Uhlhaas; Andreas Bechdolf; Kerstin Konrad; Nikolaos Koutsouleris; Eva Meisenzahl; Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg; Ulrich Reininghaus; Christoph U Correll

40560244,Phytochemicals as modulators of ferroptosis: a novel therapeutic avenue in cancer and neurodegeneration.,"Ferroptosis, a controlled cell death mechanism characterised by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, has become a significant factor in the pathophysiology of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Its dual role as a tumor suppressor and mediator of neuronal damage highlights its significance as a therapeutic target. Phytochemicals, natural bioactive molecules in plants, have attracted interest for their ability to modulate ferroptosis through diverse mechanisms, including regulation of oxidative stress, iron metabolism, and antioxidant defense systems. This review examines the complex relationship between ferroptosis and disease mechanisms, emphasizing its relevance in treatment-resistant cancers and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Information was taken from reputable databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. We thoroughly analyzed the current evidence on phytochemicals-including polyphenols like curcumin and epigallocatechin gallate, flavonoids like quercetin and luteolin, and alkaloids like berberine-as modulators of ferroptotic pathways. Despite their promising therapeutic potential, challenges such as limited bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and clinical validation remain significant hurdles. Future research focusing on advanced delivery systems, synergistic approaches, and personalized medicine strategies could unlock the full potential of phytochemicals in ferroptosis-targeted therapies. This review underscores phytochemicals as a novel and versatile avenue in addressing the unmet therapeutic needs in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.",Molecular biology reports,2025,Esther Ugo Alum; Ada Ak Akwari; Prince Nkemakolam Okoroh; Ugonna Cassandra Aniokete; Jacinta Nnennaya Abba; Daniel Ejim Uti
40560091,Where Does It All Itch? Exploring the Characteristics of Pruritus in Small Fiber Neuropathy.,"Chronic itch, or pruritus, is a common discomfort of the skin. Chronic itch has been described as a symptom of small fiber neuropathy (SFN), a disorder affecting the small myelinated Aδ- and unmyelinated C-fibers. While prior studies report itch rates in SFN ranging from 63%-68%, a distinct pattern has not been identified. This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of itch in a large cohort of SFN patients. Between May 2016 and August 2022, 1415 patients filled out an exploratory questionnaire about characteristics of their itch symptoms. 83% were diagnosed with SFN based on the Besta criteria. Itch was reported in 66% of SFN patients, mainly experienced as tickling, prickling, and tingling sensations. Itch was most common in the evening, with 98% reporting continuous or episodic symptoms during this time. The itch was predominantly localized to the distal extremities, especially the lower legs and feet (over 50% of patients), with additional reports on the back (25%) and face (27%). Unlike the typical stocking-glove distribution seen with neuropathic pain, itch showed a slightly more proximal locus. SFN patients were more likely to report itching in the hands and feet than non-SFN patients. This study reveals that itch in SFN is a frequent, heterogeneous symptom that may differ from neuropathic pain in its distribution. Itch, particularly in the hands and feet, may provide diagnostic guidance and suggest SFN as a potential diagnosis. This finding warrants further research on itch mechanisms and its diagnostic value in SFN.",Journal of the peripheral nervous system : JPNS,2025,Dennis Kool; Janneke G J Hoeijmakers; Catharina G Faber; Ingemar S J Merkies
40560089,Leveraging big electronic data to identify oral care disparities in individuals with serious mental illness.,"Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) have poorer oral health than the general population for various reasons, including poor oral hygiene, adverse effects of psychotropic medicines, stigma, fear, cognitive impairment, lack of insur¬ance coverage, and a shortage of professionals qualified to manage the oral health needs of this population. Oral health deteriorates further when care is postponed, resulting in greater treatment needs when the patient visits the dental office. This retrospective study aimed to determine differ¬ences in service return rate and frequency of visits for each of 12 American Dental Association (ADA) oral procedures in patients with and without SMI who were treated in a predoctoral dental clinic at a northeastern US dental school. This retrospective study used the dental electronic health records of 12,138 adult patients aged 18 years and over (total of 19,096 unique patient encounters) who received at least 1 comprehensive oral evaluation between January 1, 2017, and August 31, 2021. Three data processing methods were implemented to retrieve periodontal diagnoses in accordance with American Academy of Periodontology guidelines and to extract medical histories and behavioral factors from free text. Chi-square tests determined that there were statistically significant differences between the 2 groups for 4 of 12 ADA procedures, while t tests deter¬mined that the SMI group had a higher frequency of visits for 6 procedure categories. Logistic regression analysis showed that patients with an SMI had a significantly higher odds ratio of receiving 2 procedure categories (remov¬able prosthodontics and adjunctive general services). A negative binomial regression analysis was then conducted to predict the frequency of visits; patients with an SMI had a higher incidence rate ratio of receiving 4 ADA procedure categories (preventive, removable prosthodontics, oral and maxillofacial surgery, and adjunctive general services). This study identified the existence of oral healthcare disparities in a population with SMI in relation to specific ADA dental procedure categories. Improving integrated care models, interprofessional collaboration, and education of predoc¬toral dental students and licensed professionals may help alleviate some of the existing disparities.",General dentistry,2025,Vaishali Singhal; Yuane Jia; Ni Gao; Jill York; Michael Gold-Rosenbach; Nysa Ginu; Rhea Arya; Jay Sureshbhai Patel
40560063,Peripheral Neuropathy as an Early Marker in Newborn-Screened Krabbe Disease: The Value of Pre-Confirmatory Neurophysiological Testing.,"Krabbe disease, or globoid cell leukodystrophy, is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme galactosylceramidase (GALC). This deficiency leads to the toxic accumulation of psychosine, resulting in progressive demyelination and neuronal death. The clinical manifestations of Krabbe disease progress through different stages, starting with irritability, stiffness, and feeding difficulties, followed by myoclonic-like jerks in the upper and lower extremities, hypertonicity, and eventually severe hypotonia and lack of movement. This case report features two newborn screening patients with (NBS)-positive Krabbe disease who underwent electrodiagnostic (EDX) testing and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) soon after birth. The EDX results indicated severe sensory-motor polyneuropathy of mixed demyelinating and axonal types. Biochemical analyses confirmed significantly reduced GALC enzyme activity and elevated psychosine levels in both cases. Genetic testing identified pathogenic variants, including compound heterozygous deletions and mutations within the GALC gene. At 6-month follow-up post-HSCT, one patient showed age-appropriate milestones and improvement in motor amplitudes on repeat nerve conduction studies. EDX testing is helpful in assessing NBS-positive Krabbe disease before confirmatory testing results become available. In conjunction with genetic confirmation and GALC enzyme levels, EDX test results were useful to counsel families that their seemingly normal newborn has severe disease and facilitated discussion toward timely treatment with HSCT. We suggest that EDX be included in the initial and follow-up evaluation of patients with Krabbe disease undergoing HSCT.",Journal of the peripheral nervous system : JPNS,2025,Anthara Gnanakumar; Rana Aljaberi; Dawn A Laney; Christian Martin; Stephanie R Keller; Suhag H Parikh; Sumit Verma
40560017,Longitudinal Overlap and Metabolite Analysis in Spectroscopic MRI-Guided Proton Beam Therapy in Pediatric High-Grade Glioma.,"Pediatric high-grade glioma (pHGG) is a highly aggressive cancer with unique biology distinct from adult high-grade glioma, limiting the effectiveness of standard treatment protocols derived from adult research. The purpose of this report is to present preliminary results from an ongoing pilot study integrating spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) to guide proton beam therapy and longitudinal imaging analysis in pediatric patients with high-grade glioma (pHGG). Thirteen pediatric patients under 21 years old with supratentorial WHO grade III-IV glioma underwent baseline and serial whole-brain spectroscopic MRI alongside standard structural MRIs. Radiation targets were defined using T1-weighted contrast enhanced, T2-FLAIR, and Cho/NAA ≥ 2X maps. Longitudinal analyses included voxel-level metabolic change maps and spatial overlap metrics comparing pre-proton therapy and post-. Six patients had sufficient longitudinal data; five received sMRI-guided PBT. Significant positive correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.89, <i>p</i> < 0.0001) was observed between T2-FLAIR and Cho/NAA ≥ 2X volumes. Voxel-level difference maps of Cho/NAA and Choline revealed dynamic metabolic changes across follow-up scans. Analyzing Cho/NAA and Cho changes over time allowed differentiation between true progression and pseudoprogression, which conventional MRI alone struggles to achieve. Longitudinal sMRI enhanced metabolic tracking in pHGG, detects early tumor changes, and refines RT targeting beyond structural imaging. This first in-kind study highlights the potential of sMRI biomarkers in tracking treatment effects and emphasizes the complementary roles of metabolic and radiographic metrics in evaluating therapy response in pHGG.","Tomography (Ann Arbor, Mich.)",2025,Abinand C Rejimon; Anuradha G Trivedi; Vicki Huang; Karthik K Ramesh; Natia Esiashvilli; Eduard Schreibmann; Hyunsuk Shim; Kartik Reddy; Bree R Eaton
40560014,Applications of Advanced Imaging for Radiotherapy Planning and Response Assessment in the Central Nervous System.,"Radiotherapy for tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) could be improved by incorporating advanced imaging techniques into treatment planning and response assessment. The objective of this narrative review is to highlight the recent developments in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) for applications in CNS radiotherapy. Recent articles were selected for discussion, covering the following topics: advanced imaging on MRI-linear accelerators for early response assessment in glioma; PET for guiding treatment planning and response assessment in glioma; and contrast-enhanced imaging and metabolic imaging for differentiating tumor progression and radiation necrosis for brain metastasis treatment. Where necessary, searches of scholarly databases (e.g., Google Scholar, PubMed) were used to find papers for each topic. The topics were chosen based on the perception of promise in advancing specific applications of CNS radiotherapy and not covered in detail elsewhere. This review is not intended to be comprehensive. Advanced MRI sequences and PET could have a substantial impact on CNS radiotherapy. For gliomas, the tumor response to therapy could be assessed much earlier than using the conventional technique of measuring changes in tumor size. Using advanced imaging on combined imaging/therapy devices like MR-Linacs would enable response monitoring throughout radiotherapy. For brain metastases, radiation necrosis and tumor progression might be reliably differentiated with imaging techniques sensitive to perfusion or metabolism. However, the lack of level 1 evidence supporting specific uses for each imaging technique is an impediment to widespread use. Advanced MRI and PET have great promise to change the standard of care for CNS radiotherapy, but clinical trials validating specific applications are needed.","Tomography (Ann Arbor, Mich.)",2025,Liam S P Lawrence; Rachel W Chan; Amit Singnurkar; Jay Detsky; Chris Heyn; Pejman J Maralani; Hany Soliman; Greg J Stanisz; Arjun Sahgal; Angus Z Lau
40560010,"Role of Amide Proton Transfer Weighted MRI in Predicting MGMTp Methylation Status, p53-Status, Ki-67 Index, IDH-Status, and ATRX Expression in WHO Grade 4 High Grade Glioma.","<b>Objectives:</b> To assess amide proton transfer weighted (APTw) MR imaging capabilities in differentiating high-grade glial tumors across alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked (ATRX) expression, tumor-suppressor protein p53 expression (p53), O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter (MGMTp) methylation, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status, and proliferation marker Ki-67 (Ki-67 index) as a preoperative diagnostic aid. <b>Material & Methods:</b> A total of 42 high-grade glioma WHO grade 4 (HGG) patients were evaluated prospectively (30 males and 12 females). All patients were examined using conventional MRI, including the following: T1w-MPRAGE pre- and post-contrast administration, conventional T2w and 3D FLAIR, and APTw imaging with a 3T MR scanner. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated for the APTw% mean, median, and max signal for the different molecular biomarkers. A logistic regression model was constructed for combined mean and median APTw% signals for p53 expression. <b>Results:</b> The whole-tumor max APTw% signal could significantly differentiate MGMTp from non-MGMTp HGG, <i>p</i> = 0.035. A cutoff of 4.28% max APTw% signal yielded AUC (area under the curve) = 0.702, with 70.6% sensitivity and 66.7% specificity. The mean/median APTw% signals differed significantly in p53 normal versus p53-overexpressed HGG s: 1.81%/1.83% vs. 1.15%/1.18%, <i>p</i> = 0.002/0.006, respectively. Cutoffs of 1.25%/1.33% for the mean/median APTw% signals yielded AUCs of 0.786/0.757, sensitivities of 76.9%/76.9%, and specificities of 50%/66.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.002/0.006, respectively. A logistic regression model with a combined mean and median APTw% signal for p53 status yielded an AUC = 0.788 and 76.9% sensitivity and 66.2% specificity. ATRX-, IDH- wild type (wt) vs. mutation (mut), and the level of Ki-67 did not differ significantly, but trends were found: IDH-wt and low Ki-67 showed higher mean/median/max APTw% signals vs. IDH-mut and high Ki-67, respectively. ATRX-wt vs. mutation showed higher mean and median APTw% signals but lower max APTw% signal. <b>Conclusions</b>: APTw imaging can potentially be a useful marker for the stratification of p53 expression and MGMT status in high-grade glioma in the preoperative setting and potentially aid surgical decision-making.","Tomography (Ann Arbor, Mich.)",2025,Faris Durmo; Jimmy Lätt; Anna Rydelius; Elisabet Englund; Tim Salomonsson; Patrick Liebig; Johan Bengzon; Peter C M van Zijl; Linda Knutsson; Pia C Sundgren
40560007,The Image Clarity Paradox: Higher CZT SPECT Contrast Does Not Always Translate to Diagnostic Accuracy for Alzheimer's Disease.,"<b>Background</b>: Recent advances in single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) technology, particularly cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) detectors, have improved spatial resolution and contrast in cerebral blood flow imaging. This study aimed to investigate whether these improvements translate to enhanced diagnostic accuracy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). <b>Methods</b>: We compared conventional SPECT (eCAM) with CZT SPECT in 29 patients (mean age 60.9 ± 17.6 years, 69% female) with suspected neurodegenerative diseases. <b>Results</b>: Gray matter/white matter contrast was significantly higher in CZT SPECT compared to eCAM (1.615 ± 0.096 vs. 1.458 ± 0.068, <i>p</i> < 0.001). However, diagnostic accuracy for AD did not improve with CZT SPECT. For the participating psychiatrist, sensitivity decreased from 0.750 (eCAM) to 0.625 (CZT), while for the radiologist, specificity dropped from 0.571 (eCAM) to 0.429 (CZT). Overall accuracy slightly decreased for both readers. <b>Conclusions</b>: These findings suggest that while CZT SPECT offers superior image quality, it may not immediately translate to improved diagnostic accuracy for AD. The study highlights the importance of specialized training for clinicians in interpreting higher-resolution CZT SPECT images to fully leverage their potential in neurodegenerative disease diagnosis. Future research should focus on developing standardized training protocols and larger, multi-center studies to validate these findings.","Tomography (Ann Arbor, Mich.)",2025,Kiyotaka Nemoto; Bryan J Mathis; Akemi Iwasaka; Kenjiro Nakayama; Tomohiro Kaneta; Tetsuaki Arai
40559938,Hippocampal Proteomics Reveals the Novel Molecular Profiling of Postnatal Lead (Pb) Exposure on Autism-like Behaviors.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a multifactorial neurodevelopmental disorder, with lead (Pb) exposure increasingly linked to its risk. However, the molecular mechanisms linking Pb to ASD remain poorly understood. This study established a postnatal Pb-exposed mouse model and employed the three-chamber social test and the marble-burying test to assess ASD-like behavioral phenotypes. The Pb levels in both blood and the hippocampus were quantified, and hippocampal neurons were assessed for morphological alterations. Moreover, a Tandem Mass Tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics approach was applied to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Neurobehavioral experiments revealed Pb-exposed C57BL/6 offspring exhibited reduced social interaction and novelty preference along with increased repetitive marble-burying behavior. The Pb levels in both the blood and hippocampus of Pb-treated mice were significantly elevated compared with those of control animals. Postnatal Pb exposure resulted in a reduction in the neuronal numbers and disorganized neuronal arrangement in the hippocampus. A total of 66 proteins were identified as being differentially expressed after postnatal Pb exposure. Among them, 34 differentially expressed proteins were common in both Pb exposure groups, with 33 downregulated and 1 upregulated. Bioinformatic analysis revealed multi-pathway regulation involved in Pb-induced neurodevelopmental disorders, including dysregulation of synaptic signaling, abnormal activation of neuron apoptosis, and neuroinflammation.

40559877,Dual-Toxin-Producing <i>Clostridium botulinum</i> Strain Isolated from a Foodborne Botulism Case in Korea: Genomic and Functional Insights.,"<i>Clostridium botulinum</i> produces one of the most potent biological toxins and causes botulism, a rare but potentially fatal neuroparalytic disease. In 2014, a foodborne botulism case was reported in Korea, and a strain (CB-2014001) was isolated. Initial characterization identified it as a BoNT/B-producing strain based on mouse bioassay and conventional PCR. However, subsequent genomic analysis revealed the presence of dual BoNT gene clusters, bont/B and bont/F, corresponding to subtypes B5 and F2, respectively. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the genetic characteristics and toxin expression profiles of the isolated strain. The strain showed high sequence identity with Bf-type strains such as CDC 3281 and An436. Functional assays confirmed simultaneous expression of both BoNT/B and /F toxins at 35 °C, and temperature-dependent assays revealed predominant expression of BoNT/F at 30 °C and BoNT/B at 37 °C, indicating that toxin expression is influenced by environmental temperature. These findings highlight the potential for differential pathogenicity based on culture conditions and underscore the importance of developing diagnostic tools capable of detecting multiple <i>bont</i> genes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a dual-toxin-producing <i>C. botulinum</i> strain associated with foodborne botulism in Korea, providing important insights into botulism diagnosis, treatment strategies, and public health preparedness.",Toxins,2025,Eun-Sun Choi; Chi-Hwan Choi; Jun-Ho Jeon; So-Hyeon Kim; Hyun-Ju Song; Hwajung Yi; Gi-Eun Rhie; Yoon-Seok Chung
40559870,Patient Satisfaction with Aesthetic Outcomes Following OnabotulinumtoxinA Treatment for Chronic Migraine: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"OnabotulinumtoxinA (OnaBoNT-A) is approved for chronic migraine prevention and follows the PREEMPT protocol with injections in the glabellar and forehead regions. While aesthetic changes are considered a side effect, their effect on patient satisfaction has not been thoroughly assessed. This study evaluated patient satisfaction with facial aesthetic outcomes after repeated OnaBoNT-A treatment for chronic migraine. Conducted at specialist headache centers, it included adult patients with chronic migraine who had received at least three OnaBoNT-A cycles. Participants completed a structured questionnaire on demographics, migraine history, facial wrinkles and age perception, appearance satisfaction, psychological impact, treatment satisfaction, and adverse aesthetic events. A total of 124 patients (92.7% female; median age 42.5 years) participated. OnaBoNT-A reduced wrinkle severity (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Most patients (74.2%) reported aesthetic improvement post-treatment. The majority of patients (76.7%) declared that treatment met or exceeded expectations. 32% reported looking younger post-treatment, with a median perceived age difference of 5 years. Adverse event frequency was similar to pivotal trial outcomes, mostly mild, with no treatment discontinuations. OnaBoNT-A for chronic migraine, following the PREEMPT protocol, provides significant therapeutic benefits and high patient satisfaction regarding aesthetic outcomes. Although aesthetic side effects were generally mild, they were not uncommon.",Toxins,2025,Magdalena Boczarska-Jedynak; Marta Bott-Karoń; Karol Marschollek; Mariola Antolak; Maciej Świat; Marta Waliszewska-Prosół
40559867,Clinical Efficacy of Bladder Neck Injection of Botulinum Toxin A in Treating Neurogenic and Non-Neurogenic Voiding Dysfunctions Due to Bladder Neck Dysfunction.,"Bladder neck dysfunction (BND) is a pathophysiology associated with voiding dysfunction in patients with neurogenic or non-neurogenic voiding dysfunction. Botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) injection is a minimally invasive alternative for treating bladder outlet dysfunction; however, its efficacy for BND has not been well established. In this retrospective study, 41 patients with videourodynamic study-confirmed BND who failed medical therapy received a transurethral bladder neck injection of 100-U BoNT-A. Treatment outcomes were assessed using the Global Response Assessment. After BoNT-A injection, the patients were followed up and subsequent urological management was recorded. At 6 months, 65.9% of the patients reported satisfactory outcomes (26.8% successful and 39.0% improved). Patients with non-neurogenic BND had the highest satisfaction rate, higher than those with neurogenic BND (NBND) with and without detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (DSD). Among patients without detrusor acontractility (DA), a higher bladder outlet obstruction index predicted treatment failure. Patients with pure BND confirmed by urodynamics may benefit more from BoNT-A injections, whereas those with high baseline voiding detrusor pressure or spinal cord injury with detrusor sphincter dyssynergia may have less favorable results. Bladder neck BoNT-A injections for treating BND-associated voiding dysfunction did not achieve very successful outcomes. Only 26.8% of the patients had successful treatment outcomes, while 39.0% had improved outcomes and 34.1% failed the treatment.",Toxins,2025,Yu-Shuang Lee; Yu-Khun Lee; Tien-Lin Chang; Cheng-Ling Lee; Sheng-Fu Chen; Jia-Fong Jhang; Yuan-Hong Jiang; Hann-Chorng Kuo

40559842,Unveiling the Neurotoxic Effects of Ochratoxin A and Its Impact on Neuroinflammation.,"Ochratoxin A (OTA), a toxic compound generated by <i>Aspergillus</i> and <i>Penicillium</i> fungi, is a common contaminant in different food and animal feed sources, thereby posing possible dangers to human well-being. Although OTA is widely recognized for its kidney-damaging properties, new findings have also indicated its potential to harm the nervous system. Current research trends have increasingly examined the part played by environmental poisons, such as mycotoxins, in the development of diseases. This systematic review gathers and assesses the features of OTA along with the insights acquired from studies on its neurotoxicity. This work presents recent research that demonstrates some mechanisms by which OTA crosses the intestinal and blood-brain barriers, penetrating neural structures. In addition, it discusses the effect of OTA on several types of neural cells and its roles in apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and neurogenesis defects, while also determining the effects of antioxidant systems that neutralize the effects of OTA. This paper identifies crucial gaps in the research and highlights the necessity for further in-depth studies into how OTA affects the processes underlying neurodegeneration. Filling these knowledge gaps could provide valuable insights into the neurotoxic potential of OTA and its relevance to neurological disorders.",Toxins,2025,María Ángeles García-Esparza; Eva María Mateo; José Antonio Robles; Michela Capoferri; Misericordia Jiménez; José Miguel Soria
40559778,Faecal Microbiota Transplantation as an Adjuvant Treatment for Extraintestinal Disorders: Translating Insights from Human Medicine to Veterinary Practice.,"Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has emerged as a transformative therapy in human medicine, particularly for managing recurrent <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infections and other gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. Beyond the GI tract, FMT has shown potential in addressing extraintestinal conditions in people, including metabolic, immune-mediated, dermatological, neurological, and infectious diseases. Research in people has highlighted its efficacy in decolonising multidrug-resistant organisms in infection, mitigating autoimmune diseases, and improving outcomes in metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes. Furthermore, FMT has also been linked to enhanced responses to immunotherapy in cancer and improved management of hepatic and renal conditions. These findings underscore the intricate connections between the gut microbiome and systemic health, opening novel therapeutic avenues. In veterinary medicine, while FMT has demonstrated benefits for GI disorders, its application in extraintestinal diseases remains largely unexplored. Emerging evidence suggests that conditions such as atopic dermatitis, chronic kidney disease, immune-mediated diseases, and behavioural disorders in companion animals could benefit from microbiome-targeted therapies. However, significant gaps in knowledge persist, particularly regarding the long-term safety and efficacy for veterinary applications. This review synthesises findings from human medicine to assess their relevance for veterinary applications and future research.",Veterinary sciences,2025,Alice Nishigaki; Julian R Marchesi; Renato L Previdelli
40559706,"Inflammatory, White Matter, and Neurodegenerative Mechanisms in Fluid Ability Decrements in Chronic Mild-to-Moderate Traumatic Brain Injury.","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects millions globally each year, with mild TBI comprising about 75% of cases. While most mild TBI symptoms are resolved within 3 months, some patients experience persistent issues. This study aimed to identify underlying mechanisms contributing to decrements in fluid cognitive abilities in chronic (>6 months) mild-to-moderate TBI. Specifically, the study focused on the relationships between cognitive performance, white matter integrity, TBI-related symptoms, and blood biomarkers, which are thought to be indicative of biological processes including neuronal injury (neurofilament light [NF-L], neurofilament heavy, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1), vascular injury (vascular endothelial growth factor A), glial injury (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), neurodegeneration (tau, phosphorylated-tau), immune response (GFAP immunoglobulin G), and inflammation (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin [IL]-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, interferon-γ, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α). The final study sample included 57 participants (42 males, 15 females) aged 19-59 with a history of chronic, remote mild-to-moderate TBI. Participants underwent cognitive and behavioral testing, neuroimaging, and a blood draw. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess white matter integrity in tracts connecting frontal and parietal regions with fractional anisotropy utilized as the metric. Blood samples were analyzed for TBI-related biomarkers. The study found that higher fluid cognition scores were associated with higher white matter integrity in frontal-parietal networks, fewer reported TBI-related symptoms, and mixed biomarker and cytokine levels. Inflammatory processes were linked to lower fractional anisotropy in white matter pathways, more reported symptoms, and increased biomarkers of injury. Higher white matter integrity was also associated with fewer reported neurobehavioral symptoms. The findings provide evidence for a complex interplay of ongoing neuroinflammatory processes, white matter integrity, symptomology, and cognitive function in chronic mild-to-moderate TBI. The results underscore the importance of considering both structural brain changes and systemic responses in understanding the long-term effects of TBI. The observed correlations between cognitive deficits, white matter disruptions, and biomarker profiles suggest potential avenues for targeted interventions aimed at mitigating these effects in TBI patients.",Journal of neurotrauma,2025,Samantha H Penhale; Abigail B Waters; Shoumi Sarkar; Leah E McQuillan; John Maczuzak; Somnath Datta; Damon Lamb; Claudia Robertson; Richard Rubenstein; Amy K Wagner; Firas Kobeissy; Kevin K W Wang; John B Williamson
40559659,Rhamnan Sulfate from the Seaweed <i>Monostroma nitidum</i> May Improve Cognitive Impairment Caused by Hyperglycemia.,"Rhamnan sulfate (RS), extracted from the seaweed <i>Monostroma nitidum</i>, suppresses vascular endothelial inflammation and arteriosclerosis, decreases blood glucose levels, and improves blood lipid metabolism and the intestinal environment. We examined whether RS improves hyperglycemia-induced cognitive decline in a hyperglycemic mouse model pretreated with nicotinamide and streptozotocin and then orally administered a high-fat diet and maltodextrin (MD) for 4 months. RS was administered in an MD solution at doses of 75, 225, and 750 mg/kg of mouse body weight. Administration of RS to hyperglycemic mice significantly reduced blood glucose levels and tended to improve memory function in behavioral pharmacological tests using spontaneous locomotor activity, rotarod test, and eight-way-maze test, although the results were not significant. Brain histopathological analysis showed that RS significantly reduced atrophy of neuronal layers in each region of the hippocampus compared with untreated hyperglycemic controls. RS also significantly suppressed TNF-α expression and microglial activation in the brain. These results suggest that RS intake suppresses inflammation in the brain and alleviates the cognitive impairment associated with hyperglycemic diabetes.",Marine drugs,2025,Takaichi Miwa; Masaya Sato; Ning Ma; Keiichi Hiramoto; Masahiro Terasawa; Koji Suzuki
40559632,Marine-Derived Antioxidants: A Comprehensive Review of Their Therapeutic Potential in Oxidative Stress-Associated Diseases.,"Oxidative stress is a critical factor contributing to the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, and neurodegenerative conditions. In recent years, marine-derived antioxidants have emerged as promising therapeutic agents due to their unique biological activities and diverse sources. This comprehensive review explores the therapeutic potential of various marine antioxidants in mitigating oxidative stress-associated diseases. Marine organisms are rich in bioactive compounds, such as polysaccharides, polyphenols, carotenoids, peptides, and vitamins, which exhibit potent antioxidant and free radical scavenging abilities. These compounds have been shown to effectively inhibit oxidative reactions, repair oxidative damage, and enhance the body's antioxidant defense mechanisms. For instance, marine polysaccharides and their derivatives can scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), protect neurons from oxidative damage, and alleviate inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Similarly, marine unsaturated fatty acids, such as omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), have been found to reduce cardiovascular risks by lowering serum triglyceride levels and improving vascular endothelial function. Additionally, marine-derived superoxide dismutase (SOD) plays a crucial role in neutralizing ROS, thereby offering protection against oxidative stress in various diseases. Despite these promising findings, challenges remain in the field, including the need for improved extraction and purification technologies, more comprehensive activity evaluation systems, and further research into the safety and bioavailability of these compounds. This review provides a detailed overview of the current research status, highlighting the types, structural characteristics, antioxidant activities, and mechanisms of action of marine antioxidants. It also identifies key areas for future research and development, aiming to harness the full potential of marine-derived antioxidants in the prevention and treatment of oxidative stress-related diseases.",Marine drugs,2025,Ruiqiu Zhang; Yuke Ren; Tianqi Ren; Yue Yu; Bo Li; Xiaobing Zhou
40559608,Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in Children with Neonatal Parechovirus CNS Infections.,"Human parechoviruses, officially known as Parechovirus A (PeV-A), are more frequently reported as a significant cause of serious infections in newborns and young infants. We aimed to describe the clinical features and neurological outcomes of PeV-A encephalitis cases identified in Warsaw. Infants with suspected encephalitis were retrospectively identified in three hospitals in the summer of 2022. Cases of confirmed PeV-A infection had their comprehensive demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, and outcome data reviewed. The psychomotor development of the children up to the age of 2 years was assessed by using the standardized tools. We identified 18 cases of confirmed encephalitis with a PeV-A infection. Their median age was 16 days. Fourteen cases were included in the analysis, while one patient dropped out after the first visit. Most were boys (9/14), and one patient was born preterm. Three patients had white matter alterations on brain MRI at discharge. No significant neurologic sequelae were observed after acute illness. At the 24-month follow-up, based on the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-IV) and the Brunet-Lézine Scale, the children showed no neurodevelopmental sequelae. Brain MRIs were obtained in all of the participants up to 12 months of age and revealed no significant lesions. Neurodevelopmental complications are not frequent in children after PeV-A encephalitis at 24 months of age. Continued follow-up in larger cohorts is needed to explore the predictors of long-term morbidity.","Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Anna Piwowarczyk; Julia Śladowska; Agata Lipiec; Ernest Kuchar; Elżbieta Stawicka
40559576,The Effects of High-Dose Probiotic Supplementation on Immune Activation and Neurocognitive Disorders in People Living with HIV Undergoing Successful Antiretroviral Treatment: The Procog Study.,"The prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) remains high despite antiretroviral treatment (ART). Changes in gut microbiota and persistent immune activation have been suggested as possible causes, while the role of probiotic supplementation remains controversial. We included subjects with mild HAND and successful ART. They were randomized to receive either 6 months of high-dose probiotic supplementation or to continue with only ART. Immune activation markers and neuropsychological testing were performed at baseline and the end of follow-up. Neuropsychological testing assessed learning, episodic memory, attention/concentration, executive functions, language, information processing speed, and motor skills. Z- and T-scores were calculated for all domains but motor skills, allowing the measurement of the global deficit score (GDS). The trajectories of neuropsychological performances and immune activation markers were compared between groups. From September 2020 to July 2021, 31 PWHs were included (median age 62, 73% men, CD4 744 cc/mm<sup>3</sup>), and 28 completed the 6-month follow-up. The characteristics of the subjects and their neuropsychological performance at baseline in the two groups were similar. At the end of follow-up, probiotics did not have any impact on immune activation markers, while they were associated with better improvement in GDS (T-score 0.0 in controls vs. -0.3 in probiotics, <i>p</i> = 0.048) and the attention/concentration test (Z-score 0.4 in controls vs. 1.2 in probiotics, <i>p</i> = 0.035). Oral supplementation with high-dose probiotics for 6 months did not affect systemic immune activation but was associated with improved neurocognitive performance, suggesting benefits from probiotic supplementation for mild HAND.","Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Matteo Vassallo; Margaux Zerlini; Roxane Fabre; Heloise Joly; Jacques Durant; Alain Makinson; Amandine Mauries; Jacqueline Capeau; Soraya Fellahi; Jean-Philippe Bastard; Christian Pradier; Christine Lebrun-Frenay
40559559,Influenza-Related Encephalopathy in Children: Epidemiology and Literature Review from a Tertiary Hospital in Northern Italy (Winter 2023-2024).,"While influenza-associated encephalopathy (IAE) in children remains a serious concern, recent evidence suggests a shift in its epidemiology, with a possible decline in incidence and severity over time. This retrospective review includes patients aged 0-18 admitted to a tertiary hospital in Northern Italy between November 2023 and February 2025. Inclusion criteria were a positive influenza test, influenza-like symptoms, and neurological involvement. Findings are interpreted alongside current literature. Twenty-five unvaccinated children met criteria for IAE (11 in 2023/24; 14 in 2024/25). Neurological comorbidities were present in 40%. All patients had pathological EEGs. Lumbar puncture was performed in 40%, with abnormalities in 33%. Brain imaging was conducted in 56% of cases, revealing findings in 15%. All received oseltamivir; 60% were also treated with dexamethasone. Severe complications occurred in 16%, while 12% had persistent symptoms or required therapy at discharge. After adjusting for seasonal peak timing, no significant inter-seasonal difference was observed. Although IAE continues to present serious risks, recent trends suggest a changing burden. The lack of vaccination among cases underscores the need for prevention. Study limitations include its single-center design and the absence of long-term follow-up.

40559488,Psychoeducation for Relatives of Young Adults with First-Episode Psychosis: A Qualitative Exploration of Needs and Experiences.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Although psychoeducation for relatives of individuals with a first episode psychosis is important for increasing understanding of psychosis, reducing relapse rates, decreasing hospitalization duration, and improving patient functionality, there is limited research on the specific experiences and needs of relatives of patients with a first episode psychosis. This study aims to explore the experiences and needs of relatives of young adults with first-episode psychosis regarding psychoeducation, with the goal of developing tailored psychoeducation (PE) that can be delivered by nurses. <b>Methods:</b> This qualitative study employed a descriptive, interpretative approach with a total sample of 23 participants, including semi-structured interviews (N = 16), two dyadic interviews (N = 4) and one triadic interview (N = 3). The dyadic interviews included two relatives and two patients, while the triadic interview involved two relatives and one patient. A topic list was utilized to guide the interviews. Thematic analysis was employed to analyse the data, supported by the use of ATLAS.ti. <b>Results:</b> During data analysis, five key themes were identified as relevant for the development of a psychoeducational program: experiences with first-episode psychosis and psychoeducation, the content of PE (what), timing (when), exchanging experiences (how) and joint PE versus separate groups (which format). <b>Conclusions</b>: This study highlights valuable insights and key components for an integrated psychoeducation program, focussing on the needs and experiences of relatives, for the development of the PE program. To optimize the benefits for both parties, future research should explore the potential of offering PE sessions that accommodate both individual and combined participant formats, allowing for a design tailored to the specific needs of the participants.","Nursing reports (Pavia, Italy)",2025,S A Kuipers; C A Elzinga-Hut; B S Rosema; S Sanches; D Boertien; B Stavenuiter; S K Spoelstra; G H M Pijnenborg; N Boonstra
40559461,Exploring the Impact of Emotional Eating in Children: A Narrative Review.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Emotional eating has been recognized as the tendency to eat in response to emotions, being recognized as a crucial risk factor for recurrent weight gain. Emotional eating has been interrelated with obesity/overweight, depression, anxiety, stress, and specific dietary habits at any stage of human life, negatively affecting human quality of life. The present study aims to summarize and explore the effects of emotional eating on children and how these effects may, in turn, influence their mental and physical health at the next stages of their lives. <b>Methods</b>: This is a narrative review of the presently existing clinical evidence concerning the impact of emotional eating in children. A comprehensive search of the most reliable online databases, e.g., PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, was performed utilizing relevant keywords. Several inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to collect only cross-sectional, longitudinal, descriptive, and case-control surveys in children's populations. <b>Results:</b> The current clinical evidence suggests that parental behavior may increase the risk of emotional eating in children. Several pieces of evidence also implied potential associations of emotional eating with overweight/obesity and mental disorders in children. Children's dietary habits may also affect their risk of developing emotional eating. <b>Conclusions</b>: The prevalence of emotional eating is gradually increasing in the general population, and especially in children. Public strategies should be performed to educate parents to recognize potential emotional eating behaviors in their children and to adopt more healthy dietary habits for their children, even in the first months of their life. Educational programs should be organized in school communities to directly educate children on the benefits of healthy dietary patterns.",Pediatric reports,2025,Maria Mentzelou; Sousana K Papadopoulou; Evmorfia Psara; Olga Alexatou; Theodosis Koimtsidis; Constantinos Giaginis

40559458,Targeting the Roots of Psychosis: The Role of Aberrant Salience.,"Aberrant salience, defined as the inappropriate attribution of significance to neutral stimuli, is increasingly recognized as a critical mechanism in the onset of psychotic disorders. In young individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis, abnormal salience processing may serve as a precursor to full-blown psychotic symptoms, contributing to distorted perceptions and the onset of psychotic ideation. This review examines current literature on aberrant salience among UHR youth, exploring its neurobiological, psychological, and behavioral dimensions. Through a comprehensive analysis of studies involving neuroimaging, cognitive assessments, and symptomatology, we assess the consistency of findings across diverse methodologies. Additionally, we evaluate factors contributing to aberrant salience, including neurochemical imbalances, dysregulation in dopamine pathways, and environmental stressors, which may jointly increase psychosis vulnerability. Identifying aberrant salience as a measurable trait in UHR populations could facilitate earlier identification and targeted interventions. Implications for clinical practice are discussed, highlighting the need for specialized therapeutic approaches that address cognitive and emotional dysregulation in salience attribution. Recent research underscores the importance of aberrant salience in early psychosis research and advocates for further studies on intervention strategies to mitigate progression to psychosis among UHR individuals.",Pediatric reports,2025,Giuseppe Marano; Francesco Maria Lisci; Greta Sfratta; Ester Maria Marzo; Francesca Abate; Gianluca Boggio; Gianandrea Traversi; Osvaldo Mazza; Roberto Pola; Eleonora Gaetani; Marianna Mazza
40559454,Expression and Site-Specific Biotinylation of Human Cytosolic 5'-Nucleotidase 1A in <i>Escherichia coli</i>.,"Autoantibodies targeting cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 1A (cN1A) are found in several autoimmune diseases, including inclusion body myositis (IBM), Sjögren's syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus. While they have diagnostic relevance for IBM, little is known about the autoreactive B cells that produce these antibodies. To address this, we developed a robust protocol for the expression and site-specific biotinylation of recombinant human cN1A in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. The resulting antigen is suitable for generating double-labelled fluorescent baits for the isolation and characterisation of cN1A-specific B cells by flow cytometry. Site-specific biotinylation was achieved using the AviTag and BirA ligase, preserving the protein's structure and immunoreactivity. Western blot analysis confirmed that the biotinylated cN1A was recognised by both human and rabbit anti-cN1A antibodies. Compared to conventional chemical biotinylation, this strategy minimises structural alterations that may affect antigen recognition. This approach provides a reliable method for producing biotinylated antigens for use in immunological assays. While demonstrated here for cN1A, the protocol can be adapted for other autoantigens to support studies of antigen-specific B cells in autoimmune diseases.",Methods and protocols,2025,Nataliya Slater; Anuradha Sooda; Frank L Mastaglia; Sue Fletcher; Mark Watson; Merrilee Needham; Jerome D Coudert
40559452,An Efficient Electroporation Protocol Supporting In Vitro Studies of Oligodendrocyte Biology.,"Oligodendrocytes form myelin in the central nervous system, and their dysfunction can cause severe neurological symptoms, as large-scale analyses have highlighted numerous gene expression alterations in pathological conditions. Although in vivo functional gene analyses are preferable, they have several limitations, especially in large-scale studies. Therefore, standardized in vitro systems are needed to facilitate efficient and reliable functional analyses of genes identified in such studies. Here, we describe a practical and efficient method for oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) isolation from mouse brains on postnatal day 6-8 and a gene delivery method for the isolated OPCs. By modifying the magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) procedure with reduced processing volumes, we simplified OPC isolation, allowing simultaneous handling of multiple samples and improving workflow efficiency. We also optimized electroporation parameters to achieve robust transfection efficiency with minimal cell death. Transfected OPCs are suitable for both monoculture-based differentiation assays and co-culture with dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants, in which they reliably differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes and myelinate along the axons. This system enables stable and reproducible in vitro analysis of oligodendrocyte function, supports investigations into both intrinsic differentiation and neuron-glia interactions, and provides a powerful platform for oligodendrocyte research with efficient and timely gene manipulation.",Methods and protocols,2025,Yugo Ishino; Shoko Shimizu; Shingo Miyata
40559326,The C/C Genotype of the C-1019G (rs6295) Polymorphism of the 5-HT1A Receptor Gene Is Associated with Lower Susceptibility to Depressive Symptoms in a Rural Population in Mexico.,"Depression is one of the most prevalent mental health disorders worldwide, affecting a significant proportion of the global population. Its etiology is complex and influenced by the interaction of environmental factors and genetic variations. In Mexico, it has been reported that 41.3% of the population exhibits depressive symptoms. Previous studies have suggested that susceptibility to depression may be associated with the C-1019G (rs6295) polymorphism in the serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptor gene. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association between the C-1019G polymorphism and depressive symptoms in a rural Mexican population. Using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), we examined the effect of C-1019G on depression symptoms, as evaluated by the Beck Depression Inventory. Data were obtained from 83 volunteers; individuals with depressive symptoms and those with a healthy mood were compared. The results showed that the homozygous C/C genotype was found significantly more frequently in the control group than in individuals with depressive symptoms, particularly among men, and is thus associated with a decreased risk of depressive symptomatology. The C/C genotype could protect against susceptibility to developing depressive symptoms in a rural population in Mexico.",Neurology international,2025,Margarita Hernandez-Mixteco; Olga Lidia Valenzuela; Cecilia Luz Balderas-Vazquez; Paola Castillo-Juárez; Sandra Rivera-Gutiérrez; Rocío Liliana García-Reyes; Gilberto Cornejo-Estudillo; Ricardo Jiovanni Soria-Herrera; Moises León-Juárez; Addy Cecilia Helguera-Repetto; Daniel Valencia-Trujillo; Victoria Campos-Peña; Eliud Alfredo Garcia-Montalvo; Jorge Francisco Cerna-Cortés
40559319,Identifying Clinical Measures Related to Falls in Ambulatory Patients with Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy.,"Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult-onset, X-linked, progressive neuromuscular disease caused by abnormal CAG trinucleotide expansion in the androgen receptor gene. Patients with SBMA report difficulty with falls on self-reported activities of daily living scales. To our knowledge, no study has examined the relationship between falls and common clinical measures of strength, balance, mobility, and disease biomarkers. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of an SBMA cohort. The objectives of this study are as follows: (1) compare demographics, clinical measures, and biomarkers between patients who did and did not fall; (2) determine which measures best discriminate fallers from non-fallers; and (3) identify cutoff scores to detect patients with a higher fall risk. Cross-sectional analysis was used. Disease biomarkers included blood serum creatinine, and clinical measures included the Timed Up and Go (TUG), the Adult Myopathy Assessment Tool (AMAT), and posturography, including the Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance and the Motor Control Test. The Maximal Voluntary Isometric Contractions (MVICs) of four lower extremity muscles were captured via fixed-frame dynamometry. We identified three clinical measures that help detect fall risk in people with SBMA. A post hoc receiver operating characteristic curve analysis helped identify cut scores for each test. Impairments of mobility (TUG > 8 s), muscle endurance (AMAT endurance subscale < 14), and muscle strength (ankle plantar flexion MVIC < 45% of predicted) were different between fallers and non-fallers, via independent <i>t</i>-tests. These three clinical tests can help detect fall risk that may help clinicians implement gait aid use or other fall prevention strategies before catastrophic falls occur.",Neurology international,2025,Joseph A Shrader; Allison C Niemic; Rafael Jiménez-Silva; Joshua G Woolstenhulme; Galen O Joe; Uma Jacobs; Ashwini Sansare; Angela Kokkinis; Kenneth Fischbeck; Chris Grunseich; Cris Zampieri
40559318,Evaluation of Sensory and Motor Function in Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy Using Quiet Stance and Reactive Postural Control.,"Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness, along with muscle cramps, tremors, and sensory neuropathy. Previous research has shown that patients with SBMA have difficulty with dynamic balance and sensory postural control during quiet stance. There have been no reports on automatic postural reactions in SBMA. In this study, we aimed (1) to augment previous findings of sensory postural control, (2) to investigate automatic postural reactions in SBMA, and (3) to explore the relationship between strength and balance. A cross-sectional design was used for the analysis. The participants were fifty male individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of SBMA. Balance testing included the NeuroCom modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance (mCTSIB), which measures sway velocity during quiet stance, and the NeuroCom Motor Control Test (MCT), which measures the latency and strength of postural reactions following sudden perturbations. Strength testing included maximal voluntary isometric contractions measured via fixed-frame dynamometry. Forty-seven out of fifty participants were able to complete the mCTSIB test, but only thirty-eight completed the MCT test. Patients who were unable to complete the MCT were significantly weaker in all lower extremity muscles compared to those who were able to complete testing. Compared to normative data, participants showed significantly higher sway velocity during quiet stance across all conditions of the mCTSIB, except when standing on foam with eyes open. They also exhibited significantly slower postural reactions in response to sudden shifts of the force plate on the MCT. Plantarflexor weakness was significantly correlated with poor postural control on the mCTSIB and MCT. This study confirms previously reported abnormalities of sensory postural control in SBMA and highlights patients' heavy reliance on visual inputs for postural control. Additionally, this study shows that automatic postural corrections are slower than normal in SBMA and provides a unique approach for measuring the combined sensory and motor components of the disease. Both the sensory and automatic balance abnormalities were found to be associated with plantarflexor weakness and may contribute to a higher risk of falls under challenging situations. Therefore, addressing this weakness may be an important step toward fall prevention in this population.",Neurology international,2025,Joseph A Shrader; Ashwini Sansare; Allison C Niemic; Rafael Jiménez-Silva; Joshua G Woolstenhulme; Galen O Joe; Uma Jacobs; Angela Kokkinis; Kenneth Fischbeck; Chris Grunseich; Cris Zampieri
40559225,Sonographic Evaluation of Peripheral Nerves and Cervical Nerve Roots in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to nerve atrophy. Ultrasonography has a significant role in the diagnosis of ALS. We aimed to sonographically assess the size of all peripheral nerves and cervical nerve roots in ALS compared to controls. We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase, and Scopus using comprehensive MeSH terms for the keywords nerve, ultrasound, and ALS. We extracted data regarding cross-sectional area (CSA) or diameter for the following nerves: vagus, phrenic, tibial, fibular, sural, radial, ulnar, and median nerves, and the roots of C5, C6, C7, and C8 in both ALS patients and controls. Our study included 2683 participants, of which 1631 were ALS patients (mean age = 60.36), 792 were healthy controls (mean age = 57.79), and 260 were patients with other neurological disorders. ALS patients had significantly smaller nerve size compared to controls. Nerve size differences were observed in the vagus nerve [MD = -0.23], phrenic nerve [MD = -0.25], C5 nerve root [SMD = -0.94], C6 nerve root [SMD = -1.56], C7 nerve root [SMD = -1.18], C8 nerve root [MD = -1.9], accessory nerve [MD = -0.32], sciatic nerve [MD = -11], tibial nerve [MD = -0.68], sural nerve [MD = -0.32,], ulnar nerve [MD = -0.80], and median nerve [MD = -1.21]. Our findings showed that ALS patients have a sonographically smaller nerve size than healthy controls. Therefore, this is a potential marker for neuronal diseases.","Medical sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Anas Elgenidy; Ibrahim A Hassan; Yasser Hamed; Hassan Ahmed Hashem; Osama Abuel-Naga; Hazem I Abdel-Rahman; Kawashty R Mohamed; Belal Mohamed Hamed; Mennatullah A Shehab; Mohamed Zeyada; Somaia Kassab; Shaimaa Sabri Abdelkarim Abdelgawad; Abdelbaki Idriss Ibrahim; Ekram Hassan Hasanin; Amira A Elhoufey; Khalid Hashim Mahmoud; Khaled Saad
40559223,The Potential Effects of Sensor-Based Virtual Reality Telerehabilitation on Lower Limb Function in Patients with Chronic Stroke Facing the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Retrospective Case-Control Study.,"Individuals with chronic stroke often experience various impairments, including poor balance, reduced mobility, limited physical activity, and difficulty performing daily tasks. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, telerehabilitation (TR) can overcome the barriers of geographical and physical distancing, time, costs, and travel, as well as the anxiety about contracting COVID-19. In this retrospective case-control study, we aim to evaluate the motor and cognitive effects of balance TR training carried out with a sensor-based non-immersive virtual reality system compared to conventional rehabilitation in chronic stroke patients. Twenty chronic post-stroke patients underwent evaluation for inclusion in the analysis through an electronic recovery data system. The patients included in the study were divided into two groups with similar medical characteristics and duration of rehabilitation training. However, the groups differed in the type of rehabilitation approach used. The experimental group (EG) received TR with a sensor-based VR device, called VRRS-HomeKit (n. 10). In contrast, the control group (CG) underwent conventional home-based rehabilitation (n. 10). At the end of the training, we observed significant improvements in the EG in the 10-m walking test (10MWT) (<i>p</i> = 0.01), Timed-Up-Go Left (TUG L) (<i>p</i> = 0.01), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (<i>p</i> = 0.005). In our study, we highlighted the potential role of sensor-based virtual reality TR in chronic stroke patients for improving lower limb function, suggesting that this approach is feasible and not inferior to conventional home-based rehabilitation.","Medical sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Mirjam Bonanno; Maria Grazia Maggio; Paolo De Pasquale; Laura Ciatto; Antonino Lombardo Facciale; Morena De Francesco; Giuseppe Andronaco; Rosaria De Luca; Angelo Quartarone; Rocco Salvatore Calabrò
40559221,Impact of Left Atrial Appendage Morphology and Function on Thrombosis Risk in Acute Ischemic Stroke: Insights from Transesophageal Echocardiography.,"<b>Objective:</b> This study aims to investigate the correlation between the morphological and functional characteristics of the left atrial appendage (LAA) and the incidence of thromboembolic events by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in patients with acute ischemic stroke. <b>Methods</b>: This cross-sectional study included 171 patients with acute ischemic stroke, running from November 2022 to September 2024. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed to evaluate the presence of LAA thrombus. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for LAA thrombus. <b>Results:</b> Of the 171 patients, 19 (11.1%) were found to have LAA thrombus. Multivariable logistic regression identified two independent predictors of LAA thrombus formation: (1) left atrial spontaneous echo contrast (OR = 8, 95% CI: 3-19, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and (2) atrial fibrillation (OR = 8, 95% CI: 1.057-76.095, <i>p</i> = 0.044). <b>Conclusions:</b> Left atrial spontaneous echo contrast and atrial fibrillation are independent predictors of LAA thrombus in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The use of transesophageal echocardiography for early detection of LAA thrombus may help improve treatment strategies and prevent recurrent strokes.","Medical sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Dung N Q Nguyen; Dung Thuong Ho; Thanh N H Tran
40559212,"Emerging Therapies for Neurological Disorders: A Clinical Review of MANAGED (Music, Art, Nature-Based, Animal-Assisted, Game, Essential Oil, Dance) Care.","In the face of the limitations in pharmacological and surgical interventions for neurological conditions such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, patients are increasingly turning to non-pharmacological and alternative therapies to manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life. This shift underscores the urgent need for accessible, effective, and affordable treatments. This literature review examines a range of alternative and personalized therapies, including game therapy, animal-assisted therapy, dance therapy, art therapy, music therapy, aroma therapy, and shinrin-yoku therapy. These modalities have demonstrated promising results in mitigating symptoms and enhancing well-being among individuals grappling with neurological disorders. Moreover, these therapies offer a holistic approach that complements traditional medical interventions, underscoring the importance of integrating diverse treatment modalities. Despite their historical roots in non-clinical settings, their potential in modern clinical practice remains untapped. The findings suggest the necessity for further research, particularly large cohort studies, to validate the efficacy of these personalized therapies and advocate for their widespread adoption. In an era marked by escalating healthcare costs, the exploration of alternative therapies presents a compelling avenue for enhancing patient care while simultaneously addressing economic challenges within the healthcare system.",NeuroSci,2025,Alyssa Wan-Chei Lee; Rahim Hirani; Jonathan Ogulnick; Raj K Tiwari; Mill Etienne
40559122,Post-Coma Neurorehabilitation: Neurophysiological Assessment as an Additional Strategic and Essential Competence for the Physiatrist.,"Neurophysiological techniques, particularly somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and electroencephalography (EEG), are essential tools for the functional and prognostic evaluation of patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness (DoC) in intensive neurorehabilitation settings. This narrative review critically analyzes the most relevant evidence regarding the use of SEPs and EEG in the management of post-comatose patients, highlighting the strategic role of physiatrists in integrating these assessments into individualized rehabilitation plans. A systematic search was conducted across major international databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cinahl, and DiTA) until December 2024, selecting consensus documents, official guidelines (including the 2021 ERC/ESICM guidelines), systematic reviews, observational studies, and significant Italian neurophysiological contributions. The literature supports the strong prognostic value of the bilateral presence of the N20 component in SEPs, while its early bilateral absence, particularly in post-anoxic cases, is a robust predictor of poor neurological outcomes. EEG provides complementary information, with continuous, reactive, and symmetrical patterns associated with favorable outcomes, while pathological patterns, such as burst suppression or isoelectric activity, predict a worse prognosis. Combining SEP and EEG assessments significantly improves prognostic sensitivity and specificity, especially in sedated or metabolically compromised patients. Additionally, the use of direct muscle stimulation (DMS) and nerve conduction studies enables accurate differentiation between central and peripheral impairments, which is crucial for effective rehabilitation planning. Overall, SEPs and EEG should be systematically incorporated into the evaluation and follow-up of DoC patients, and the acquisition of neurophysiological competencies by physiatrists represents a strategic priority for modern, effective, and personalized neurorehabilitation.",Journal of personalized medicine,2025,Luigi Di Lorenzo; Carmine D'Avanzo
40558673,Cannabinoid Receptor 1 Regulates Zebrafish Renal Multiciliated Cell Development via cAMP Signaling.,"Endocannabinoid signaling plays a significant role in neurogenesis and nervous system physiology, but its roles in the development of other tissues are just beginning to be appreciated. Previous reports have shown the presence of the key endocannabinoid receptor Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1 or Cnr1) in multiciliated (MCC) tissues and its upregulation in kidney diseases, yet the relationship between Cnr1 and renal MCC development is unknown. Here, we report that Cnr1 is essential for cilia development across tissues and regulates renal MCCs via cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling during zebrafish embryogenesis. Using a combination of genetic and pharmacological studies, we found that the loss of function, agonism and antagonism of <i>cnr1</i> all lead to reduced mature renal MCC populations. <i>cnr1</i> deficiency also led to reduced cilia development across tissues, including the pronephros, ear, Kupffer's vesicle (KV), and nasal placode. Interestingly, treatment with the cAMP activator Forskolin (FSK) restored renal MCC defects in agonist-treated embryos, suggesting that <i>cnr1</i> mediates cAMP signaling in renal MCC development. Meanwhile, treatment with the cAMP inhibitor SQ-22536 alone or with <i>cnr1</i> deficiency led to reduced MCC populations, suggesting that <i>cnr1</i> also mediates renal MCC development independently of cAMP signaling. Our findings indicate that <i>cnr1</i> has a critical role in controlling renal MCC development both via cAMP signaling and an independent pathway, further revealing implications for ciliopathies and renal diseases.",Journal of developmental biology,2025,Thanh Khoa Nguyen; Sophia Baker; Julienne Angtuaco; Liana Arceri; Samuel Kaczor; Bram Fitzsimonds; Matthew R Hawkins; Rebecca A Wingert
40558649,Systematic Review on HRV Reference Values.,"Heart rate variability (HRV) has been established as a measure for the variation in time intervals between successive cardiac actions as a marker of the autonomic nervous system. However, despite many efforts in this field, there are no reference values that are generally accepted. The objective of this systematic review is, therefore, to present an overview of the studies on HRV normal values published to date, with due consideration of any influencing factors. A systematic database query was carried out in PubMed, Scopus, Ovid Medline, and PsychInfo using the search string ""((hrv) or (heart rate variability)) and ((reference values) or (reference range) or (normal values))"". Of the 6640 studies yielded by the query, 58 were used for this systematic review. The STARD-HRV procedure was used to assess the quality of the studies. The studies considered date from 1989 to 2022. The number of subjects examined was between 20 and 84,772. The age of the subjects was between 1 day and 99 years. A total of 51 of the studies examined both male and female subjects. In total, 19 studies used long-term measurements, 22 studies used short-term measurements, and 17 studies used intermediate measuring periods. Many different HRV parameters were analyzed, most often traditional time-domain and frequency-domain ones. Nine studies described the subjects as ""healthy"" without giving more detailed explanations. There are no generally accepted HRV normal values (yet). Some large studies provide values that may be used for orientation purposes. However, further studies are required to collect HRV normal values. It was not possible to merge the results of the studies in terms of a meta-analysis; this would also not be practical since, among other reasons, the consideration of confounders as well as recording and measuring modalities sometimes vary to a large extent and impede the comparability of the studies. Generally, HRV seems to be influenced by various mechanisms and external factors that are still not fully understood. An exploration of these factors will ultimately allow HRV normal values to be obtained in a manner that is generally accepted.",Journal of cardiovascular development and disease,2025,Maximillian Brozat; Irina Böckelmann; Stefan Sammito
40558566,Muscle Spatial Transcriptomic Reveals Heterogeneous Profiles in Juvenile Dermatomyositis and Persistence of Abnormal Signature After Remission.,"This study aimed to investigate the spatial heterogeneity of molecular signature in the muscle of juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) patients before and after treatment. Unsupervised reference-free deconvolution of spatial transcriptomics and standardized morphometry were performed in two JDM muscle biopsies with different clinical severity at disease onset and compared to healthy muscle. Identified signatures were scored in two additional JDM muscle biopsies from the same patient before and after remission. Disappearance of the normal muscle signature mostly corresponding to mitochondrial biology was observed in JDM. Three pathological transcriptomic signatures were isolated, related to ""myofibrillar stress"", ""muscle remodeling"" and ""interferon signaling"" signatures. The ""myofibrillar stress signature"" was prominent in the most severe biopsy while the ""muscle remodeling"" signature was mostly present in the biopsy from the patient with good outcome. These signatures unveiled genes not previously associated with JDM including ANKRD1 and FSLT1 for ""myofibrillar stress"" and ""muscle remodeling"" signatures, respectively. Post-treatment analysis of muscle after two years remission showed a persistence of pathological signatures. This pilot study of JDM muscle identified spatially distributed pathological signatures that persist after remission. This work paves the way for a better understanding of the pathophysiology in affected muscle and the identification of biomarkers that predict relapse.",Cells,2025,Margot Tragin; Séverine A Degrelle; Baptiste Periou; Brigitte Bader-Meunier; Christine Barnerias; Christine Bodemer; Isabelle Desguerre; Mathieu Paul Rodero; François Jérôme Authier; Cyril Gitiaux
40558565,Cannabidiol Effects on Depressive-like Behavior and Neuroinflammation in Female Rats Exposed to High-Fat Diet and Unpredictable Chronic Mild Stress.,"Depression and obesity are comorbid conditions linked through shared neuroinflammatory and immune mechanisms. This study examined the effects of chronic cannabidiol (CBD) treatment on behavior and neuroinflammatory gene expression in female rats exposed to a combined model of high-fat diet (HFD) and unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS). Rats were subjected to an acute HFD for 2 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of UCMS. CBD (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle was administered during the final 2 weeks of UCMS. Specifically, mRNA levels of nuclear factor kappa B1 (NF-κB1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and IL-6 were measured in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and CA1. CBD's effects varied depending on the type of stressor. It promoted coping behavior, increased locomotion, reduced freezing, and restored UCMS-induced depressive-like behavior in a splash test. In the vmPFC, CBD normalized the HFD- and UCMS-induced increase in il1β, and downregulated nfkb1 and tnfa expression. In the CA1, it normalized stress-induced downregulation in nfkb1 expression. These findings suggest that the efficacy of CBD in modulating both behavior and neuroinflammation is contingent upon the nature of the stress exposure, highlighting its potential as a targeted treatment for stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders in females.",Cells,2025,Tal Sabbag; Milly Kritman; Irit Akirav
40558561,"Investigating the Synergistic Neuroprotective Effects of Plant-Derived Antioxidants and the Psychedelic N,N-Dimethyltryptamine in Alzheimer's Disease Therapy.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic and complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline, memory loss, and irreversible impairment of brain functions. The etiology of AD is multifactorial, involving a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and physiological factors, including the aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and oxidative stress (OS). The role of OS in AD pathogenesis is of particular significance, given that an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants promotes cellular damage, exacerbates Aβ deposition, and leads to cognitive deterioration. Despite extensive research, current therapeutic strategies have largely failed, likely due to the use of single-target drugs unable to halt the multifactorial progression of the disease. In this study, we investigated the synergistic therapeutic effect of plant-derived bioactive compounds Withanone, Apigenin, Bacoside A, Baicalin, and Thymoquinone in combination with N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (NN-DMT), a psychedelic molecule. We used a transgenic <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> model to assess the behavioral and molecular outcomes following compound exposure. Motility assays, thioflavin S staining, and survival assays under oxidative stress were employed to evaluate the treatment efficacy. The results of the behavioral and molecular analyses indicated that the combination therapy exhibited a higher efficacy than the monotherapies, leading to a significant reduction in age-related motility defects in the AD model. Furthermore, the combination treatment substantially reduced Aβ plaque burden, enhanced survival following OS insult, and demonstrated a synergistic effect in mitigating AD-related hallmarks. Taken together, these findings support the potential of combining NN-DMT with specific bioactive compounds as a promising multi-target therapeutic approach for AD.",Cells,2025,Júlia Jarne-Ferrer; Mercè Pallàs; Christian Griñán-Ferré; Aina Bellver-Sanchis
40558549,Concurrent Physical Activity Protects Against C26 Adenocarcinoma Tumor-Mediated Cardiac and Skeletal Muscle Dysfunction and Wasting in Males.,"Muscle loss unresponsive to nutritional supplementation affects up to 80% of cancer patients and severely reduces survival and treatment response. Exercise may help preserve muscle mass and function, yet the translatability of preclinical methods remains questionable. This study aimed to assess how voluntary wheel running, a clinically relevant physical activity, protects skeletal and cardiac muscle against cancer-mediated dysfunction and identify underlying molecular mechanisms. BALB/c mice were assigned to sedentary nontumor-bearing (SED+NT), sedentary tumor-bearing (SED+T), wheel run nontumor-bearing (WR+NT), and wheel run tumor-bearing (WR+T). Tumor-bearing groups received 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> C26 cells; WR mice had wheel access for 4 weeks. Muscle function and tissue were analyzed for protective mechanisms. SED+T mice exhibited significant fat and lean mass loss, indicating cachexia, which was prevented in WR+T mice. SED+T also showed 15% reduced grip strength and cardiac dysfunction, while WR+T preserved function. WR+T mice had lower expression of muscle wasting markers (Atrogin1, MuRF1, GDF15, GDF8/11). Physical activity also reduced tumor mass by 57% and volume by 37%. Voluntary wheel running confers tumor-suppressive, myoprotective, and cardioprotective effects. These findings support physical activity as a non-pharmacological strategy to combat cancer-related muscle wasting and dysfunction.",Cells,2025,Louisa Tichy; Kimberly F Allred; Erika T Rezeli; Michael F Coleman; Clinton D Allred; Stephen D Hursting; Traci L Parry
40558545,Cellular and Molecular Interactions in CNS Injury: The Role of Immune Cells and Inflammatory Responses in Damage and Repair.,"The central nervous system (CNS) is highly susceptible to damage due to its limited ability to regenerate. Injuries to the CNS, whether from trauma, ischemia, or neurodegenerative diseases, disrupt both cellular and vascular structures, leading to immediate (primary) and subsequent (secondary) damage. Primary damage involves the physical disruption of cells and blood vessels, weakening the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and triggering excitotoxicity and calcium overload. Secondary damage develops over hours to days and is marked by ionic imbalance, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation, which further aggravates tissue damage. Inflammation plays a dual role: acute inflammation helps in repair, while chronic inflammation accelerates neurodegeneration. Microglia and astrocytes play key roles in this inflammatory response, with M1-like microglia promoting pro-inflammatory responses and M2-like microglia supporting anti-inflammatory and repair processes. Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins such as Tau, amyloid-beta, TDP-43, and α-synuclein, which impair cellular function and lead to neuronal loss. Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins and influenced by genetic risk factors (e.g., <i>APOE4, TARDBP</i>). Despite the CNS's limited regenerative abilities, processes like synaptogenesis, neurogenesis, axonal regeneration, and remyelination offer potential for recovery. Therapeutic approaches aim to target inflammatory pathways, enhance repair mechanisms, and develop neuroprotective treatments to counter excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Advances in stem cell therapy, gene therapy, and personalized medicine hold promise for improving outcomes. Future research should focus on combining strategies, utilizing advanced technologies, and conducting translational studies to bridge the gap between preclinical research and clinical application. By better understanding and leveraging the complex processes of CNS injury and repair, researchers hope to develop effective therapies to restore function and enhance the quality of life for individuals with CNS disorders.",Cells,2025,Jai Chand Patel; Meenakshi Shukla; Manish Shukla
40558542,Exome Study of Single Nucleotide Variations in Patients with Syndromic and Non-Syndromic Autism Reveals Potential Candidate Genes for Diagnostics and Novel Single Nucleotide Variants.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental impairment that occurs due to mutations related to the formation of the nervous system, combined with the impact of various epigenetic and environmental factors. This necessitates the identification of the genetic variations involved in ASD pathogenesis. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) in a cohort of 22 Bulgarian male and female individuals showing ASD features alongside segregation analyses of their families. A targeted panel of genes was chosen and analyzed for each case, based on a detailed examination of clinical data. Gene analyses revealed that specific variants concern key neurobiological processes involving neuronal architecture, development, and function. These variants occur in a number of genes, including <i>SHANK3</i>, <i>DLG3</i>, <i>NALCN</i>, and <i>PACS2</i> which are critical for synaptic signaling imbalance, <i>CEP120</i> and <i>BBS5</i> for ciliopathies, <i>SPTAN1</i> for spectrins structure, <i>SPATA5</i>, <i>TRAK1</i>, and <i>VPS13B</i> for neuronal organelles trafficking and integrity, <i>TAF6</i>, <i>SMARCB1</i>, <i>DDX3X</i>, <i>MECP2</i>, and <i>SETD1A</i> for gene expression, <i>CDK13</i> for cell cycle control, <i>ALDH5A1, DPYD</i>, <i>FH</i>, and <i>PDHX</i> for mitochondrial function, and <i>PQBP1</i>, <i>HUWE1</i>, and WDR45 for neuron homeostasis. Novel single nucleotide variants in the <i>SPATA5</i>, <i>CEP120</i>, <i>BBS5, SETD1A</i>, <i>TRAK1</i>, <i>VPS13B</i>, and <i>DDX3X</i> genes have been identified and proposed for use in ASD diagnostics.

40558538,Autophagy and Alzheimer's Disease: Mechanisms and Impact Beyond the Brain.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by neuronal loss, cognitive decline, and pathological hallmarks such as amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles. Recent evidence highlights autophagy as a pivotal mechanism in cellular homeostasis, mediating the clearance of misfolded proteins and damaged organelles. However, impaired autophagy contributes significantly to AD pathogenesis by disrupting proteostasis, exacerbating neuroinflammation, and promoting synaptic dysfunction. This review aims to scrutinize the intricate relationship between autophagy dysfunction and AD progression, explaining key pathways including macroautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), and selective autophagy processes such as mitophagy and aggrephagy. This further extends the discussion beyond the central nervous system, evaluating the role of hepatic autophagy in Aβ clearance and systemic metabolic regulation. An understanding of autophagy's involvement in AD pathology via various mechanisms could give rise to a novel therapeutic strategy targeting autophagic modulation to mitigate disease progression in the future.",Cells,2025,Zaw Myo Hein; Thirupathirao Vishnumukkala; Barani Karikalan; Aisyah Alkatiri; Farida Hussan; Saravanan Jagadeesan; Mohd Amir Kamaruzzaman; Muhammad Danial Che Ramli; Che Mohd Nasril Che Mohd Nassir; Prarthana Kalerammana Gopalakrishna
40558537,A Comprehensive Review of the Pathophysiology of Neonatal Stroke and a Critique of Current and Future Therapeutic Strategies.,"Within the first 28 days after birth, more than 1 in every 2500 newborns will suffer a stroke. The weekly-adjusted risk of stroke for a term-born infant is threefold higher than for a male smoker aged 50 to 59 years with hypertension and diabetes. Neonatal stroke has significant clinical and socio-economic consequences, leading to cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and a range of motor, sensory, and cognitive impairments. Currently, there is no treatment for the brain damage caused by neonatal stroke. In this review, we outline the differences in the complex interplay of inflammation, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and cell death after stroke between adults and neonates, which limits the direct transfer of knowledge between studies for understanding injury. We comprehensively document what is known about the pathophysiology of neonatal stroke and critically evaluate current therapeutic strategies, emphasising the urgent need for innovative treatments tailored to suit the neonatal brain. This analysis reveals that treatment with an injectable hydrogel scaffold, a three-dimensional, water-swollen polymer network, may be an innovative, viable approach to improve outcomes for infants suffering from the most severe forms of brain injury arising from neonatal stroke.",Cells,2025,Victor Mondal; Emily Ross-Munro; Gayathri K Balasuriya; Ritu Kumari; Md Munnaf Hossen; Mohammed Ageeli; Kate Firipis; David R Nisbet; Glenn F King; Richard J Williams; Pierre Gressens; Jeanie L Y Cheong; Flora Y Wong; David W Walker; Mary Tolcos; Bobbi Fleiss
40558535,The Evolving Landscape of Functional Models of Autism Spectrum Disorder.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting 1-3% of the population globally. Owing to its multifactorial origin, complex genetics, and heterogeneity in clinical phenotypes, it is difficult to faithfully model ASD. In essence, ASD is an umbrella term for a group of individually rare disorders, each risk gene accounting for <1% of cases, threaded by a set of overlapping behavioral or molecular phenotypes. Validated behavioral tests are considered a gold standard for ASD diagnosis, and several animal models (rodents, pigs, and non-human primates) have traditionally been used to study its molecular basis. These models recapitulate the human phenotype to a varying degree and have been indispensable to preclinical research, but they cannot be used to study human-specific features such as protracted neuronal maturation and cell-intrinsic attributes, posing serious limitations to translatability. Human stem cell-based models, both as monolayer 2D cultures and 3D organoids and assembloids, can circumvent these limitations. Generated from a patient's own reprogrammed cells, these can be used for testing therapeutic interventions that are more condition and patient relevant, targeting developmental windows where the intervention would be most effective. We discuss some of these advancements by comparing traditional and recent models of ASD.",Cells,2025,Jai Ranjan; Aniket Bhattacharya
40558534,Development of Positron Emission Tomography Radiotracers for Imaging α-Synuclein Aggregates.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) that are characterized by the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates in both neurons and the non-neuronal cells of the brain are called synucleinopathies. The most common synucleinopathies includes Parkinson's disease (PD), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Significant progress has been made in the development of positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers for synucleinopathies, yielding several α-syn tracers that have entered clinical studies. However, selective α-syn imaging still faces inherent challenges. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the progress in α-syn PET radiotracers from three angles: Alzheimer's disease (AD)-derived scaffolds, representative compound scaffolds and analogs, and the identification of α-syn tracers through high-throughput screening (HTS). We discuss the characteristics, advantages, and limitations of the tracers for preclinical and clinical application. Finally, future directions in the development of radioligands for proteinopathies are discussed. There is no clinical available PET radiotracer for imaging α-syn aggregates, but these advances have laid a key foundation for non-invasive α-syn imaging and early diagnosis of synucleinopathies.",Cells,2025,Xiaodi Guo; Jie Xiang; Keqiang Ye; Zhentao Zhang
40558519,Multi-Modal Analysis of Satellite Cells Reveals Early Impairments at Pre-Contractile Stages of Myogenesis in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.,"Recent studies on myogenic satellite cells (SCs) in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) documented altered division capacities and impaired regeneration potential of SCs in DMD patients and animal models. It remains unknown, however, if SC-intrinsic effects trigger these deficiencies at pre-contractile stages of myogenesis rather than resulting from the pathologic environment. In this study, we isolated SCs from a porcine DMD model and age-matched wild-type (WT) piglets for comprehensive analysis. Using immunofluorescence, differentiation assays, traction force microscopy (TFM), RNA-seq, and label-free proteomic measurements, SCs behavior was characterized, and molecular changes were investigated. TFM revealed significantly higher average traction forces in DMD than WT SCs (90.4 ± 10.5 Pa vs. 66.9 ± 8.9 Pa; <i>p</i> = 0.0018). We identified 1390 differentially expressed genes and 1261 proteins with altered abundance in DMD vs. WT SCs. Dysregulated pathways uncovered by gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis included sarcomere organization, focal adhesion, and response to hypoxia. Multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA) integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data, identified five factors accounting for the observed variance with an overall higher contribution of the transcriptomic data. Our findings suggest that SC impairments result from their inherent genetic abnormality rather than from environmental influences.

40558513,"Ultrasound-Mediated Drug Diffusion, Uptake, and Cytotoxicity in a Glioblastoma 3D Tumour Sphere Model.","A myriad of biological effects can be stimulated by ultrasound (US) for the treatment of cancer. The objective of our research was to investigate the effect of ultrasound alone and in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin (DOX) and temozolomide (TMZ) on human glioblastoma (GBM) and the human epidermoid carcinoma cancer 2D and 3D cell cultures. The results indicated that the US 96-probe device could induce tumour sphere cytotoxicity in a dosage- and time-dependent manner, with multiple treatments augmenting this cytotoxic effect. With enhanced cytotoxicity, US decreased tumour sphere growth metabolic activity, disrupted spheroid integrity, and heightened the occurrence of DNA double strand breaks, resulting in damage to tumour spheres and an inability to rebuild tumour spheres after multiple US treatments. The combination of US and TMZ/DOX enhanced the efficiency of treatment for GBM and epidermoid carcinoma by enhancing induced cytotoxicity in 3D tumour spheres compared to 2D monolayer cells and also by increasing the incubation time, which is the most crucial way to differentiate between the effectiveness of drug treatment with and without US. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that US enhances drug diffusion, uptake, and cytotoxicity using 3D spheroid models when compared with 2D cultures. They also demonstrate the significance of 3D cell culture models in drug delivery and discovery research.",Cells,2025,Janith Wanigasekara; Julie Rose Mae Mondala; Patrick J Cullen; Brijesh K Tiwari; Gemma K Kinsella; James F Curtin
40558500,Modulating Cognition-Linked Histone Acetyltransferases (HATs) as a Therapeutic Strategy for Neurodegenerative Diseases: Recent Advances and Future Trends.,"Recent investigations into the neuroepigenome of the brain are providing unparalleled understanding into the impact of post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histones in regulating dynamic gene expression patterns required for adult brain cognitive function and plasticity. Histone acetylation is one of the most well-characterized PTMs shown to be required for neuronal function and cognition. Histone acetylation initiates neural circuitry plasticity via chromatin control, enabling neurons to respond to external environmental stimuli and adapt their transcriptional responses accordingly. While interplay between histone acetylation and deacetylation is critical for these functions, dysregulation during the aging process can lead to significant alterations in the neuroepigenetic landscape. These alterations contribute to impaired cognitive functions, neuronal cell death, and brain atrophy, all hallmarks of age-related neurodegenerative disease. Significantly, while age-related generation of DNA mutations remains irreversible, most neuroepigenetic PTMs are reversible. Thus, manipulation of the neural epigenome is proving to be an effective therapeutic strategy for neuroprotection in multiple types of age-related neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) that include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington's disease (HD). Here, we highlight recent progress in research focusing on specific HAT-based neuroepigenetic mechanisms that underlie cognition and pathogenesis that is hallmarked in age-related NDs. We further discuss how these findings have potential to be translated into HAT-mediated cognitive-enhancing therapeutics to treat these debilitating disorders.",Cells,2025,Huong Anh Mai; Christina M Thomas; Gu Gu Nge; Felice Elefant
40558498,Gut Microbiota in a Viral Model of Multiple Sclerosis: Modulation and Pitfalls by Oral Antibiotic Treatment.,"Viral infections have been associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), an immune-mediated disease in the central nervous system (CNS). Since Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) can induce MS-like demyelination, TMEV infection is the most widely used viral model for MS. Although the precise pathophysiology is unknown, altered fecal bacterial populations were associated with distinct immune gene expressions in the CNS. We aimed to determine the role of gut microbiota in TMEV infection by administering an antibiotic cocktail in drinking water before (prophylactic administration) or after (therapeutic administration) TMEV infection. The antibiotic administration reduced total eubacteria, including the phyla <i>Bacillota</i> and <i>Bacteroidota</i>, but increased the phylum <i>Pseudomonadata</i> in feces. Prophylactic administration did not alter TMEV-induced inflammatory demyelination clinically or histologically, without changes in anti-viral IgG1/IgG2c levels or lymphoproliferative responses; therapeutic administration temporarily suppressed the neurological signs. Although antibiotic treatment had minimal effects on TMEV infection, adding metronidazole and ampicillin in drinking water substantially reduced water intake in the antibiotic group of mice, resulting in significant body weight loss. Since dehydration and stress could affect immune responses and gut microbiota, caution should be exercised when planning or evaluating the oral antibiotic cocktail treatment in experimental animals.",Cells,2025,Ijaz Ahmad; Seiichi Omura; Sundar Khadka; Fumitaka Sato; Ah-Mee Park; Sandesh Rimal; Ikuo Tsunoda
40558496,Development and In Vitro Characterization of [<sup>3</sup>H]GMC-058 as Radioligand for Imaging Parkinsonian-Related Proteinopathies.,"The molecular imaging of α-synuclein (α-syn) pathology in Parkinson's disease (PD) and related movement disorders is a clinically unmet need. The aim of this study was to discover and characterize in vitro a radioligand for imaging α-syn pathology. A library of 78 small molecules was developed and screened using recombinant α-syn fibrils and brain homogenates from Alzheimer's disease (AD) donors. The selection criteria were as follows: <i>K</i>i<sub>α-syn</sub> < 30 nM, <i>K</i>i<sub>tau</sub> and <i>K</i>i<sub>A-β</sub> > 200 nM. Three compounds, GMC-073 (<i>K</i><sub>iα-syn</sub>: 8 nM), GMC-098 (<i>K</i>i<sub>α-syn</sub>: 9.7 nM), and GMC-058 (<i>K</i>i<sub>α-syn</sub>: 22.5 nM), fulfilled the criteria and were radiolabeled with <sup>3</sup>H. [<sup>3</sup>H]GMC-058 was the only compound with negligible binding in controls, and was further evaluated using tissue microarrays, autoradiography on fresh-frozen brain slices, and in vitro saturation binding assay on brain homogenates. [<sup>3</sup>H]GMC-058 binding co-localized with α-syn inclusions in Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple-system atrophy (MSA), with dense A-β plaques in cerebral amyloid angiopathy and AD and with p-tau inclusions in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Specific binding was highest in PSP and CBD. In vitro <i>K</i><sub>D</sub> was highest in AD (5.4 nM), followed by PSP (41 nM) and CBD (75 nM). The <i>K</i><sub>D</sub> in MSA, PD, and controls was >100 nM. [<sup>3</sup>H]GMC-058 is a novel radioligand displaying a low affinity for aggregated α-syn in tissue, with an in vitro profile also suitable for detecting tau pathology in 4R tauopathies.",Cells,2025,Andrea Varrone; Vasco C Sousa; Manolo Mugnaini; Sandra Biesinger; Gunnar Nordvall; Lee Kingston; Ileana Guzzetti; Charles S Elmore; Dan Sunnemark; Dinahlee Saturnino Guarino; Sjoerd J Finnema; Magnus Schou
40558493,5' DREDGE: Direct Repeat-Enabled Downregulation of Gene Expression via the 5' UTR of Target Genes.,"Despite the availability of numerous methods for controlling gene expression, there remains a strong need for technologies that maximize two key properties: selectivity and reversibility. To this end, we developed a novel approach that exploits the highly sequence-specific nature of CRISPR-associated endoribonucleases (Cas RNases), which recognize and cleave short RNA sequences known as direct repeats (DRs). In this approach, referred to as DREDGE (direct repeat-enabled downregulation of gene expression), selective control of gene expression is enabled by introducing one or more DRs into the untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs, which can then be cleaved upon expression of the cognate Cas RNase. We previously demonstrated that the expression of target genes with DRs in their 3' UTRs are efficiently controlled by the DNase-dead version of Cas12a (dCas12a) with a high degree of selectivity and complete reversibility. Here, we assess the feasibility of using DREDGE to regulate the expression of genes with DRs inserted in their 5' UTRs. Among the five different Cas RNases tested, Csy4 was found to be the most efficient in this context, yielding robust downregulation with rapid onset in doxycycline-regulatable systems targeting either a stably expressed fluorescent protein or an endogenous gene, both in a fully reversible manner. Unexpectedly, dCas12a was also found to be modestly effective despite binding essentially irreversibly to the cut mRNA on its 5' end and thereby boosting mRNA levels. Our results expand the utility of DREDGE as an attractive method for regulating gene expression in a targeted, highly selective, and fully reversible manner.",Cells,2025,Sagar J Parikh; Heather M Terron; Luke A Burgard; Dylan D Butler; Frank M LaFerla; Shelley Lane; Malcolm A Leissring
40558456,Assessing the Role of EEG Biosignal Preprocessing to Enhance Multiscale Fuzzy Entropy in Alzheimer's Disease Detection.,"Quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) has emerged as a promising tool for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among QEEG measures, Multiscale Fuzzy Entropy (MFE) shows great potential in identifying AD-related changes in EEG complexity. However, MFE is intrinsically linked to signal amplitude, which can vary substantially among EEG systems, and this hinders the adoption of this metric for AD detection. To overcome this issue, this study investigates different preprocessing strategies to make the calculation of MFE less dependent on the specific amplitude characteristics of the EEG signals at hand. This contributes to generalizing and making more robust the adoption of MFE for AD detection. To demonstrate the robustness of the proposed preprocessing methods, binary classification tasks with Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifiers are used. Performance metrics, such as classification accuracy and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), are employed to assess the results. The methodology is validated on two public EEG datasets. Results show that amplitude transformation, particularly normalization, significantly enhances AD detection, achieving mean classification accuracy values exceeding 80% with an uncertainty of 10% across all classifiers. These results highlight the importance of preprocessing in improving the accuracy and the reliability of EEG-based AD diagnostic tools, offering potential advancements in patient management and treatment planning.",Biosensors,2025,Pasquale Arpaia; Maria Cacciapuoti; Andrea Cataldo; Sabatina Criscuolo; Egidio De Benedetto; Antonio Masciullo; Marisa Pesola; Raissa Schiavoni
40558453,Sudomotor Dysfunction as an Early Marker of Autonomic and Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes: Insights from a Cross-Sectional Study Using SUDOSCAN.,"Diabetic neuropathy, particularly in its autonomic form, is often underdiagnosed despite its clinical significance. Electrochemical skin conductance (ESC), measured by SUDOSCAN, offers a non-invasive way to assess the autonomic dysfunction. A total of 288 diabetic patients were assessed using SUDOSCAN to measure ESC in the hands and feet. Clinical and laboratory parameters, including glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, lipid profile, and cardiovascular risk, were analyzed for correlations with ESC. Neuropathy status was evaluated, and ROC analysis was performed to assess diagnostic accuracy. Sudomotor dysfunction was prevalent, particularly in patients with a diabetes duration exceeding 20 years (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Men showed significantly higher right foot ESC than women (76.5 ± 13.1 vs. 74.0 ± 13.5 µS, <i>p</i> = 0.041). A strong inverse correlation was found between cardiovascular risk score and right foot ESC (r = -0.455, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Left foot ESC also correlated inversely with cardiovascular risk (r = -0.401, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and HbA1c (r = -0.150, <i>p</i> = 0.049), while a weak positive correlation was seen with BMI (r = 0.145, <i>p</i> = 0.043). ROC analysis showed the highest area under the curve (AUC) in right foot ESC for autonomic neuropathy (AUC = 0.750, 95% CI: 0.623-0.877, <i>p</i> < 0.001). This study is among the few to systematically correlate ESC with validated cardiovascular risk scores in a diabetic outpatient cohort, highlighting its potential as a novel early screening biomarker for autonomic and cardiovascular complications.",Biosensors,2025,Larisa Anghel; Claudiu Cobuz; Laura-Cătălina Benchea; Vasile Maciuc; Maricela Cobuz; Radu-Andy Sascău; Cristian Stătescu
40558449,Influence of Gait Speed on Inter-Joint Coordination in People with and Without Parkinson's Disease.,"The influence of gait speed on lower-extremity coordination while walking in people with Parkinson's disease (pwPD) is poorly understood. This study sought to investigate the relationship between gait speed and hip-knee coordination and coordination variability in older adults and pwPD. A total of 27 pwPD and 21 healthy older adults were recruited. Participants walked in a straight line at slow, preferred, and fast walking speeds. Gait data were collected using inertial measurement units, and the kinematics of the hip and knee were calculated. Coordination and coordination variability at the hip-knee joint pair were determined using continuous relative phase. A repeated measures two-way ANCOVA tested the impact of gait speed on coordination and coordination variability, while group differences were evaluated using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Neither the healthy older adults nor the pwPD adjusted their hip-knee coordination in response to changes in gait speed. pwPD also displayed a trend towards restricted hip and knee joint excursion compared to older adults, which may further limit their ability to adapt gait strategies. These findings suggest that interventions addressing both joint excursion and motor adaptability may be important for improving gait function in individuals with Parkinson's disease. Real-world applicability can be found in the potential of wearable sensors to become a valuable tool in routine clinical practice for both diagnosis and ongoing management. The study is registered in the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00022998).",Biosensors,2025,Patrick Ippersiel; Philippe C Dixon; Elke Warmerdam; Robbin Romijnders; Walter Maetzler; Clint Hansen
40558447,Wearable Ultrasound-Imaging-Based Visual Feedback (UVF) Training for Ankle Rehabilitation of Chronic Stroke Survivors: A Proof-of-Concept Randomized Crossover Study.,"This study investigated the effect of wearable ultrasound-imaging-based visual feedback (UVF) on assisting paretic ankle dorsiflexion training of chronic stroke survivors. Thirty-three participants with unilateral hemiplegia performed maximal isometric contractions on an isokinetic dynamometer in randomized conditions with and without UVF that provided by a wearable ultrasound imaging system. Torque parameters (mean, peak, percentage of maximal voluntary contraction) and tibialis anterior muscle thickness were analyzed across different contraction phases. Statistical comparisons were conducted using paired <i>t</i>-tests or Wilcoxon tests. Correlation analyses were performed using Pearson's or Spearman's tests. Results demonstrated that UVF significantly improved torque output, as evidence by the increased percentage of maximal voluntary contraction (%MVC) during entire contractions (<i>p</i> = 0.007), increased mean (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.022) and peak (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.044) torque and the %MVC (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.004) during mid and end phases, and larger muscle thickness during mid contraction (<i>p</i> = 0.045). Moderate correlations were found between torque and muscle thickness (r ≥ 0.30, <i>p</i> ≤ 0.049). These findings preliminarily supported the positive outcomes of real-time wearable UVFs in enhancing paretic ankle dorsiflexion strength and force control during isometric contractions in chronic stroke survivors. While the developed and validated new training protocol may potentially serve as a practical adjunct to existing rehabilitation approaches, further investigations emphasizing the functional outcomes and clinical translations are still needed to verify the clinical utility.",Biosensors,2025,Yu-Yan Luo; Chen Huang; Zhen Song; Vaheh Nazari; Arnold Yu-Lok Wong; Lin Yang; Mingjie Dong; Mingming Zhang; Yong-Ping Zheng; Amy Siu-Ngor Fu; Christina Zong-Hao Ma
40558429,Novel Device for Intraoperative Quantitative Measurements of Extraocular Muscle Tensile Strength.,"Understanding the tensile properties of extraocular muscles (EOMs) is crucial for successful strabismus surgery and accurate predictions of surgical outcomes. Assessments of EOM tensile strength are traditionally highly dependent on the expertise of the ophthalmic surgeon, since they involve manually pulling the EOM in opposite directions. This approach only provides subjective measurements that are not quantifiable. Previous quantitative approaches have utilized various devices such as implanted force transducers or dial tension gauges connected to muscle tendons with nylon sutures, but these methods are complex and so are rarely used outside of research settings. Consequently, the goal of this study was to create a quantitative and clinically applicable device for assessing EOM tensile strength. This developed device uses a strabismus hook connected to a strain gauge load cell that measures the tensile force and includes a tilting sensor to ensure that the hook is pulled at a consistent angle when a force is applied. The performance of the device was tested on 22 EOMs in 11 patients with intermittent exotropia during surgery for resecting the medial rectus (MR) and recessing the lateral rectus (LR) under general anesthesia. The measured tensile strengths of the MR and LR were 284.9 ± 58.3 and 278.3 ± 64.6 g (mean ± SD), respectively. In conclusion, the novel device developed in this study for quantitative measurements of EOM tensile strength in clinical settings will facilitate understanding of the pathophysiology of strabismus, as well as of the mechanical properties of the EOMs, and enhance the precision of surgical interventions.",Biosensors,2025,Hyun Jin Shin; Minung Park; Hyunkyoo Kang; Andrew G Lee
40558309,A Neuropsychiatric Prelude to Unveiling Small Cell Lung Cancer with Suspected Paraneoplastic Limbic Encephalitis: A Case Report.,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive form of lung cancer characterized by rapid growth and early metastases. As a neuroendocrine tumour, SCLC is especially notorious for various paraneoplastic syndromes, one of which is a rare neurological syndrome called paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (PLE) that manifests with amnestic cognitive impairment and seizures. Here, we describe a case of a 53-year-old female who presented with neuropsychiatric symptoms of delusions, hallucinations, and cognitive impairment that started months prior to being diagnosed with extensive-stage SCLC. With no previous neuropsychiatric history, this raised the question of whether her presentation was related to PLE rather than a primary psychiatric condition, as initially diagnosed. Her symptoms improved with chemotherapy and radiation treatment of the underlying cancer, favouring a paraneoplastic etiology. Overall, this case underscores the importance of considering paraneoplastic syndromes in patients presenting with new neuropsychiatric symptoms, as early recognition and treatment can improve prognosis.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2025,Jessa Letargo; X Melody Qu; Timothy K Nguyen; Alexander V Louie; Sara Kuruvilla; Enxhi Kotrri
40558288,Population-Based Real-World Outcomes of Post-Operative Adjuvant Brain Cavity Radiotherapy Versus Observation.,"To evaluate the factors influencing the outcomes of patients who underwent surgical resection of brain metastasis followed by either surveillance or post-operative stereotactic radiosurgery/fractionated radiotherapy (SRS/SFRT), a retrospective multi-center chart review was performed on all patients who underwent brain metastases resection in British Columbia between 2018 and 2020. Patients with prior whole-brain radiotherapy were excluded from the study. The primary study endpoints included local recurrence, distant intracranial control, radionecrosis (RN), leptomeningeal disease (LMD), and overall survival (OS). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze survival. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to perform univariable (UVA) and multivariable (MVA) analyses to identify predictors of local control. A total of 113 patients met the inclusion criteria. A total of 31 patients received adjuvant SRS/SFRT to the surgical cavity, while 82 went on observation. The 12-month local control was 69% (50-88%) for the SRS/SFRT cohort and 31% (18-45%) for the observation cohort (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The 12-month distant intracranial control was 44% (26-63%) for the SRS/SFRT cohort and 46% (30-62%) for the observation cohort (<i>p</i> = 0.9). Sensitivity analysis did not show a difference in overall survival (<i>p</i> = 0.6). En bloc resection (<i>p</i> < 0.05), resection without residual disease (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and SRS/SFRT (<i>p</i> < 0.001) were predictive of local control on MVA. Three SRS/SFRT patients (10%) and two observation patients (2%) developed LMD. Four SRS/SFRT patients experienced RN (13%), with no grade 3 or higher toxicities observed. Post-operative SRT outcomes based on real-world population data are consistent with the data from clinical trials and support the established guidelines. For patients requiring surgical resection of brain metastasis, en bloc gross total resection should be encouraged when feasible to reduce local recurrence.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2025,Zhang Hao Jim Li; Linden Lechner; Jennifer Wang; Nan Hui Susan Yao; Andrew Lee; Serge Makarenko; Mostafa Fatehi; Herve H F Choi; Ermias Gete; Fred Hsu; Waseem Sharieff; Shrinivas Rathod; Hannah Carolan; Jessica Chan; Roy Ma; Alan Nichol; Thi Nghiem; Justin Oh
40558230,Administering Parenteral Medications in Managing Patients with Acute Arousal in the Behavioral Assessment Unit of the Emergency Department in Hospital Settings.,"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: The administration of parenteral medications is essential in managing acute arousal within the Behavioral Assessment Unit (BAU) of the emergency department (ED), where timely and effective intervention is critical. This study aims to evaluate current practices surrounding the use of parenteral medications for patients with acute agitation, focusing on adherence to protocols, medication safety, documentation accuracy, and patient outcomes. <b>Methods</b>: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 177 cases from December 2023 to February 2024. The study assessed the demographics, diagnoses, treatment protocols, and patient outcomes, with a particular emphasis on the use of parenteral medications such as benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. The relationship between medication administration and involuntary admission, mechanical restraint usage, and patient outcomes was also explored. <b>Results</b>: The majority of patients were aged between 21 and 30 years, and there was a predominance of male patients across both groups. Schizophrenia was the most common diagnosis, with a higher prevalence in the parenteral group (34%) compared to the oral-only group (24%), and personality disorders were more frequent in the parenteral group. Intramuscular (IM) medication administration was strongly associated with the use of mechanical restraint, with patients receiving IM medication being 35 times more likely to require restraint, emphasizing the link between more intensive treatment approaches and behavioral challenges. The most frequently administered medications were diazepam (40.6%) and olanzapine (36.5%), with olanzapine, droperidol, and diazepam most commonly used parenterally. Documentation of physical assessments prior to parenteral administration was present in most cases, though comprehensive evaluations such as ECGs were inconsistently performed. <b>Conclusions</b>: Parenteral medications, including benzodiazepines and antipsychotics, were effective in rapidly stabilizing patients, but the study emphasizes reducing dependency on mechanical restraints. Tailoring treatment to patient characteristics and employing alternative de-escalation strategies can improve safety and align with recovery-oriented care. This study highlights the need for evidence-based practices to optimize care and improve patient outcomes in ED settings. Further research is needed to explore long-term outcomes and refine non-coercive care approaches.",Clinics and practice,2025,Harshini M Liyanage; Katy Boyce; Yiting Gong; Theresa Koo; Soumitra Das; Naveen Thomas
40558119,Evaluating Obstructive Sleep Apnea Utilizing Arterial Tonometry in Individuals with Cystic Fibrosis.,"Poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness are commonly reported by individuals with cystic fibrosis. The potential impact of comorbid sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), particularly obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), has not been extensively studied in the CF population. At present, there are no specific recommendations available to help clinicians identify patients with CF who are at increased risk of sleep disorders. Home sleep apnea testing using a validated peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) device may offer an accurate diagnosis of OSA in a more convenient and low-cost method than in-lab polysomnography. In this single-center study of 19 adults with CF, we found an increased prevalence of OSA among individuals with CF compared to general population estimates. Although associations with an FEV < 70% predicted and a modified Mallampati score ≥ 3 were observed, these odds ratios did not reach statistical significance, likely reflecting limited power in this small pilot sample. There was no association found between the self-reported presence of nocturnal cough or snoring and OSA. We also found no association between OSA and abnormal scores on commonly used, validated sleep questionnaires, suggesting that CF-specific scales may be needed for effective screening in the CF clinic.",Advances in respiratory medicine,2025,Michelle Chiu; Bethany Bartley; Elizabeth Gootkind; Salma Batool-Anwar; Donald G Keamy; Thomas Bernard Kinane; Lael M Yonker; Kevin S Gipson
40558113,Environmental Factors Affecting Sleep Quality in Intensive Care Unit Patients in Southern Morocco: An Assessment Study.,"Sleep disturbances are a common and often underestimated complication during intensive care unit (ICU) stays. These disturbances can significantly impact patients' recovery and overall well-being. This study aimed to assess the sleep quality of ICU patients and investigate the environmental and clinical factors that affect sleep quality during their ICU stay. We conducted a six-month cross-sectional study involving patients who had stayed in the ICU for at least three nights and were oriented to time and place upon discharge. Sleep quality was assessed using the Arabic version of the Freedman Sleep Questionnaire. Both environmental factors (e.g., noise, light, and nursing interventions) and clinical variables (illness severity and pain) were examined. The differences across three time periods were analyzed using the Wilcoxon test and Spearman's correlation. Multiple regression analysis identified the factors influencing sleep quality. Statistical analyses were performed using JAMOVI software (version 2.3.28). The study enrolled 328 patients, with an average age of 49.74 ± 17.89 years. Of the participants, 75.3% were adults. The primary reasons for admission were circulatory distress (45.73%) and metabolic disorders (24.09%). Sleep quality was significantly lower in the ICU compared to patients' sleep at home (Z = -14.870, <i>p</i> < 0.001). The EVA and APACHE II scores had a statistically significant effect on sleep quality (<i>p</i> < 0.001 and <i>p</i> = 0.015, respectively). In contrast, the Charlson and Quick SOFA scores did not show significant effects (<i>p</i> = 0.128 and <i>p</i> = 0.894). Environmental factors, including noise (<i>p</i> = 0.008), light (<i>p</i> = 0.009), and nursing interventions (<i>p</i> = 0.009), significantly impacted sleep quality. Patients in the ICU generally reported poor sleep quality. Our findings suggest that improving pain management, minimizing environmental noise, and reducing staff-related disturbances could significantly enhance sleep quality for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).",Advances in respiratory medicine,2025,Abdelmajid Lkoul; Keltouma Oumbarek; Youssef Bouchriti; Asmaa Jniene; Tarek Dendane
40558110,"Malnutrition, Sarcopenia, and Malnutrition Sarcopenia Syndrome in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.","<b>Introduction:</b> Idiopathic pulmonaryy fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease with a poor prognosis. While comorbidities like pulmonary hypertension and lung cancer have been studied extensively, less attention has been paid to the implications of malnutrition and sarcopenia in patients with IPF. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of malnutrition, sarcopenia, and the combined malnutrition-sarcopenia syndrome in patients with IPF using the latest diagnostic criteria from the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) and the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2 (EWGSOP2). <b>Methods:</b> A prospective, observational, multicenter study was conducted, focusing on patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). All participants provided informed consent, and the study followed ethical guidelines. Malnutrition was diagnosed based on the GLIM criteria, requiring one phenotypic and one etiological criterion, with muscle mass assessed via bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Sarcopenia was screened following the EWGSOP2 recommendations. The statistical analysis was performed using JAMOVI version 2.3.22, with significance set at <i>p</i> < 0.05. <b>Results:</b> The findings revealed that 77.65% of the participants were malnourished, and 20% had sarcopenia. The malnourished patients had significantly lower body weight, height, and muscle mass compared to the non-malnourished patients. Furthermore, the patients with malnutrition exhibited poorer health-related quality of life scores. This study also identified the malnutrition-sarcopenia syndrome in 8.23% of the participants. <b>Conclusions:</b> Malnutrition, based on the GLIM criteria was identified in three out of four patients with IPF, while sarcopenia according to the EWGSOP2 was present in one out of five.

40558063,Intravenous Immunoglobulin Elevates Regulatory T Cells in Guillain-Barré Syndrome: A Potential Biomarker of Therapeutic Response.,"Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is the primary treatment for Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), yet its immunological mechanisms underlying variable clinical outcomes remain unclear. This study investigated the immunomodulatory effect of IVIg on regulatory T cells (Tregs), cytokines, and their association with treatment response and clinical outcomes. In this prospective case-controlled study, 57 GBS patients and 57 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were investigated. CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Treg percentages, cytokine production (IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-12), and serum C3 levels were measured using flow cytometry, Luminex assay, and turbidimetric methods, respectively. Treatment response was defined as ≥ 1-point GBS-disability score improvement during evaluation. GBS patients exhibited lower CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs frequencies compared to HCs (p = 0.006), which were inversely associated with serum C3 levels (p = 0.003) during the acute phase. At 4 weeks post-onset, patients with normal C3 levels (90-180 mg/dL) exhibited higher Treg frequencies (p = 0.005) compared to acute GBS, whereas patients with persistently elevated C3 levels showed reduced Treg percentage (p = 0.009). Among I VIg-treated patients, Tregs significantly increased at 2 and 4 weeks post-treatment, alongside significantly higher IL-10 and lower TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-12 levels at 4 weeks. However, patients with supportive care showed no such changes in Tregs and cytokine levels. Furthermore, Tregs elevated significantly in patients responsive to IVIg at 2 and 4 weeks (p < 0.05), but not in non-responsive or supportive care patients. IVIg treatment modulates immune dysregulation in GBS by expanding CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs and altering cytokines and serum C3 levels, which are associated with clinical improvement. These findings indicate Tregs as potential biomarkers for monitoring initial clinical response to IVIg in GBS.",Journal of the peripheral nervous system : JPNS,2025,Israt Jahan; Rasel Ahmed; Jigishu Ahmed; Nure Alam Afsar; Pritha Promita Biswas; Sarah Khurshid; Quazi Deen Mohammad; Hubert P Endtz; Ruth Huizinga; Bart C Jacobs; Zhahirul Islam
40558042,[Sample Preparation and Sequencing Efficiency of microRNA Libraries from Pituitary Adenoma Tissue and Blood Plasma of Patients with Acromegaly for the Illumina Platform].,"MicroRNAs in tissues and biological fluids represent a promising class of biomarkers for the molecular diagnostics and therapy of numerous diseases, including oncological diseases.

To explore the potential of microRNAs as prognostic cancer markers and targets for molecular therapy, global microRNA profiling is required, which is provided by next-generation sequencing (NGS). NGS offers high sensitivity, single nucleotide resolution, and the possibility of profiling a large number of samples in parallel. Despite the promising potential of microRNAs as biomarkers and the growing number of works in this area, the literature does not address in sufficient detail the problems associated with sample preparation methods, the specifics of library preparation for microRNA sequencing, and the difficulties of quantitative analysis. Protocols for creating libraries for microRNA sequencing present specific challenges and require selecting conditions for each type of biological sample. Here, we present in detail the preparation of libraries for microRNA sequencing from pituitary adenoma tumor tissue and blood plasma of patients with acromegaly on the Illumina platform. We discuss the difficulties and limitations of the methods and evaluate the effectiveness of sequencing plasma and brain samples. This work can serve as a guide for researchers studying the mechanisms of microRNA regulation in endocrine diseases of the pituitary gland and will also allow for the adaptation of technical procedures for various biological samples in relation to other pathologies.",Molekuliarnaia biologiia,2025,E V Ignatieva; E S Nerubenko; O A Ivanova; U A Tsoy; R I Dmitrieva
40557967,"Hospital Use, Morbidity, and Cancer Risk by Age Group in Neurofibromatosis Type 1: A Nationwide Retrospective Cohort Study.","Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) affects multiple organs progressively, leading to a shortened life expectancy. This study aimed to identify the complications that are prominent in each age group by comparing 28,082 patients with NF1 and 84,246 matched controls. Benign and malignant neoplasms along with neurological complications were the primary contributors to hospital use across most age groups. Respiratory and circulatory disorders were a common cause of hospital use in children and older adults, respectively. Except for soft tissue and central nervous system-originated malignancies, which are well-established NF1-related tumours, the highest rate ratios (RR) of malignancies with statistical significance was observed in the adrenal gland (0-9 years, RR 50.67, 95% CI 6.74-380.76); female genital organs (10-14 years, RR 12.06, 95% CI 1.35-107.93); respiratory and intrathoracic organs (15-19 years, RR 15.10, 95% CI 1.76-129.22; 20-29 years, RR 7.59, 95% CI 2.94-19.56; ≥ 60 years, RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.18-1.61); lip, oral cavity, and pharynx (30-39 years, RR 6.11, 95% CI 1.53-24.42); and bone and articular cartilage (40-49 years, RR 3.06, 95% CI 1.37-6.81; 50-59 years, RR 4.73, 95% CI 2.35-9.50).

40557954,The Influence of Menstrual Cycle Phases on Postconcussion Outcomes and Symptom Reporting: A Scoping Review.,"Concussion is common in sports and often shows sex-based differences in symptom severity and recovery, with female athletes experiencing more severe, prolonged symptoms. Hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle may play a role in concussion, but research on this topic has been limited. Therefore, this scoping review aimed to investigate whether the menstrual cycle phase-both at the time of injury and after injury-influences postconcussion outcomes and symptom reporting, and whether menstrual cycle phases influence baseline assessments in the absence of injury. This review was conducted according to PRISMA-ScR guidelines and included studies on the influence of menstrual cycle phases on concussion-related outcomes retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, and BISp-Surf databases. Five studies involving 774 females identified variations in symptom severity and health outcomes across menstrual cycle phases, with differences between the luteal and follicular phases. Findings suggest that hormonal fluctuations, particularly the withdrawal of elevated progesterone during the luteal phase, may contribute to worse postconcussion symptoms and outcomes, with these hormone levels at the time of injury emerging as a potential predictor of recovery severity. Baseline assessment evaluations should account for menstrual cycle phase, because this influences symptom variability and severity. This review underscores the importance of incorporating menstrual cycle phases into concussion management strategies in order to enhance diagnostic accuracy and recovery approaches for female athletes. Addressing these hormonal influences can advance both research and practice in the management of concussion.",Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,2025,Gina Carr; Marie-Therese Fleddermann
40557918,Digital Mental Health Tools and AI Therapy Chatbots: A Balanced Approach to Regulation.,"Digital mental health tools (DMHTs) offer a potential solution to overcoming economic, cultural, and geographic barriers to the increasing demand for mental health care, but their adoption raises significant ethical, legal, and social concerns. This article identifies ethical risks related to DMHTs and, in this light, proposes three important criteria for evaluating regulatory approaches. These approaches should (a) ensure widespread access and (b) balance access with risk management while (c) acknowledging preexisting markets and digital self-medication. Our analysis of three regulatory models-the laissez-faire approach, a highly regulated approach, and the current U.S. Food and Drug Administration approach-reveals that none satisfactorily balances the promise of access with ethical risks. We therefore suggest modifications to the current FDA approach; these involve a voluntary certification program for nonprescription DMHTs, more-stringent data safety and privacy practices, easily accessible diagnostic tools, continuous monitoring, and independent audits. These modifications secure the accessibility benefits of DMHTs while mitigating risks associated with widespread use.",The Hastings Center report,2025,Amitabha Palmer; David Schwan
40557917,DWORF expression is reduced in a large animal model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal muscle-wasting disease driven by cytosolic calcium overload, which leads to muscle degeneration. Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA), a key regulator of cytosolic calcium levels, exhibits reduced activity in animal models of DMD and human patients. Dwarf open reading frame (DWORF), a positive SERCA regulator, is downregulated in mdx DMD mice, and adeno-associated virus-mediated DWORF overexpression has been shown to ameliorate DMD cardiomyopathy. The canine DMD model provides a crucial bridge for translating findings from mice to humans. To investigate DWORF expression in this model, we developed a canine-specific anti-DWORF antibody, as the existing murine antibody is ineffective. This antibody detected DWORF in human, pig, cat and rabbit muscle, but not in mouse muscle. DWORF was absent in muscle tissues of neonatal normal dogs but highly expressed in those of adult dogs. In DMD-affected dogs aged 8 months or older, DWORF expression was significantly reduced in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. This study establishes a foundation for evaluating DWORF-based gene therapy in the canine DMD model, advancing the potential for clinical translation.",Disease models & mechanisms,2025,Aaron M Gibson; Xiufang Pan; Omar Brito-Estrada; James A Teixeira; Lauren K Carl; Yongping Yue; Michael L Kamradt; Matthew J Burke; Caris A Wadding-Lee; Gang Yao; Roland W Herzog; Dongsheng Duan; Catherine A Makarewich
40557910,"Characteristics of Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) in drug-naïve patients with narcolepsy type 1 and type 2, and relationship with other measures of sleepiness.","We aimed to describe the characteristics of standard maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT), outside of clinical trials, in a sample of drug-naïve patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) and type 2 (NT2). Consecutive drug-naïve patients with narcolepsy underwent two days of continuous PSG recording, the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), then night-PSG and, on the following day, MWT. MWT results were correlated with MSLT and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Patients in the two lower tertiles of MWT mean sleep latency (mSL) were compared to those in the upper tertile. Seventy-eight NT1 (30.6 ± 11.4 years, 35 males) and 19 NT2 (31.0 ± 9.9 years, 12 males) were included. MWT results showed a bimodal distribution with a large peak with reduced mSL and a small peak with values towards 40 minutes. MWT mSL was lower in NT1 than in NT2 (10.7 ± 10.8 min vs 23.9 ± 11.5 min, p<.001). In the entire sample, lower MWT mSL was moderately correlated with lower MSLT mSL (Rho = 0.347, p=.001) and higher ESS (Rho = -0.398, p<.001). Patients with NT1 with MWT mSL in the two lower tertiles (≤11.2 min) had higher ESS than those in the upper tertile, without any difference in other clinical or neurophysiological features. In NT2, no significant correlations emerged between MWT, MSLT, and ESS. MWT mSL is reduced in drug-naive narcolepsy, more severely in NT1 than in NT2. However, a minority of patients show normal MWT results. MSLT, MWT, and ESS measure different aspects of sleepiness in narcolepsy, and none can be considered a comprehensive measure of its severity.",Sleep,2025,Biscarini Francesco; Pizza Fabio; Vandi Stefano; Mazzoni Alice; Barateau Lucie; Mignot Emmanuel; Dauvilliers Yves; Plazzi Giuseppe
40557879,"Efficacy and Safety of Daridorexant in Chinese Patients with Insomnia Disorder: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase III Clinical Trial.","To evaluate the efficacy and safety of daridorexant in Chinese patients with insomnia disorder. This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial in China. Adults aged 18-75 years meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5®) criteria for insomnia disorder, with a baseline Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) ≥15, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive daridorexant 50 mg or placebo once every evening for 1 month. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to month 1 in wake time after sleep onset (WASO) assessed by polysomnography (PSG). The secondary endpoints included the change from baseline to month 1 in subjective total sleep time (sTST) and in latency to persistent sleep (LPS). In addition to the standardized collection of AEs, safety data specific to insomnia treatment were assessed as follows: withdrawal symptoms, rebound insomnia, and next-day residual effects. 206 participants were enrolled and evenly randomized to each group. Compared with the placebo group, the daridorexant group showed a significant reduction in WASO (-15.4 min, p=.0009), a significant increase in sTST (16.8 min, p=.021) and a significant reduction in LPS (geometric mean ratio to placebo 0.7, p=.001) from baseline to month 1. The proportion of participants reporting AEs during double-blind treatment was generally comparable between two groups (21.6% vs. 18.4%), with no notable safety signals observed. No withdrawal symptoms, rebound insomnia, and next-day residual effects were observed. Daridorexant 50 mg significantly improved both objective and subjective sleep outcomes in Chinese patients with insomnia disorder, with a favorable safety profile.",Sleep,2025,Zhaoyang Huang; Hanqiao Wang; Bin Zhang; Chenyu Li; Jian Wang; Lijun Xu; Qiaorong Xu; Jingxu Chen; Li Xiao; Zan Wang; Bei Wang; Yan Jiang; Yunlin Liu; Chengmei Yuan; Qinying Ma; Juncang Wu; Xin Liu; Yuansheng Huang; Hao Cui; Feng Wang; Yuping Wang
40557874,Maraviroc Prevents Optic Nerve Injury-Induced Retinal Ganglion Cell Apoptosis by Modulating the CCL5/CCR5/CTSS Axis.,"Optic nerve crush (ONC) is an animal model that induces optic nerve injury and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death, which is partly mediated by activated microglia secreting cytokines. This study explores the role of the CCL5/CCR5 pathway in RGC damage and evaluates maraviroc, a CCR5 inhibitor, as a potential therapeutic agent. Bioinformatic analysis of glaucoma datasets (GSE142881 and GSE26299) identified Ccr5 as a key gene linked to acute or chronic RGC injury. The ONC model was used to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of maraviroc or sh-Ccr5 using immunofluorescence, TUNEL staining, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and electrophysiological tests. Co-culture of neuro2a cells with activated BV2 cells examined mechanisms, and intravitreal maraviroc safety and efficacy were evaluated using histological and molecular assays. CCR5 was significantly associated with RGC injury in both datasets. Inhibition of CCR5 via maraviroc preserved RGC structure, maintained ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness, and improved retinal function in the ONC model. Mechanistically, CCR5 inhibition prevented Cathepsin S (CTSS) downregulation and neuron apoptosis induced by ONC or activated microglia. Intravitreal maraviroc administration was safe, preserving retinal structure and RGC count in non-injured eyes while reducing RGC damage in ONC-injured eyes. Microglial activation in glaucoma upregulates CCL5, triggering CCR5-mediated RGC apoptosis via CTSS downregulation. Maraviroc effectively reduces RGC death and optic nerve damage, offering a promising neuroprotective strategy for treatment of optic nerve injury.",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,2025,Jingqiu Huang; Zhaohui Chang; Lian Liu; Cheng Lai; Xizhi Deng; Bin Jiang; Min Ke
40557858,Cross-sectoral collaboration of mental health problems in children and adolescents.,"A growing number of children and adolescents (CA) suffer from mental health problems. To provide the necessary investigation and care, collaboration between general practitioners (GPs) and the municipality is essential, but often challenging. This study aimed to identify factors influencing intersectoral collaboration between general practice and municipalities when treating CA with mental health problems and to propose improvements to this collaboration. We conducted interviews with seven GPs and three municipal employees (MEs). The data were analysed with inspiration from thematic analysis. The results were framed within Gittell's theory of relational coordination. GPs and MEs expressed frustration and challenges encountered when working with CA due to inefficient intersectoral collaboration. Many GPs expressed a need for better communication with municipal authorities or child psychiatry departments. MEs also experienced challenges related to this collaboration. Successful collaboration appeared when dedicated individuals from both sectors actively worked for improvements. Key factors identified for enhancing collaboration included personal knowledge, regular contact, awareness of activities in the other sector and improved communication channels. We propose enhanced cross-sectoral communication, routine information exchange and further development of digital tools to improve collaboration. Formalising collaboration through specific agreements is also recommended. ""PLU-fonden"" and ""Sara Krabbes Legat"" TRIAL REGISTRATION.

40557830,"Peripheral venous blood gas analysis for the diagnosis of respiratory failure, hypercarbia and metabolic disturbance in adults.","Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) is the reference standard for the diagnosis of respiratory failure (RF) and metabolic disturbance (MD), but peripheral venous blood gas analysis (PVBGA) is increasingly being used for the estimation of carbon dioxide, pH, and other variables in the context of acutely unwell adults presenting to hospitals and emergency departments. The primary objective of this review is to evaluate the performance of PVBGA by comparing it with the reference standard ABGA, which is assumed to be error-free for the diagnosis of (1) respiratory failure, (2) hypercarbia, and (3) metabolic disturbance (the three target conditions) in adults. The secondary objective is to evaluate the performance of the index test to diagnose nine specific subtypes of respiratory failure and metabolic disturbance. The definitions for these additional conditions are determined by changes to one or more of the following: pH (acidity), pO<sub>2</sub> (partial pressure of oxygen), pCO<sub>2</sub> (partial pressure of carbon dioxide), HCO<sub>3</sub> (bicarbonate), as stated in the Methods section of this review (target conditions). We aimed to explore the following covariates: participant demographics (e.g. age, weight, and sex); participant comorbidities (e.g. chronic lung disease, chest wall deformity, and central nervous system disorder such as spinal cord injury); and the indication for blood gas sampling (e.g. shortness of breath, critical illness, resuscitation, trauma, or whilst under general anaesthesia). On 10 July 2024, we searched the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and LILACS. We also manually searched 19 respiratory and critical care journals, and we searched ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials. We considered consecutive series studies and case-control studies that directly compared the index test PVBGA to the reference standard ABGA for adults over the age of 16 years. The included studies contained data for any one of the target conditions of respiratory failure and metabolic disturbance, as determined by individual changes to pO<sub>2</sub> (partial pressure of oxygen), pCO<sub>2</sub> (partial pressure of carbon dioxide), pH (acidity), and HCO<sub>3</sub> (bicarbonate) concentration. Studies that only provided mean values for summed data were ineligible for inclusion. However, we invited authors of such studies to provide individual patient data for inclusion in this systematic review. There are nine studies awaiting classification. Two authors independently evaluated the quality of the relevant studies and extracted data from them. We conducted a quality assessment using the QUADAS-2 tool. Our statistical analysis used 2 x 2 tables for the positive and negative results of each test. We estimated a bivariate meta-analysis of sensitivity and specificity. We included six studies (919 participants) in our quantitative analysis. All studies were at high risk of bias due to one or more of the following factors: patient selection, since it was unclear if consecutive patients were included or where they were located; index test, with poor reporting of cut-offs; flow and timing domain because the fraction of inspired oxygen was frequently not stated and any difference between the collection of the VBGA and the ABGA could introduce bias. Respiratory failure For the diagnosis of respiratory failure of any type, when using PVBGA, the estimated summary sensitivity (Sn) was 97.6% (95% credible interval (CI) 94.1 to 99.4) and the estimated summary specificity (Sp) was 36.9% (95% CI 17.1 to 60.1) (6 studies, 805 participants of whom 291 (36%) were diagnosed with respiratory failure by ABGA; sensitivity: low-certainty evidence; specificity: very low certainty evidence). Isolated hypercarbia For the diagnosis of isolated hypercarbia (regardless of oxygen level), when using PVBGA, the estimated summary Sn was 97.1% (95% CI 93.3 to 99.2); the estimated summary Sp value was 53.9% (95% CI 39.8 to 66.7) (6 studies with 805 participants, 269 (33%) with ABGA confirmation; low-certainty evidence). Other findings Results for metabolic disturbance and our secondary target conditions are presented in the full review. Very limited data suggest PVBGA performs poorly as a diagnostic test for respiratory failure compared to the reference standard of ABGA. The index test PVBGA was highly sensitive for the diagnosis of respiratory failure and isolated hypercarbia, but its specificity was poor for these two primary target conditions. The high sensitivity means PVBGA may have a useful role as a ""rule out test"" for respiratory failure and isolated hypercarbia; however, the high false-positive rates make the clinical interpretation of a positive test difficult. Moreover, we are uncertain regarding these estimates because we have only low to very low certainty about the evidence. Further studies that use (ABGA) established thresholds for the diagnosis of each target condition are needed.",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2025,Anthony L Byrne; Nathan L Pace; Paul S Thomas; Rebecca L Symons; Robindro Chatterji; Michael Bennett
40557606,Centering Impact and Equity in the Next 50 Years of Eating Disorder Research.,"Over the past 50 years, there has been a significant increase in research on eating disorders, which is encouraging and necessary given the substantial mortality, morbidity, and personal and societal costs of these common conditions. However, improvements in prevention, treatment access, and outcomes have been slow, and research priorities have not always been aligned with the needs and interests of affected communities. In this commentary, we call on the field to think critically about how to maximize not only the volume but also the real-world impact of the next 50 years of eating disorder research. In particular, we highlight the importance of creating a research ecosystem that nurtures methodological diversity and centers collaborative, participatory research in partnership with people with lived experience. We also underscore the importance of conducting inclusive research that makes space for the full diversity of eating disorder presentations and the people who experience them. Ultimately, we argue that creativity and commitment will be required along with shifts in training, academic incentives, and broader structures to realize the full potential of research to enhance the lives of those with eating disorders.",The International journal of eating disorders,2025,Megan E Mikhail; C Blair Burnette

40557529,Brain-Body Interactions in Ischemic Stroke: VNS Reprograms Microglia and FNS Enhances Cerebellar Neuroprotection.,"Stroke significantly impacts mortality and long-term disability, necessitating effective rehabilitation strategies to enhance recovery. This review examines the roles of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and fastigial nucleus stimulation (FNS) in facilitating ischemic stroke recovery through brain-body interactions. VNS enhances ischemic stroke recovery by reprogramming microglia from proinflammatory (M1) to neuroprotective (M2) phenotypes, reducing neuroinflammation and promoting tissue repair via neurotrophic factors. It has shown promise in clinically improving chronic upper limb deficits when combined with rehabilitation therapies. Conversely, FNS provides cerebellar-mediated neuroprotection by mainly mitigating excitotoxic damage and inflammatory responses independent of cerebral blood flow alterations, as evidenced by preclinical models of middle cerebral artery occlusion. By integrating VNS-driven immunomodulation with FNS-mediated excitotoxicity suppression, this review highlights their synergistic potential to improve rehabilitation outcomes for ischemic stroke survivors. Biomarker-guided protocols: VNS for cortical/subcortical ischemic deficits and FNS for cerebellar network recovery are advocated to address postischemic disability via anti-inflammatory rewiring, neuroplasticity enhancement, and cerebellar-thalamocortical circuit stabilization. Critical gaps remain in hemorrhagic stroke, where FNS's excitotoxicity suppression may destabilize clots, necessitating subtype-specific safety validations.",Stroke,2025,Yuchun Wang; Zhe Yang; Jinling Wang; Minyan Ge; Nianhong Wang; Shumao Xu
40557524,Associations Between Tinnitus and Hearing Loss Among Noise-Exposed Workers in the United States From 1999 to 2020: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"ImportanceTinnitus is a prevalent condition among noise-exposed workers, with significant implications for hearing health and quality of life. Identifying associated factors can inform prevention and management strategies.ObjectivesTo identify factors associated with tinnitus prevalence among noise-exposed workers and assess the effectiveness of hearing protection in mitigating tinnitus.DesignCross-sectional study.SettingData from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys database.ParticipantsThis study included 4931 noise-exposed workers (mean age 48.9 ± 0.3 years). Participants were categorized into speech-frequency hearing loss (SFHL; n = 1032, mean age 67.2 ± 0.4 years) and high-frequency hearing loss (HFHL; n = 1634, mean age 62.9 ± 0.3 years) groups based on hearing threshold levels.Intervention or ExposuresNoise exposure duration, hearing loss severity, demographics, and medical history. Hearing protection usage was assessed for its effectiveness in preventing tinnitus.Main Outcome MeasuresPrimary outcome: tinnitus prevalence. Associations were analyzed using logistic regression, with factors including self-reported noise exposure, hearing loss severity, demographics, and medical history.ResultTinnitus prevalence was 32.85% in the group with SFHL and 29.99% in the group with HFHL. Prolonged noise exposure and greater hearing loss severity were associated with tinnitus in both groups. Hearing protection usage was potentially linked to a lower tinnitus prevalence in HFHL but not in SFHL. For SFHL, univariate analysis showed lower tinnitus prevalence in older age and females, while Caucasian ethnicity and higher income were associated with higher prevalence. Multivariate analysis indicated that older age was positively associated with tinnitus (<i>P</i> < .05). In HFHL, factors such as higher BMI, higher educational level, and elevated Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9) scores were significantly associated with tinnitus prevalence.ConclusionsProlonged noise exposure and hearing loss severity among noise-exposed workers were associated with tinnitus prevalence in SFHL and HFHL. Hearing protection showed tendency to reduce tinnitus prevalence in HFHL but had a limited effect in SFHL. Higher BMI, higher education levels, and elevated PHQ9 scores were significantly associated with tinnitus in HFHL, warranting further research into protective strategies.RelevanceFuture studies should explore alternative protective strategies for SFHL patients and refine tinnitus prevention approaches in noise-exposed workers.",Journal of otolaryngology - head & neck surgery = Le Journal d'oto-rhino-laryngologie et de chirurgie cervico-faciale,2025,Shuo-Wei Yang; Wei Xu; Lin Chen; Shu-Bin Fang
40557431,Anatomical classification of septum pellucidum variations and analysis of the co-occurrence of the variations with psychiatric disorders.,"This study sought to categorize anatomical variations of the septum pellucidum (SP), cavum vergae (CV), and cavum veli interpositi (CVI), as well as to examine potential correlations between these variations and psychiatric disorders. A total of 2949 patients were retrospectively analyzed utilizing brain MRIs. Variations were categorized into nine types according to the coexistence of CSP and CVI in either mild or moderate manifestations. The prevalence of CSP, CV, and CVI in the study population was 7.9%, 1.4%, and 9.0%, respectively, with an overall occurrence of variation at 13.8%. A chi-square test indicated a significant correlation between moderate CSP with mild CVI (Type VIII) and a reduced prevalence of psychiatric disorders (<i>p</i> = .007), implying a possible protective effect. Nevertheless, the majority of SP variations exhibited no statistically significant correlation with psychiatric diagnoses, including schizophrenia, OCD, or bipolar disorder. Logistic regression analysis revealed a significant interaction between gender and SP variations in predicting psychiatric disorders, with females exhibiting a higher overall prevalence. The interaction term was statistically significant (<i>p</i> < .001), suggesting that variations in SP and gender collectively affect the probability of psychiatric disorders. The findings offer valuable insights; however, limitations including the retrospective design, small subgroup sizes, and absence of genetic data necessitate caution in result interpretation. This study enhances comprehension of SP variations and their possible involvement in psychiatric disorders, emphasizing the necessity for additional research to clarify the underlying neurobiological mechanisms and clinical ramifications.",The neuroradiology journal,2025,Bilge Kuru; Istemihan Coban; Fulya Yaprak; Osman Hasan Tahsin Kilic; Orkun Sarioglu; Berna Dirim Mete

Given the increasing need to expand the basic knowledge of brain pathophysiology for disease biomarker discovery, we set the goal to quantify bilirubin and biliverdin in human CSF. Their concentrations are expected to reflect the level of brain heme catabolism, a key pathway involved in the biological response to oxidative stress. Here, we present the results of the CSF analysis by a specific and sensitive fluorometric method using the recombinant fusion protein HELP-UnaG (HUG).

40557328,Subtle changes in Purkinje cell firing in Purkinje cell-specific <i>Dyt1 ΔGAG</i> knock-in mice.,"DYT1 dystonia is an inherited early-onset generalized dystonia characterized by sustained muscle contractions causing abnormal, repetitive movements or postures. Most DYT1 patients have a heterozygous trinucleotide GAG deletion (<i>ΔGAG</i>) in <i>DYT1/TOR1A</i>, coding for torsinA. <i>Dyt1</i> heterozygous ΔGAG knock-in (KI) mice or global KI mice show motor deficits and abnormal Purkinje cell firing. However, Purkinje cell-specific heterozygous ΔGAG conditional KI mice (Pcp2-KI) show improved motor performance, reduced sensory-evoked brain activation in the striatum and midbrain, and reduced functional connectivity of the striatum with the anterior medulla. Whether Pcp2-KI mice show similar abnormal Purkinje cell firing as the global KI mice, suggesting a cell-autonomous effect causes the abnormal Purkinje cell firing in the global KI mice, is unknown. We used acute cerebellar slice recording in Pcp2-KI mice to address this issue. The Pcp2-KI mice exhibited no changes in spontaneous firing and intrinsic excitability compared to the control mice. While membrane properties were largely unchanged, the resting membrane potential was slightly hyperpolarized, which was associated with decreased baseline excitability. Our results suggest that the abnormal Purkinje cell firing in the global KI mice was not cell-autonomous and was caused by physiological changes elsewhere in the brain circuits. Our results also contribute to the ongoing research of how basal ganglia and cerebellum interact to influence motor control in normal states and movement disorders.","Dystonia (Lausanne, Switzerland)",2025,Hong Xing; Pallavi Girdhar; Yuning Liu; Fumiaki Yokoi; David E Vaillancourt; Yuqing Li
40557281,Lactate levels during anesthesia in patients undergoing craniopharyngioma surgery.,"To assess the incidence of hyperlactatemia and lactic acidosis in patients undergoing craniopharyngioma surgery and to investigate their association with surgical outcomes. We analyzed clinical data from all patients who underwent craniopharyngioma surgery between 2019 and 2023 at a tertiary care center. Arterial blood gas analyses were performed prior to anesthesia and at one-hour intervals during surgery. Patients were classified into three groups: the Lactic Acidosis group (LA), Hyperlactatemia group (HL), and Normal Control group (NC). The primary outcome was the occurrence of postoperative severe hypernatremia (serum sodium levels exceeding 155 mmol/L). We enrolled 261 patients with a mean age of 41.7 years. During anesthesia, mean lactate levels increased from 1.4 [1.0-1.9] mmol/L at initiation to 4.6 [1.8-7.0] mmol/L after 8 h. Among the cohort, 44 patients (16.9%) were classified in the HL group and 31 patients (11.9%) in the LA group. Anesthesia duration was the sole factor significantly associated with increased lactate levels in both univariate and multivariable analyses (OR 1.50 [95% CI: 1.31-1.80], <i>p</i> < 0.001). The elevated lactate level was independently associated with hypernatremia, even after adjusting for potential confounders, with an odds ratio of 2.12 (95% CI: 1.04-4.24, <i>p</i> = 0.038). No significant differences were observed among the three groups regarding total hospital stay, ICU stay, or incidence of severe complications. Lactate levels increased during anesthesia in patients undergoing craniopharyngioma surgery and were associated with postoperative hypernatremia. However, with appropriate management, lactic acidosis was not significantly linked to adverse postoperative outcomes.",Frontiers in surgery,2025,Xiaoxu Shen; Xiaoyun Cao; Xuehua Che; Kaiyu Wang; Nidan Qiao

The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 and Insomnia Severity Index were used to measure psychological symptoms and sleep problems, respectively. Heart rate variability was measured by the ANSWatch. <b>Results:</b> No significant differences were reported in preintervention scores. After the 4-week intervention, the intervention group scored significantly lower in insomnia (4.3 vs. 12.6, respectively; <i>p</i> < 0.001), depression (2.5 vs. 7.9, <i>p</i> < 0.001), anxiety (3.1 vs. 9.2, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and stress (5.6 vs. 12, <i>p</i> < 0.001) than those in the controls. No significant differences were observed in heart rate variability between the two groups. <b>Conclusion:</b> Low-level light-emitting diode light therapy improved sleep quality in shift-work nurses with insomnia and alleviated depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms; however, it did not improve heart rate variability, possibly because of the short intervention duration and the ongoing shift-work schedule. <b>Implications for Nursing Management:</b> Employers could consider providing phototherapy for shift nurses to improve their health. <b>Trial Registration:</b> ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05146596.",Journal of nursing management,2025,Yung-Hsuan Liao; Chen-Jei Tai; Jin-Lain Ming; Li-Hwa Lin; Li-Yin Chien
40557161,Case Report: Therapeutic effect of efgartigimod in refractory anti-GQ1b antibody syndrome coexisting with myasthenia gravis.,"Anti-GQ1b antibody syndrome is a spectrum of autoimmune neurological disorders that includes Miller Fisher syndrome, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) with ophthalmoplegia, Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis, and acute ophthalmoplegia without ataxia. These conditions are characterized by the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies targeting GQ1b gangliosides. The coexistence of anti-GQ1b antibody syndrome and myasthenia gravis (MG) is rare and presents diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. We report the case of an 84-year-old Japanese man with overlapping features of both disorders, describing his clinical course and response to add-on treatment with the neonatal Fc receptor antagonist efgartigimod. He presented with fever and diarrhea, followed by acute limb weakness. He was initially suspected of having had a stroke but was later diagnosed with GBS based on areflexia, anti-ganglioside antibody positivity, and nerve conduction abnormalities. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy was initiated but his condition worsened, leading to respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation. Subsequently, bilateral ptosis and eye movement dysfunction emerged, prompting the consideration of MG. Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies and tensilon test results were positive and high-dose methylprednisolone was administered, resulting in partial improvement. Plasmapheresis was performed, but profound limb weakness and respiratory failure persisted; intravenous efgartigimod was thus introduced. Remarkably, the patient's respiratory function improved within 7 days, leading to ventilator weaning, and his limb weakness showed notable recovery. After a second cycle of efgartigimod, the patient regained speech and independent mobility, allowing transfer to a rehabilitation facility. His case underscores the diagnostic complexity of overlapping anti-GQ1b antibody syndrome and MG, and it highlights the therapeutic potential of efgartigimod in treating refractory cases of overlapping autoimmune neuromuscular syndromes. Given the rapid efficacy of efgartigimod for improving both respiratory and motor functions in this case, it is apparent that efgartigimod can be a valuable therapeutic option in complex neuromuscular autoimmune conditions.",Frontiers in immunology,2025,Keiko Watanabe; Seiya Takahashi; Akane Kanda; Takuya Watanabe; Yuki Kakinuma; Satoshi Yano; Ryuta Kinno
40557153,Research progress on composite nerve guidance conduits with immune-regulatory functions.,"Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) has emerged as a critical clinical challenge due to its high disability rate and socioeconomic burden. Traditional autologous nerve grafting, limited by donor shortages and risks of secondary surgeries, has driven tissue-engineered nerve conduits to become a research hotspot. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in immunomodulatory nerve conduits, focusing on the biological properties, degradation mechanisms, and pivotal roles of natural materials (e.g., collagen, chitosan, silk fibroin) and synthetic materials (e.g., poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), polylactic acid (PLA), and polycaprolactone (PCL) in regulating macrophage polarization. The potential of composite materials to synergistically optimize mechanical performance and bioactivity of nerve conduits is also discussed. Furthermore, this review envisions future trends in nerve conduits, including the integration of 4D printing, smart-responsive systems, and personalized designs to overcome current therapeutic limitations. By integrating multidisciplinary perspectives from materials science, immunology, and regenerative medicine, this review aims to provide innovative theoretical frameworks and technical pathways for efficiently repairing PNI, advancing clinical translation.",Frontiers in immunology,2025,Shuxuan Zhang; Xinyue Sun; Xuewa Yang; Yulan Fan; Yuxin Liang; Jiaying Li; Jue Ling
40557147,B cell-extrinsic and intrinsic factors linked to early immune repletion after anti-CD20 therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis of African ancestry.,"Recent investigations have identified patients of African ancestry (AA) with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), who display more rapid B-cell repopulation after standard semi-annual infusions with an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody for B cell depletion. In this study, we explored the immunologic and genetic factors, with, serum drug monitoring that may contribute to a faster rate of B-cell repletion that follows during recovery from treatment with anti-CD20 antibody. In AA MS patients treated with an anti-CD20 antibody that had early repopulation of peripheral blood B cells, we assessed for extrinsic factors, including the presence of anti-drug antibodies against ocrelizumab, which may contribute to early repletion. We also documented the associated serum drug levels. In addition, we examined for inheritance of intrinsic gene polymorphisms associated with B cell survival and immune function. Our findings identified a subset of AA patients with early B cell repletion after anti-CD20 treatment associated with anti-drug antibodies and an absence of detectable drug. Furthermore, a separate set of AA patients with the early B cell repletion phenotype without anti-drug antibodies had significant over-representation of genetic polymorphisms that map to genes for the B cell survival factor, BAFF, to antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, and to pathways involved in inflammation, leukocyte activation and B cell differentiation. In AA patients with MS, after anti-CD20 antibody treatment we found an unexpected high occurrence of early B cell replenishment. This was associated with the presence of anti-drug antibodies and/or specific genetic polymorphisms. Larger studies are now needed to determine whether these factors may lead to impaired therapeutic benefits of B cell targeted therapy and clinical progression, and these findings may be useful to guide future optimized personalized therapeutic strategies.",Frontiers in immunology,2025,Gregg J Silverman; Abhimanyu N Amarnani; Arnaldo A Armini; Angie Kim; Hannah Kopinsky; David Fenyo; Ilya Kister
40557144,Multiple sclerosis: etiology in the context of neurovascular unit and immune system involvement and advancements with <i>in vitro</i> blood-brain barrier models.,"Multiple sclerosis affects a significant portion of the world's adult population and is the most common nontraumatic neuroimmunology disorder. Although the specific etiology of multiple sclerosis remains unknown, it has been associated with autoimmune components. While current treatment options relieve some symptoms in MS patients, most are immunosuppressive and only delay the progression of the disease without conferring definitive curative measures. Hence, a thorough understanding of disease pathobiology, the contribution of the neurovascular unit (NVU), and biological body-on-a-chip systems that replicate the blood-brain barrier may open new horizons for the discovery of potential therapeutics for MS.",Frontiers in immunology,2025,Aya A El-Taibany; Parichehr Heydarian; Daniel A Porada; Michael C Seeds; Anthony Atala
40557136,Cross-frequency coupling between low frequency and gamma oscillations altered in cognitive biotype of depression.,"The cognitive biotype of depression has been conceptualized as a distinct subtype characterized by unique distinct neural correlates and specific clinical features. Abnormal neural oscillations related to cognitive dysfunction have been extensively studied, with particular attention given to gamma oscillations due to their crucial role in neurocircuit operations, emotional processing, and cognitive functions. Nevertheless, cross-frequency coupling between low frequency and gamma oscillations in the cognitive biotype of depression have yet to be fully elucidated. The study identified the cognitive biotype in depression by MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). We enrolled 141 depressed patients in remission, including 56 identified as cognitive biotype and 85 as the non-cognitive impairment subgroup. Cross-frequency coupling between low frequency and gamma oscillations were analyzed using specific computational methods based on the data collected by Electroencephalogram (EEG). Furthermore, we did correlation analysis to explore the relationship between cross-frequency coupling of neural oscillations with cognitive function in depression. We found that phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) values decreased in cognitive biotype. Specifically, cross-frequency coupling between theta (Pz: t =-3.512, FDR-corrected p = 0.011), alpha (P3: t =-3.377, FDR-corrected p = 0.009; Pz: t =-3.451, FDR-corrected p = 0.009), beta (P3: t =-3.129, FDR-corrected p = 0.020; Pz: t =-3.333, FDR-corrected p = 0.020) with low gamma decreased at eyes-closed state in cognitive biotype. However, cross-frequency coupling between delta with gamma increased in cognitive biotype (P4: <i>t</i> = 3.314, FDR-corrected p = 0.022) While cross-frequency coupling exhibited no significant differences at eyes-opened state in two subgroups (FDR-corrected p > 0.05). Furthermore, significant correlations between cognitive function and cross-frequency coupling at eyes-closed state were observed. These results indicated that the cross-frequency coupling between low frequency and gamma occurred in the parietal lobe in cognitive biotype of depression. These results advance the understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits and highlight potential biomarkers for precision depression.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2025,Hongli Wang; Xiaoning Shi; Chenyang Wang; Yongsheng Qi; Michel Gao; Yingying Zhao
40557134,Stigmatisation of survivors of political persecution in the GDR: attitudes of healthcare professionals.,"People with mental disorders face various barriers on the road to treatment. People who have experienced injustice of the state apparatus of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in the form of various reprisals are a group that has received insufficient attention in research. Some of them still show long-term psychological and physical consequences that occur more frequently than in the general population, resulting in an increased need for treatment. There are currently no studies on how those affected are perceived by practitioners due to their history and whether they are exposed to stigmatizing attitudes. A vignette-based survey was carried out to identify possible stigmatising attitudes. An independent opinion and survey institute conducted the study in three phases in December 2022, April 2023 and May to August 2024 using an online survey. A total of <i>N</i>=1357 practitioners from the German healthcare system were presented one of four case vignettes. The two vignettes described a person with mental health difficulties who had either experienced an unremarkable socialization in the GDR (A) or had suffered injustice in the GDR (B). In addition to socio-demographic variables, stereotypes, emotional reactions and desire for social distance towards the person described were recorded. Age and sex as well as subjective knowledge about the GDR, the occupational group and the working environment influence the intensity of emotional reactions as well as the desire for social distance and the extent of negative stereotypical attitudes. The presentation of a case vignette that deals with an experience of SED injustice favours a decrease in positive and an increase in negative stereotypes. The explanatory power of the regression models is predominantly in the medium range (from 9.7 till 35.3%). Even more than three decades after the reunification of Germany, people with mental health problems and an experience of SED injustice in the GDR still experience stigmatizing attitudes on the part of those treating them. Stigmatizing attitudes can affect treatment and care.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2025,Tobias Schott; Marie Blume; Anne Weiß; Christian Sander; Georg Schomerus
40557109,Uncovering the truth about cat-scratch disease.,"Cat-scratch disease (CSD) is a systemic infection caused by the facultative, rod-shaped, nonmotile, Gram-negative, intracellular zoonotic bacillus <i>Bartonella henselae</i>. The bacteria responsible for CSD were not discovered until decades after the condition was first characterized in 1931. The prevalence of CSD is more common in warm, humid areas and is typically seasonal, peaking in the fall and winter. The pathogenesis of CSD starts when a tiny wound from an infected cat's bite or scratch allows the bacteria <i>B. henselae</i> to enter the human body. The innate immune system, which includes neutrophils and macrophages, is activated as an initial reaction. Histological examination of skin lesions and lymph nodes in immunocompetent people early in the clinical phase of CSD revealed lymphoid hyperplasia and arteriolar proliferation. The best initial test for CSD is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or an indirect fluorescence assay. Bacteremia is typically asymptomatic in cats that are naturally infected with <i>B. henselae</i>. In humans, <i>B. henselae</i> can spread and infect the liver, spleen, eyes, and central nervous system in certain people. Cat fleas (<i>Ctenocephalides felis</i>) are the main vectors of <i>B. henselae</i> transmission. The zoonotic nature of CSD makes it a public health concern because it can be transmitted from cats to people. Treatment strategies for <i>Bartonella</i> infections differ according to the patient's immunological status and clinical signs. The research on the effectiveness of antibiotics in vitro and in vivo differs significantly. Eliminating fleas from cats and preventing severe injuries from cats are two ways to prevent CSD.",Open veterinary journal,2025,Yulianna Puspitasari; Aswin Rafif Khairullah; Hartanto Mulyo Raharjo; Ima Fauziah; Wiwiek Tyasningsih; Dea Anita Ariani Kurniasih; Muhammad Khaliim Jati Kusala; Ikechukwu Benjamin Moses; Bantari Wisynu Kusuma Wardhani; Kartika Afrida Fauzia; Katty Hendriana Priscilia Riwu; Riza Zainuddin Ahmad; Sheila Marty Yanestria; Syahputra Wibowo; Arif Nur Muhammad Ansori; Ilma Fauziah Ma'ruf
40557096,"Botulism type C outbreak in free-ranging wild birds in a public urban park in Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo state, Brazil.","Botulism is a neurological disease caused by the ingestion of the toxin produced by <i>Clostridium botulinum</i>. This bacterium is globally distributed, infects mainly mammals and birds, and is present in both the intestinal microbiota and the environment. The most frequently observed clinical manifestation is flaccid paralysis of the skeletal muscles, which can rapidly progress to death due to cardiorespiratory failure. Diagnosis is performed through clinical, environmental, and laboratory findings, mainly by mouse bioassay seroneutralization, which serves as the gold standard. During the seasonal period, approximately 30-60 dead or sick animals were found in an urban park in Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil, between late 2020 and 2021. However, only four wild ducks (<i>Cairina moschata</i>) and one great egret (<i>Ardea alba</i>) were evaluated. All five animals presented with neurological signs of limb paralysis, dyspnea, and neck flaccidity and were unable to fly. After clinical evaluation, the animals were euthanized, and necropsies were performed. Although we observed discrete hemorrhagic enteritis in the three evaluated ducks, no other relevant lesions were found. Samples were sent to the laboratory, where type <i>C botulinum</i> toxin was detected. The presence of botulism in urban areas, especially in leisure areas, raises public health concerns. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of type C botulism in a public urban park in São Paulo, Brazil. Although this toxin does not pose a direct risk to human health, it is a strong indicator of environmental health, affecting wild free-ranging birds.",Open veterinary journal,2025,Márcio Junio Lima Siconelli; Jéssica Caroline De Almeida Dias; Sofia De Moura Lacerda Sarantopoulos; Benedito Antonio Lopes Da Fonseca; Karin Werther; Simone Miyashiro
40557085,First detection of West Nile virus seropositivity in horses in southern Iraq.,"West Nile virus (WNV) circulates between birds and mosquitoes, with horses and humans as incidental dead-end hosts. Despite documented cases in neighboring countries and human cases in southern Iraq, no previous studies have investigated WNV in Iraqi horses. To determine the seroprevalence of WNV in horses from three southern Iraqi governorates (Thi-Qar, Misan, and Basrah) between March and June 2024. Blood samples were collected from 236 horses regardless of age, sex, or health status. Serum samples were analyzed using commercial competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits to detect specific anti-Pr E IgG and IgM antibodies. The overall IgG seropositivity rate was 30.08%, with similar rates reported for Misan (30.66%), Basrah (30.12%), and Thi-Qar (29.48%). IgM seropositivity was 11.86% overall, with 14.67%, 7.22%, and 14.1% in Misan, Basrah, and Thi-Qar, respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed among governorates (<i>p</i> > 0.05). Females had a slightly increased positivity rate (42.7%) when placed alongside males (38%), and with respect to age, the positivity rates for three distinct age categories: 1 to 2 years (no.64), 2 to 5 years (no.135), and above 5 years (no.37) were recorded as 45.31%, 41.48%, and 37.83%, respectively. This is the first study to demonstrate WNV seropositivity in Iraqi horses, revealing active virus circulation in southern Iraq, particularly in marshland areas suitable for mosquito vectors and migratory birds. The findings highlight the need for surveillance programs and preventive measures to control WNV transmission throughout the region.",Open veterinary journal,2025,Hayder Mohammad Al-Rammahi; Rahman Kadhum Mohsen; Rasha Monther Othman
40557036,Emotional stress during the COVID-19 lockdown: how negative X/Twitter posts correlated with changes in the brain's fear network.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected mental health, with lockdown periods particularly exacerbating negative emotions such as fear, sadness, and uncertainty. This study examines brain metabolic changes associated with the psychological context of the first French COVID-19 lockdown in vulnerable individuals. As a proxy measure of the psychological context, we used a composite negative-emotion score derived from an open-source X/Twitter dataset (""The First French COVID-19 Lockdown Twitter Dataset""), designed to capture public sentiment over the 55-day lockdown. This score was day-by-day correlated with whole-brain voxel-based [18F]FDG PET imaging in 95 patients with neurological conditions, using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) (<i>p</i>-voxel < 0.001, <i>k</i> > 108). A significant negative correlation was found between daily negative-emotion scores and metabolism in the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), key regions of the brain's fear circuit. Inter-regional correlation analysis (IRCA) of metabolic connectivity from the right vmPFC/ACC further revealed a right limbic-dominant network including the amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, and basal ganglia. These findings highlight the sensitivity of the right vmPFC/ACC to societal emotional stressors, suggesting a potential cerebral substrate for the increase in psychological and psychiatric disorders observed during the pandemic. Further research is needed to validate these results in larger populations and to explore their longitudinal implications, to better understand the neurological impact of collective stress.",Frontiers in nuclear medicine,2025,Eric Guedj; Jacques-Yves Campion; Tatiana Horowitz; Fanny Barthélémy; Stéphanie Khalfa; Wissam El-Hage
40557025,"Unmasking Pulmonary Nocardiosis in an Asthmatic Host Presenting With Chronic Cough, Pulmonary Nodularity, and Ground-Glass Opacities.","A 53-year-old man was evaluated in the pulmonary clinic for ongoing asthma symptoms. Despite optimized treatment, he continued to experience a chronic productive cough. He was otherwise physically active, a lifelong non-smoker with no known occupational or environmental exposures. Pulmonary function tests demonstrated normal diffusing capacity and mild airflow obstruction. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed basilar bronchiectasis, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, scattered nodules, and progressive ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in the bilateral lower lobes. Immunoglobulin (Ig) testing showed an isolated IgG3 deficiency, while other Ig subclasses were within normal limits. Additional laboratory workup, including alpha-1 antitrypsin levels, antinuclear antibody, and HIV serologies, was unremarkable. Bronchoscopy was performed, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures grew pan-sensitive <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, prompting a course of levofloxacin. Despite an initial negative acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain, cultures later identified <i>Nocardia nova</i>. Given this diagnosis, a head CT was obtained to assess for central nervous system involvement, which was negative. The patient was initially started on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole but developed an adverse reaction, necessitating a switch to an extended course of intravenous ceftriaxone, which was later changed to clarithromycin based on susceptibility testing. A repeat chest CT demonstrated resolution of nodularity, GGOs, and lymphadenopathy. His symptoms fully resolved, with no recurrence of cough or asthma-like exacerbations. Although <i>Nocardia</i> infections are commonly associated with immunosuppression, typically occurring in patients with solid organ or hematopoietic cell transplants, chronic glucocorticoid use, malignancy, or HIV with low CD4 counts, approximately one-third of cases are reported in immunocompetent individuals. While cellular immunocompromise is a well-established risk factor, isolated IgG3 deficiency is not. Asthma, particularly when treated with corticosteroids or accompanied by structural lung disease, is also recognized as a key predisposing respiratory condition. Pulmonary involvement is most frequent, though dissemination to the central nervous system and skin can also occur. This case underscores the need to consider pulmonary nocardiosis even in patients without an overtly immunocompromised state who present with unexplained respiratory symptoms. Diagnosis requires a high index of clinical suspicion and may necessitate bronchoscopy or other invasive procedures when initial treatments fail. Prompt identification and targeted antimicrobial therapy are essential for a favorable outcome.",Cureus,2025,Marie Yung-Chen Wu; Thomas C Tsai; Chih-Heng Hsieh; Felipe Barbosa; Aba Somers
40557018,Understanding the Association Between Mental Health and Hair Loss.,"This literature review aims to analyze the association between mental health disorders and various types of hair loss, including telogen effluvium, androgenetic alopecia, alopecia areata, and compulsive disorders such as trichotillomania. A comprehensive review of recent studies was conducted to explore the bidirectional relationship between psychiatric conditions and hair loss, with emphasis on neurobiological mechanisms and psychosocial consequences. Findings show that psychiatric disorders can contribute to or exacerbate hair loss, while hair loss may lead to psychological symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and body dysmorphic disorder. Proposed mechanisms include immune dysfunction, neuroendocrine imbalance, microinflammation, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) depletion, gut-brain-skin axis dysregulation, and medication-induced disruptions in hair cycling. Furthermore, individuals with somatic symptom disorder may report hair loss in the absence of clinical findings, complicating diagnosis and care. This review concludes that an interdisciplinary treatment model integrating dermatological and psychiatric support is essential for accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and overall patient well-being.",Cureus,2025,Mauri Malta; German Corso
40557002,Association Between Sleep-Related Leg Movements and Diabetes Prevalence: A Cohort Study From the United States.,"Background Sleep is integral to cardiometabolic health. While there is emerging evidence linking sleep-related leg movements (SRLM) to diabetes mellitus (DM), the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigates the association between SRLM and DM prevalence in a national population-based cohort study in the United States (US), considering potential mediators like short sleep duration and inflammation and examining variations across age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Methods We analyzed data from 9,191 adults (aged ≥18 years) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2008. We assessed the frequency of SRLM (leg jerks and leg cramps) and diabetes prevalence (self-reported diagnosis, diabetes medication use, or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 6.5%). Weighted logistic regression models were used to evaluate the associations, adjusting for demographic and clinical-related confounders. Mediation analyses were conducted to explore the roles of short sleep duration and inflammation (C-reactive protein levels). Results The study revealed that 1,278 (14%) participants have DM. SRLM was associated with a 72% increase in the odds of diabetes (OR=1.72, 95% CI: 1.06-2.81). The association is more pronounced in non-Hispanic White individuals, females, and adults aged 18-65. Short sleep duration and inflammation mediated 5.0% and 3.9% of this association, respectively. Conclusions SRLM is independently and linearly associated with increased prevalence of diabetes in a representative sample of the US adult population. Short sleep duration and inflammation mediated a small part of this association. Confirming the association in other samples and further investigation into its mechanisms are warranted to better understand the roles of the SRLM in the risk of diabetes.",Cureus,2025,Qinglan Ding; Yuting Xie; Brian B Koo; Zachary Hass; Brian Wojeck; Jason J Sico; Laura E Murray-Kolb; Dawn M Bravata; Andrey Zinchuk
40556955,Body Pain and Depressive Symptoms: Patterns and Associations in Middle-Aged and Older Chinese Adults.,"<b>Background:</b> Depressive symptoms (DS) and body pain are prevalent conditions that significantly impact the quality of life of older adults, often co-occurring with chronic diseases. This study aimed to explore the patterns of body pain characteristics and their association with DS among middle-aged and older Chinese adults. <b>Methods:</b> This cross-sectional study analysed data from 16,039 participants aged ≥45 years in the 2020 wave of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). DS were assessed using the 10-item Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10). Body pain characteristics included pain severity and location. Multiple linear regression and mediation analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between chronic diseases, body pain, and DS. <b>Results:</b> Among participants, 5442 (33.9%) reported DS (CESD-10 score ≥12). The DS group showed significantly higher body pain severity (2.66 ± 1.42 vs. 1.84 ± 1.11, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and more painful body parts (5.06 ± 3.87 vs. 3.68 ± 3.03, <i>p</i> < 0.001) compared to the non-depressive group. Both pain severity and number of pain sites were independently associated with higher CESD-10 scores. Mediation analysis revealed that body pain severity mediated 29.0% of the total effect between chronic diseases and DS. <b>Conclusion:</b> Body pain plays a significant mediating role in the relationship between chronic diseases and DS among middle-aged and older Chinese adults. These findings emphasize the importance of implementing comprehensive healthcare approaches that integrate pain management with mental health support in primary care settings.",Depression and anxiety,2025,Xiaohui Wu; Ruyan Huang; Yue Fei; Rongrong Zhong; Shuo Wang; Xiaojia Huang; Zuowei Wang; Yuncheng Zhu; Yiru Fang
40556954,Activation Likelihood Estimation Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy on Brain Activation in the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety Disorders.,"<b>Background:</b> Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) stands as a highly efficacious psychological treatment for both anxiety and depressive disorders. Nonetheless, scholarly debates persist regarding the specificities of brain area activation during CBT treatment for these disorders. <b>Methodology:</b> Utilizing activation likelihood estimation (ALE) analysis, this study aims to discern the neurobiological similarities and disparities between CBT's effects on anxiety and depressive disorders by examining functional brain areas. <b>Results:</b> A total of 22 articles, encompassing 443 patients, were included in the meta-analysis. Our results show that in the resting state, patients with depression treated with CBT resulted in increased activation of the right and left ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), left parahippocampal gyrus (PG), right subgyral, left inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), and right inferior occipital gyrus (IOG), whereas patients with anxiety disorders had increased activation of the right and left superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and decreased activation of the caudate after treatment. In the task state, increased activation of the right PG, right orbital frontal lobe, and right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) was mainly observed after treatment in patients with anxiety disorders, and the left lentiform nucleus (LN), left dorsal entorhinal cortex, and right caudate activation were decreased. For depressive disorders, no consistent activation patterns emerged in the task state, likely due to limited studies or heterogeneity in task paradigms across included studies. <b>Conclusion:</b> CBT's efficacy relies on both shared (e.g., vACC-mediated emotion regulation and cognitive control) and distinct neural mechanisms (fear-circuit modulation in anxiety vs. memory-network enhancement in depression), informing biomarker-driven treatment personalization.",Depression and anxiety,2025,Junjie Ren; Lijun Ma; Wanxin Wu; Juan Qiu; Zhuo Zhang; Yuxi Hong; Zushen Wang; Xinyu Hou; Jia Jin; Weixuan Hu; Yanran Wu; Xiaowei Chen; Jinyi Luo; Chuan Fan; Kai Wang; Xiaoming Li
40556907,Association between household solid fuel use and dual sensory impairment in a Chinese population: a retrospective cohort study.,"Dual sensory impairment (DSI) is more harmful than a single visual impairment or hearing impairment. We aimed to explore the relationship between household fuel use and the risk of DSI in the middle-aged and older adult Chinese population. Data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) 2015 of 8,083 participants aged ≥45 years were used, followed up to 2018. Household fuels include heating fuels and cooking fuels. Participants were divided into four groups based on the type of household fuel use at baseline (2015) and during follow-up (2018) (baseline and follow-up): clean fuels and clean fuels, clean fuels and solid fuels, solid fuels and clean fuels, and solid fuels and solid fuels. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association between household fuel use and the risk of DSI, and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was utilized to evaluate the association. Of these 8,083 participants, 886 (10.96%) had hearing impairment, 2,361 (29.21%) had visual impairment, and 505 (6.25%) had DSI. The use of solid fuels at baseline (OR = 1.23, 95%CI: 1.02-1.49) was associated with a higher risk of DSI compared to the use of clean fuels. People in the clean fuels and solid fuels group (OR = 1.50, 95%CI: 1.04-2.16) and the solid fuels and solid fuels group (OR = 1.38, 95%CI: 1.10-1.73) were linked to an increased risk of DSI compared to people in the clean fuels and clean fuels group, whereas no significant difference was observed in the effect on DSI between people in the solid fuels and clean fuels group and the clean fuels and clean fuels group (<i>p</i> = 0.99). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that males in the solid fuels and clean fuels group (OR = 0.60, 95%CI: 0.39-0.92) had a lower risk of DSI compared to those in the solid fuels and solid fuels group. Household solid fuel use is associated with an increased risk of DSI in middle-aged and older Chinese people, and promoting the use of clean fuels is beneficial in reducing the burden of DSI.",Frontiers in public health,2025,Yaolei Du; Mengnan Wu; Mansha He
40556905,Prevalence and antibiotic resistance of pathogens isolated from neurosurgical patients with postoperative central nervous system infections in a tertiary hospital in North China.,"Postoperative central nervous system infection (PCNSI) is a serious complication following neurosurgery. Effective clinical management of PCNSI requires prompt antibiotic administration based on the identification of the causative pathogens and antibiotic resistance. This study aimed to investigate the causative pathogens of PCNSI and their antibiotic resistance profiles, which could help clinicians initiate appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy. The distribution and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens in patients with PCNSI from January 2014 to December 2023 were analyzed retrospectively. Cerebrospinal fluid samples were aseptically collected and subjected to standard microbiological methods for bacterial isolation and identification. Antibiotic sensitivity testing was performed via the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion agar method. A total of 396 patients were diagnosed with PCNSI, and 385 pathogens were identified from these patients. The percentages of Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi were 56.10, 41.30, and 2.60%, respectively. The predominant pathogens among the Gram-positive bacteria were coagulase-negative staphylococci (29.09%), whereas <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (14.29%) was the most common Gram-negative bacterium. Compared with those from 2014 to 2018, the proportions of <i>Enterococcus</i> and <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> increased markedly from 2019 to 2023. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that all Gram-positive bacteria had 100% sensitivity to vancomycin and linezolid, whereas imipenem, meropenem, and amikacin were most effective against Gram-negative bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria, especially coagulase-negative staphylococci, were the predominant pathogens causing PCNSI. Furthermore, several Gram-negative species, especially <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> and <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, showed concerning trends of increasing resistance to common antibiotics. <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> showed an increasing proportion of infections, posing a clinical challenge due to the limited number of effective antibiotics.",Frontiers in public health,2025,Fan Yang; Jingnan Chen; Mengjie Zhao; Hejun Zhao; Bin Yang; Xuequan Feng
40556904,"The current status, trends, and challenges of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias in Asia (1990-2036).","With global aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias have emerged as significant health threats to the older adults, garnering considerable attention due to their impact on public health. Despite the substantial burden of dementia in Asia, targeted research remains limited. This study aims to assess the current burden, future trends, risk factors, and inequalities in Asia. The GBD 2021 study was utilized to evaluate the numbers and age-standardized rates (ASRs) of prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of AD and other dementias from 1990 to 2021. Joinpoint regression analysis was performed to assess the trends during this period, while the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was employed to predict future trends. Additionally, the relationship between disease burden and sociodemographic index (SDI) was also analyzed. In 2021, Asia experienced a 250.44% increase in prevalent cases, a 297.34% rise in mortality, and a 249.54% surge in DALYs for AD and other dementias compared to 1990. Meanwhile, the age-standardized prevalence rate, age-standardized mortality rate, and age-standardized DALY rate also exhibited varying degrees of rise from 1990 to 2021. Demographically, the disease burden was higher in women and those aged 65 and above. Regionally, the burden was highest in East Asia and relatively low in South and Central Asia. Nationally, China, India, Japan, and Indonesia reported the most cases. Over the next 15 years, the age-standardized prevalence rate in Asia is expected to peak in 2028 before declining, while the age-standardized mortality rate is anticipated to keep rising. An overall ""V"" shaped association was found between sociodemographic index (SDI) and the age-standardized DALY rate in Asia. Only smoking, high fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and high BMI were identified as causal risk factors within the GBD framework. The burden of AD and other dementias in Asia has significantly increased over the past three decades and is expected to persistently impact Asian populations, particularly in developing countries experiencing rapid demographic shifts. Women and the older adult should be a focus of attention. It is imperative to implement targeted prevention and intervention strategies, enhance chronic disease management, and control risk factors.",Frontiers in public health,2025,Ziyang He; Haoqin Zhang; Guishan Hu; Yinan Qiao; Can Yin; Jianqiao Li; Hong Lin; Anguo Wu; Dalian Qin; Betty Yuen-Kwan Law; Guangqiang Hu; Lu Yu
40556901,"A pilot short-term study of feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of 3-stage 8-session 4-week group therapy-based narrative intervention in 17 improved hospitalized female schizophrenia patients in southern China.","Self-stigma has been consistently cited as a major obstacle to recovery-related outcomes among patients with schizophrenia. To examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the group-based narrative intervention for improving self-stigma, self-esteem and psychological capital in hospitalized patients with schizophrenia, a case-series study was conducted from March to May 2023 in a closed psychiatric ward of a specialized hospital in mainland China. Feasibility was assessed by examining rates of recruitment, retention, and protocol adherence. Acceptability was assessed through the therapist's and patients' feedback about the intervention. Changes in the levels of self-stigma, self-esteem, and psychological capital perceived by patients were measured before and after 4 weeks of intervention. Rates of enrolment (85%) and completion of intervention sessions and study procedures (100%) were excellent, demonstrating high rates of feasibility among these patients in the local setting. The feedback from participants and the therapist about satisfaction, helpfulness, and difficulty of the intervention was largely positive, demonstrating high rates of acceptability. And the results indicated significant improvements in patients' self-reported self-stigma, self-esteem, and psychological capital (change in <i>T</i> = 3.872, <i>p</i> = 0.001; <i>T</i> = -6.308, <i>p</i> < 0.001; <i>T</i> = -2.895, <i>p</i> = 0.011, respectively).

40556825,Evaluating the antioxidant-mediated neuroprotection of hamamelitannin against H₂O₂-induced oxidative damage.,"Excessive generation of free radicals disrupts redox equilibrium, inducing oxidative stress. Dementia and other related neurodegenerative illnesses are important ailments associated with oxidative stress. Antioxidant treatment proves effective in reducing oxidative stress and associated neurodegeneration. This study examined the therapeutic potential of Hamamelitannin, a hydrolyzable tannin derived from the barks of <i>Hamamelis virginiana</i> L., against the hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress. Hamamelitannin (10-50 μM) had no effects on the hatching, heart rates, and also no lethal malformations were observed. Hammamelitannin exposure significantly (p < 0.05) improved the alterations in swimming behavior and the cognitive impairment caused by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in a concentration-dependent manner from 10 to 50 μM. It also showed significant restoration of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GPx, GST, and GSH), and acetylcholinesterase activity was observed in larvae exposed to hydrogen peroxide compared to the control. Hamamelitannin lowered the MDA and nitric oxide levels in group treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The Cell death and intracellular ROS levels were assessed using acridine orange and dichlorofluorescein diacetate staining methods. Hamamelitannin significantly (p < 0.05) reduced apoptosis and ROS levels caused by hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, Hamamelitannin upregulated the expression of antioxidant enzyme genes, indicating its potential in combating oxidative stress. These findings suggest that Hamamelitannin has substantial therapeutic value against neurological disorders associated with ROS accumulation.",3 Biotech,2025,Vishnu Adith Janarthanam; Rupesh Gupta; Alaa S Alhegaili; Ajay Guru; Praveen Kumar Issac
40556824,Exploring the spectrum of heroin-induced changes in the rat brain.,"The primary objective of this study was to investigate the effects of prolonged heroin exposure on adult male rats. Our findings demonstrate that this intervention induces deficits in memory, synaptic plasticity, emotional regulation, and motor function. These impairments appear to be associated with reduced levels of BDNF, increased expression of REST/NRSF, and elevated astrocyte activity within the hippocampus. We employed a multimodal approach to assess the impact of heroin in 24 adult male rats following 2 weeks of daily injections. Behavioral assessments were conducted to evaluate memory and anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors, followed by tests of neuromuscular and locomotor function. Molecular and histological analyses were subsequently performed to characterize heroin-induced alterations in the brain. Heroin-treated rats showed impaired performance in cognitive tasks, evidenced by reduced scores in the Y-maze and shuttle box tests. Furthermore, heroin exposure negatively affected behavioral scores in the open field test, tail suspension test, and elevated plus maze. Electromyography (EMG) revealed increased latency, indicating disruptions in neuromuscular activity. Indicators of long-term potentiation (LTP), including population spike amplitude, and field EPSP slope, were significantly reduced following heroin administration. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed marked astrogliosis and alterations in BDNF and REST expression in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Additionally, heroin disrupted the spatial organization of neurons. In conclusion, these results suggest that heroin exposure induces structural and functional neuronal changes, likely mediated by neuroinflammation and dysregulated neurotrophic signaling, which may underlie the observed cognitive impairments.",3 Biotech,2025,Proushat Shirvani; Paniz Shirvani; Seyed Mohammadmisagh Moteshakereh; Zahrasadat Lajevardi; Seyedeh Naghmeh Nourirad; Nahal Babaeian Amini; Zahra Niakan; Siavash Parvardeh; Amir-Hossein Bayat; Ramtin Hajibeygi; Kimia Vakili; Fetemeh Navaei; Mohammad Mahdi Mehrabi; Sina Dolatshahi; Hossein Salehi Omran; Mojtaba Sani; Meysam Hassani Moghaddam; Abbas Aliaghaei
40556758,The role of the tryptophan metabolites in gut microbiota-brain axis and potential treatments: a focus on ischemic stroke.,"Gut microbiota disturbances can elevate the risk of stroke by contributing to cerebrovascular events. Particularly, the gut tryptophan (TRP) metabolite is an essential mediator of the gut-brain axis. This review highlights the role of TRP metabolism in stroke, the influence of intestinal microbiomes on stroke pathology via TRP metabolism, and the gut-brain axis interactions. Recent studies indicate that various bioactive molecules produced via TRP metabolism can regulate various neurological functions and interrupt stroke pathophysiology. Moreover, the relationship between gut TRP metabolism and stroke development has been verified. TRP metabolism involves three pathways: kynurenine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and indole, which potentially regulate post-stroke, may function as aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonists to modify neuronal excitotoxicity, and offer crucial targets for stroke treatment. This suggests that modulating TRP metabolite levels through various methods can enhance the prognosis of central nervous system diseases and restore microbiota-gut-brain axis functions.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2025,Na Qin; Xiaodi Xie; Rong Deng; Shiman Gao; Ting Zhu
40556745,Human Muscle-Derived Vascular Stem Cells Can Support Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells In Vitro.,"<b>Background:</b> The normal hematopoiesis of the body depends on the interaction between hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that support the growth and development of hematopoietic cells. However, the separation of MSCs from bone marrow is somewhat limited, and the researchers have turned their attention to stromal cells outside the bone marrow. As the largest organ of human body, skeletal muscle tissue stores a variety of muscle-derived vascular stem/progenitor cells, including muscle-derived pericytes/perivascular cells (MD-PCs) and skeletal muscle derived myoendothelial cells (MECs). Studies have shown that MD-PCs and MECs are similar to bone morrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs), which express the surface markers of MSCs and have the potential of multidirectional differentiation. However, very few researches have been done on whether MD-PCs and MECs, like MSCs, can support HSPCs expansion/proliferation, differentiation and possible hematopoietic regulation mechanisms, so the hematopoietic support of these cells remains to be studied. <b>Objective:</b> To identify the biological characteristics of CD146<sup>+</sup> PCs and MECs isolated from human skeletal muscle and to study their supporting effect on umbilical cord blood (UCB) CD34<sup>+</sup> cells in vitro. <b>Methods:</b> Human skeletal muscle-derived CD146<sup>+</sup> PCs and MECs were isolated and purified by multiparameter flow cytometry and their biological characteristics were identified. The coculture system for CD34<sup>+</sup> cells with CD146<sup>+</sup> PCs and MECs as trophoblastic layer, and BM-MSCs as positive control, was established in vitro, respectively. The main outcome measures, including the number and immunophenotype of the cells, the colony formation ability, the expression levels of cytokines were analyzed and compared at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after coculture. <b>Results:</b> CD146<sup>+</sup> PCs and MECs were isolated by multiparameter flow cytometry and their purity of was 92.55% ± 0.55% and 96.60% ± 1.14% (<i>n</i> = 18), respectively. Both of the cells could be differentiated into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and myocytes. Compared with the positive control group of BM-MSCs, the experimental group of CD146<sup>+</sup> PCs and MECs showed no significant differences in cell number, colony formation ability and immunophenotype (CD45<sup>+</sup>, CD34<sup>+</sup> CD33<sup>-</sup>, CD14<sup>+</sup>, and CD10<sup>+</sup>/CD19<sup>+</sup>; <i>p</i>  > 0.05, <i>n</i> = 5), separately. The expression levels of cytokines in the culture supernatants of CD146<sup>+</sup> PCs group, MECs group, and BM-MSCs group were measured by ELISA. The expression levels of TPO, IFN-γ, HGF, MCSF, and SCF cytokines were different among CD146<sup>+</sup> PCs, MECs, and human BM-MSCs (<i>p</i> < 0.05, <i>n</i> = 3). Due to the no nourishing feeder layer in culture system, the number of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells decreased significantly in the 1st week and no cells survived in the 2nd week. Therefore, the cell immunophenotype and colony analysis and the expression levels of cytokines could not be performed. <b>Conclusion:</b> In summary, CD146<sup>+</sup> PCs and MECs from human skeletal muscle, like human BM-MSCs, have hematopoietic support capacity in vitro.",Stem cells international,2025,Tingting Yang; Jie Ma; Siqi Zhang; Rui Zhou; Xiaoping Yang; Bo Zheng
40556715,Feasibility and acceptability of community-based psychosocial interventions delivered by nonspecialists for perinatal common mental disorders: A systematic review using an implementation science framework.,"Task sharing is endorsed as one of the strategies to address the treatment gap in common perinatal mental health conditions. There is a well-established body of evidence on the effectiveness of psychological interventions delivered by nonspecialist health workers (NSHWs); however, there is a dearth of evidence documenting factors determining the feasibility, acceptability and sustainability of integrating and implementing these interventions. This systematic review aims to synthesize the implementation outcomes and implementation process of NSHWs-delivered psychological interventions for the management of perinatal depression and anxiety using Proctor's implementation science framework outlining eight constructs: feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, adoption, cost, fidelity, penetration and sustainability. We searched PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Center Register of Controlled Trials for studies published in English and between 2000 and 2022 using search terms under five broad categories: (a) ""perinatal""; (b) ""common mental disorders""; (c) ""psychological interventions""; (d) ""nonspecialist"" and (e) ""implementation outcomes."" Secondary publications were also hand-searched for data extraction. Two authors independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles. Data for included articles were extracted using a standard data extraction sheet. A narrative synthesis of qualitative evidence was conducted. Initial searches identified 885 articles of which full text of 128 articles were screened for eligibility, with 56 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Out of the eight constructs of Proctor's framework, ""feasibility,"" ""acceptability,"" ""appropriateness"" and ""fidelity"" were the most evaluated outcomes. None of the studies reported ""penetration"" and very few reported ""sustainability,"" ""adoption"" or ""cost."" None of the studies used any implementation science framework for the study evaluation. Despite the well-established evidence on the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for perinatal depression and anxiety by NSHWs, these interventions are rarely adopted into the health system. More studies applying systems thinking are needed to explore facilitators, barriers and mechanisms for integrating interventions in the health system. Using implementation science frameworks to design, plan, execute and evaluate psychosocial interventions by NSHWs can address this gap in evidence.","Global mental health (Cambridge, England)",2025,Prasansa Subba; Pragya Shrestha; Atif Rahman; Nagendra Luitel; Ahmed Waqas; Siham Sikander
40556661,A splice-switching antisense oligonucleotide targeting APP reduces accumulation of α-synuclein in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by abnormal protein aggregation, with amyloid beta (Aβ) and α-synuclein (α-syn) as key pathological markers. Increasing evidence highlights a pathological interplay between Aβ and α-syn, exacerbating neurodegeneration in both AD and PD. In this study, we evaluated the effects of reducing amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing on α-syn pathology using a splice-switching oligonucleotide (SSO) targeting APP exon 15 in Thy1-α-syn transgenic (α-syn-tg) mice. α-syn-tg mice received systemic APP SSO treatment. Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting assessed α-syn, phosphorylated α-syn (P-Syn), and APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) in the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus. Neuronal integrity in different brain regions were examined, and behavioral assessments evaluated cognitive and motor functions. APP SSO treatment significantly reduced α-syn and P-Syn in the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus while also reversing neuronal loss in the hippocampal CA3 region. Interestingly, α-syn-tg mice exhibited elevated levels of alternative APP CTFs, which were reduced by APP SSO treatment, implicating APP processing dysregulation in α-syn pathology. Although behavioral assessments revealed no significant impairments or improvements in female α-syn-tg mice. Our findings demonstrate that targeting APP reduces α-syn pathology and rescues neuronal loss, supporting the therapeutic potential of APP modulation in synucleinopathies. While no behavioral changes were observed in transgenic mice, further research exploring different models and conditions may provide additional insights into the full range of therapeutic benefits. Future studies should optimize delivery methods and explore combination therapies to enhance outcomes in neurodegenerative diseases with overlapping proteinopathies. APP-targeting SSO reduces α-syn and P-Syn in α-syn-tg mice.APP SSO lowers APP CTFs, linking APP processing to α-syn pathology.Neuronal loss in the hippocampal CA3 region is restored following APP SSO treatment.Behavioral assessments show no significant changes in female α-syn-tg mice.Findings support APP modulation as a potential strategy for synucleinopathies.","Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N.

40556615,Protein Associations With Alcohol Consumption and Genetic Risk for Alcohol-Related Sociomedical Conditions.,"Studies investigating proteomic associations with alcohol consumption and the genetic links of these proteins to alcohol-related traits are scarce. The aims of our study were (1) to identify proteins associated with alcohol consumption and (2) to investigate the molecular pathways and genetics linking the identified proteins to alcohol consumption and related sociomedical conditions. We generated proteomic and genotypic data from blood samples of 387 Finnish twins (age range: 56-70) and calculated polygenic risk scores (PRSs) of eight alcohol-related traits: obesity, alcohol dependence, number of drinks per week, number of cigarettes per day, major depressive disorders (MDDs), schizophrenia, externalising behaviour and educational attainment. We identified 20 (out of 2321) proteins associated with alcohol consumption, expressed as log ethanol grams per month, after Bonferroni correction and adjustment for BMI, sex and age. Within-pair analyses in monozygotic twin pairs showed that some of the identified associations persisted after accounting for genetic confounding. While only the PRS representing genetic risk for the number of alcoholic drinks per week was associated with alcohol consumption, several proteins were associated with PRSs, in particular the PRS of MDD. All identified proteins were significantly replicated in the UK Biobank, and pathway analysis suggested their collective connection to alcohol consumption might be explained by oxidative stress and cell damage. In conclusion, we identified several alcohol-associated plasma proteins whose levels are also linked to genetic risk for mental illness and substance use. Our study suggests the potential of proteins as biomarkers for early detection of alcohol-related disorders.",Addiction biology,2025,Gabin Drouard; Teemu Palviainen; Chia-Ling Kuo; Breno S Diniz; Xiaoling Wang; Miina Ollikainen; Antti Latvala; Jaakko Kaprio
40556544,Saturated Fatty Acids and White Matter Microstructure in Individuals With At-risk Mental State.,"Excessive saturated or deficient unsaturated fatty acids and white matter microstructural abnormalities are observed before the psychosis onset. Whereas fatty acids variations are implicated in white matter pathology, conventional Diffusion Tensor Imaging has limitations in disentangling their biological relevance. Free-water imaging provides improved biological specificity to white matter microstructure, such as fractional volume of free-water (FW) and tissue-specific fractional anisotropy (FAt). This study aims to investigate the associations between altered proportion of saturated or unsaturated fatty acids and free-water imaging parameters in prodromal psychosis. We applied free-water imaging and Tract-Based Spatial Statistics to compare FAt and FW between 78 individuals with at-risk mental state (ARMS) and 129 healthy controls. In a subsample with available blood samples (n = 53 and n = 42, respectively), relationships between fatty acid composition of erythrocyte membrane and FAt or FW were examined alongside clinical and cognitive variables. Compared to the controls, individuals with ARMS exhibited higher relative concentrations of saturated fatty acids as well as lower FAt and higher FW in multiple association and projection fibers. In the ARMS group, elevated proportion of saturated fatty acids was associated with lower FAt and with positive symptoms and impaired verbal fluency. The association of saturated fatty acids with FAt in ARMS suggests that fatty acids may influence disrupted white matter microstructure, such as impaired myelin maintenance prior to psychosis onset. Future studies should explore early interventions to mitigate white matter cellular deterioration by optimizing saturated fatty acid levels.",Schizophrenia bulletin,2025,Daiki Sasabayashi; Hiroko Itoh; Kiyotaka Nemoto; Yuko Higuchi; Yukiko Akasaki; Alana Wickham; Kang Ik K Cho; Ofer Pasternak; Dheshan Mohandass; Ryan Zurrin; Tashrif Billah; Suheyla Cetin-Karayumak; Haruko Kobayashi; Kazumi Sakamoto; Yoichiro Takayanagi; Noa Tsujii; Shinsuke Koike; Yoji Hirano; Kyo Noguchi; Tomiki Sumiyoshi; Michio Suzuki; Tsutomu Takahashi; Marek Kubicki
40556526,Evaluation of the effects of tideglusib and calcium sulfate on the healing of experimental bone defects in rabbits.,"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of tideglusib and bone graft mixture on bone healing. Tideglusib is a drug used in the treatment of various neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. In a relevant study, the positive effect of tideglusib on the Wnt pathway, one of the pathways involved in bone regeneration and dentin tissue regeneration, was demonstrated. Dentin and bone tissues have structurally similar healing mechanisms. Therefore, tideglusib may have a similar effect on the bone tissue. The main goal of bone grafting is to provide bone regeneration and functional healing through remodeling. Bone graft materials are divided into four types based on their source: autogenous, allogenous, xenogenous, and alloplastic. Because these graft materials have various advantages and disadvantages, research continues to focus on alternative materials and applications. Sixteen New Zealand rabbits were included in this study. A unicortical 3.5 mm diameter defect was created in the tibia of rabbits under general anesthesia. The groups in the study were as follows: Group 1, left proximal tibia defect area was controlled (defect area was left empty); Group 2, left distal tibia defect area was treated with tideglusib + calcium sulfate; Group 3, right proximal tibia defect area was treated with calcium sulfate only; Group 4, right distal tibia defect area was treated with tideglusib only. Mediolateral (M/L) radiographs of the tibia were taken on the 30th and 60th postoperative days. On the 30th day, the first eight rabbits were sacrificed, and on the 60th day, the remaining eight were sacrificed for histopathological examination. New bone formation in the obtained samples was evaluated by radiological and histopathological analyses. The study concluded that the combination of tideglusib and calcium sulfate significantly enhanced bone healing compared with the other groups (p<0.005). This suggests that tideglusib, either alone or in combination with bone graft materials, could serve as a promising alternative for the repair of bone defects.",Polish journal of veterinary sciences,2025,K Yener; A Hayat
40556494,Structural Alterations Associated With Cardiovascular Autonomic Failure in Multiple System Atrophy.,"Early severe autonomic failure (AF) in multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a risk factor for poor survival. Postmortem studies suggested that AF is related to the degeneration of preganglionic autonomic neurons of the brainstem and spinal cord. Characterize cerebral alterations on brain imaging associated with cardiovascular AF. Cardiovascular sympathetic failure was evaluated through orthostatic hypotension (OH) based on changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure during tilt-test (ΔSBP and ΔDBP). Reduced heart rate (HR) variability reflecting cardio-vagal impairment was assessed with a composite score formed by the root-mean square differences of successive R-R intervals (RMSSD) and HR changes during deep breathing. Voxel-based morphometry (SPM12), volumetry, and cortical thickness measurements (FreeSurfer 7.0) of T1-weighted anatomical images were used to assess gray matter (GM) atrophy in sub-tentorial structures. Multivariate analysis included age, disease severity (UMSARS), and total intracranial volume as confounding factors. A total of 62 MSA patients followed at the French Reference Center were retrospectively included, aged 67.3 ± 8.6 years, 69.4% MSA-P, disease duration 4.2 ± 2.1 years. Medulla atrophy was correlated to OH (p < 0.006). Decrease in GM volume in the left anterior cerebellum (lobule V) was correlated to ΔDBP (pFWEc = 0.017). GM loss in the left interposed nucleus was correlated to ΔSBP (p < 0.003), whereas atrophy of the right dentate was associated with decreased HR variability (p < 0.003). Medulla volume was strongly correlated with OH.

40556475,"Validation of the ""Patient-Acceptable Symptom State"" Question as Outcome Measure in AChR Myasthenia Gravis: A Multicentre, Prospective Study.","Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) is emerging as a valuable subjective measure of the overall myasthenia gravis (MG)-related burden. This study aimed at identifying PASS-positive thresholds for the most used clinical scales, investigating whether PASS and MGFA post-intervention status capture different aspects of the disease outcome, and identifying clinical variables associated with PASS=YES response. Adult AChR-MG patients were prospectively enrolled at two Italian Centres (Rome: index cohort; Florence: validation cohort). PASS thresholds for MG-ADL, QMG, and MG-QOL15r were defined in the index cohort by ROC analysis and validated in the validation cohort; predictors of favorable PASS were identified by multivariable analysis. This study included 173 patients (44% females, median age at onset: 53 years). PASS=YES patients had significantly lower median MG-ADL, QMG, and MG-QOL15r scores, with the following thresholds for PASS=YES: MG ADL ≤ 2, QMG ≤ 8 and MG-QOL15r ≤ 6. The MG-ADL (OR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.36-0.60, p < 0.001), QMG (OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.64-0.81, p < 0.001) and MG-QOL15r (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.70-0.84, p < 0.001), were independently associated with a favorable PASS. The degree of ocular involvement in each scale was the strongest negative determinant of PASS=YES.

40556471,Video-Oculography as a Key Diagnostic Tool for SCA27B: A Real-Life Experience.,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 27B (SCA27B), caused by a GAA repeat expansion in FGF14, is a recently described genetic etiology of idiopathic late-onset cerebellar ataxia (ILOCA). Downbeat nystagmus (DBN) is increasingly recognized as a clinical hallmark of this condition. We aimed to assess the diagnostic value of video-oculography (VOG) in detecting SCA27B and its role in monitoring response to 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) in a real-world clinical setting. We retrospectively analyzed patients with ILOCA referred to Fondation Rothschild Hospital (Paris, France) from February 2023 to January 2024. All underwent clinical, MRI, and VOG assessments, with genetic testing for FGF14-GAA expansions. Clinical and oculomotor features of carriers (≥ 200 repeats) and non-carriers were compared. A subset of symptomatic carriers received 4-AP and were evaluated at baseline, 2 months, and 8 months using the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) and VOG. Twelve of 34 tested patients (35%) were FGF14-GAA expansion carriers. DBN was significantly more frequent in carriers than in non-carriers (92% vs. 33%, p = 0.003), often associated with gaze-evoked nystagmus (75% vs. 19%, p = 0.005). MRI did not distinguish carriers from non-carriers.

40556466,Objective adherence to oral appliance therapy in patients with obstructive sleep apnea: a one-year longitudinal analysis.,"Oral appliance (OA) therapy is widely used as an alternative to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for treating obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Traditionally, OA adherence has been assessed through subjective self-reports before, but the availability of objective adherence sensors now allows for more accurate monitoring. This study aimed to analyze one-year objective adherence data to identify adherence patterns over time and factors influencing adherence to OA therapy. Fifty-five OSA patients were recruited from a cohort study and underwent clinical follow-ups at baseline, 1, 6 and 12 months. Patients were treated with custom-made, titratable OAs, and adherence was objectively collected using embedded sensors. Adherence data were analyzed using both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) approaches. Statistical methods, including comparative analyses, logistic regression models, and multivariate linear regression were performed to identify predictors of adherence. Twenty-one patients dropped out before the 12-month follow-up, leaving 34 completed the entire study. At the 1-month follow-up, 80.0% of patients were classified as adherent, with a mean wearing time of 5.98 ± 2.38 hours per night. By 6 months, adherence decreased to 67.3%, with a mean wearing time of 5.69 ± 2.08 hours per night. Several significant predictors of adherence were identified, including larger baseline overjet, younger age, and marital status. OA adherence declined significantly within the first 6 months but stabilized between 6 and 12 months. Key baseline factors, such as larger overjet, younger age, and being married or partnered are predictors of better adherence, while psychological Comorbidities are associated with lower adherence.",European journal of orthodontics,2025,Yanlong Chen; Benjamin T Pliska; Bingshuang Zou; Fernanda R Almeida
40556454,Grip Strength as a Marker of Resting-State Network Integrity and Well-Being in Early Psychosis.,"Psychomotor function is a critical marker of risk and outcome of psychosis. Grip strength is one aspect of psychomotor function that is known to be linked to structural neural integrity and well-being. This study sought to determine whether grip strength is a marker of alterations in resting-state connectivity and well-being in psychotic disorders in order to further clarify the mechanisms by which psychosis phenomenology is related to psychomotor processes. The authors analyzed resting-state functional MRI and grip strength in 89 individuals with early psychosis and 51 control subjects without psychiatric disorders from the Human Connectome Project for Early Psychosis. Participants ranged in age from 16 to 35 years. Using multivariate pattern analysis of whole-connectome data, the authors identified brain correlates of grip strength and then replicated this analysis using the NIH Toolbox well-being measures and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF). The psychosis group exhibited reduced grip strength, well-being, and GAF scores compared to the control group. Grip strength was linked to resting-state connectivity in the sensorimotor cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and cerebellum. Connectivity correlated with the default mode network (DMN) (r<sub>sensorimotor</sub>=0.22, r<sub>cingulate</sub>=0.30, r<sub>cerebellum</sub>=0.24). When the analysis was repeated for GAF and well-being, overlapping regions in the sensorimotor cortex and cerebellum were connected to the DMN and related to GAF (r<sub>sensorimotor</sub>=0.17, r<sub>cerebellum</sub>=0.28) and well-being (r<sub>sensorimotor</sub>=0.16, r<sub>cerebellum</sub>=0.16). Relationships were driven by the psychosis group for cerebellum and cingulate nodes. Data-driven, connectome-wide analysis identified shared brain correlates of grip strength, overall function, and well-being in a sample of young adults with psychosis and healthy control subjects. This suggests that grip strength may be a marker of DMN connectivity, which may in turn be an important marker of overall health, even in young adult populations.",The American journal of psychiatry,2025,Heather Burrell Ward; Adam Beermann; Karlos Manzanarez Felix; Lipika Narisetti; Kathryn E Lewandowski; Michael Coleman; Sylvain Bouix; Daphne Holt; Dost Öngür; Alan Breier; Martha E Shenton; Roscoe O Brady; Alexandra B Moussa-Tooks
40556437,"Investigations Into the Outbreak of Chandipura Virus Encephalitis, Gujarat, India, 2024.","Chandipura virus, a Vesiculovirus, was first identified in India during an outbreak investigation of acute febrile illness in 1965. The virus first gained global attention after being implicated as the causative agent of an outbreak of acute viral encephalitis characterized by rapid clinical deterioration and death, in 2003. Since then, the virus has caused multiple outbreaks in central and western Indian states. During July 2024, an increased incidence of acute encephalitis was reported from Gujarat state. In response an outbreak investigation was carried out and Chandipura virus was identified as the major etiology, accounting for 23.45% of the cases. Clinically, the disease was characterized by rapid progression of illness, with total duration of illness ranging from 24 to 72 h in majority of the cases. Vomiting was found to be significantly more in cases of Chandipura viral encephalitis. In the current outbreak, multiorgan dysfunction was identified as a complication in Chandipura infections. Serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase and creatinine were found to be significantly elevated in cases of Chandipura encephalitis, compared to other etiologies of acute viral encephalitis. The case fatality rate in the current outbreak was 47.36%. Among the samples collected during the investigations, 69% humans and 8.76% animal samples tested positive for neutralizing antibodies against Chandipura virus. Fever surveillance during the outbreak also identified Chandipura IgM positive cases without neurological involvement, raising the possibility of Chandipura febrile illness.

40556376,Brain Microstructure Interrogation by Diffusion Tensor and Kurtosis Imaging in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Subtypes.,"Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is commonly used to assess the integrity of gray and white matter (WM) structures in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Beyond DTI, nontraditional diffusion techniques such as diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) have been shown to characterize brain tissue further. In this work, we aim to determine the utility of DKI in the differential diagnosis of PSP-Richardson syndrome (PSP-RS) and PSP with predominant parkinsonism (PSP-P) from Parkinson's disease (PD) and controls. A multishell diffusion-weighted sequence was acquired at 3 Tesla on a Siemens system in 22 patients with PSP-RS, 23 with PSP-P, 19 with PD, and 19 controls. Fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, kurtosis fractional anisotropy (KFA), and mean kurtosis (Kmean) were calculated for nine deep gray matter regions and six different WM tracts. DKI identified differences (not found by DTI) between control and PSP groups in the globus pallidum externus, subthalamic region, and putamen, with Kmean in the putamen able to differentiate PSP-RS and PD. DKI WM measurements in the body of the corpus callosum and dentatorubrothalamic tract differentiated PSP-RS from PD, and the corticostriatal tract differentiated PSP-P from PD. KFA in the body of the corpus callosum identified worse microstructural anomalies in PSP-RS compared to PSP-P. DKI metrics correlated with the severity of ocular motor impairment and parkinsonism scores. DKI measurements could differentiate PSP-RS, PSP-P, and PD and, hence, may be a promising imaging tool for studying structural neuropathological changes in PSP.",Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of Neuroimaging,2025,Rodolfo G Gatto; Hossam Youssef; Nha Trang Thu Pham; Farwa Ali; Heather M Clark; Julie Stierwalt; Yehkyoung Stephens; Mary M Machulda; Keith A Josephs; Jennifer L Whitwell
40556366,Effects of Dual Inhibition of VEGF-A and Angpt-2 on Angiogenesis and Lymphangiogenesis in an Alkali-Induced Corneal Injury Model.,"Corneal neovascularization (CNV) is frequently observed after various corneal injuries and corneal transplantation, leading to impairment of corneal transparency. Lymphangiogenesis and the inflammatory response often accompany CNV. Chemical injury is one of the most common causes of CNV, and alkali injury has been widely used as an animal model of this pathological state. We examined the effects of subconjunctival injection of an anti-VEGFA antibody (anti-VEGFA_ab), anti-ANGPT2 antibody (anti-ANGPT2_ab), and bispecific antibody against VEGFA and ANGPT2 (BsAb) in CNV using the alkali injury mouse model. The pathological indexes were examined using anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) and whole-mount immunostaining, and gene expression patterns were examined using RT-qPCR. Treatment with anti-VEGFA_ab, anti-ANGPT2_ab, or BsAb did not affect the swelled thickness of the cornea; however, angiogenesis, but not lymphangiogenesis, was hampered by the treatment of either one of the antibodies. We observed an increase in the mRNA levels of Vegfa, Angpt2, Il1b, and Cx3cr1 following alkali injury. The administration of BsAb suppressed the induction of Vegfa and Cx3cr1. Additionally, BsAb treatment enhanced the mRNA levels of Angpt1 in this model. This study demonstrates the potential of dual VEGFA and ANGPT2 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for CNV.",Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,2025,Hiroshi Kuribayashi; Toshiro Iwagawa; Souta Kadohara; Hirokazu Ohashi; Chihiro Kawaji; Takeru Iida; Tomoya Suzuki; Yuta Inokuchi; Tetsuhiro Soeda; Kosuke Saita; Makoto Aihara; Nobuyuki Ebihara; Takashi Miyai; Sumiko Watanabe
40556365,"Mental suffering, based on the experiences of people who are mentally ill.","To understand mental suffering from the point of view of the people affected. A qualitative study was carried out with 22 users of Primary Health Care units in Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil. The data were collected through individual interviews using the Oral Life History technique and analysed using Thematic Analysis. Two categories emerged: 'Vulnerabilities in the life history of people with mental suffering' and 'Perceiving and living with suffering and/or mental disorder'. The experience was permeated by situations of violence, poverty and abandonment, from childhood to adulthood. The recognition of mental suffering and its consequences was based on behavioural changes and work difficulties, which did not lead them to seek immediate treatment. The difficulty of living with suffering and/or mental disorder is directly related to adherence to treatment. Subjective aspects present in human life are still disregarded and the late search for professional help seems to result in the stigma and self-stigma of people with mental suffering and/or disorders.",Primary health care research & development,2025,Carla Aparecida Arena Ventura; Marciana Fernandes Moll; Camila Kaori Hayashi; Bruna Sordi Carrara; Igor de Oliveira Reis
40556363,Enhancing Duloxetine With Mirogabalin for Treating Taxane-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy in Advanced Lung Cancer.,"IntroductionTaxane-based cytotoxic anticancer drugs are a cornerstone of advanced lung cancer chemotherapy; however, they often result in chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Along with prolonged recovery, CIPN may cause irreversible damage. Consequently, dose reduction or discontinuation is justified, potentially impacting therapeutic efficacy. With no established treatment for CIPN, low-dose duloxetine is generally used as a supportive drug. However, studies have shown the potential effect of mirogabalin on CIPN. Therefore, at our hospital, patients with advanced lung cancer experiencing CIPN during taxane-based first-line therapy received low-dose duloxetine, and were subsequently treated with mirogabalin.MethodsIn this study, we conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of the impact of mirogabalin administration on 14 advanced lung cancer patients when duloxetine alone was deemed insufficient. The median age was 71 years (52-89 years), with 9 male and 5 female patients. The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) was utilized to evaluate outcomes, and Wilcoxon's signed rank-sum test was used in statistical analysis.ResultsThe median Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score decreased from 5.5 (interquartile range [IQR]: 4.5-7.0) before to 4.0 (IQR: 3.0-5.0) after mirogabalin administration (<i>P</i> = 0.041), indicating significant pain reduction.ConclusionThe addition of mirogabalin to duloxetine shows promise in alleviating CIPN in advanced lung cancer patients treated with taxane anticancer agents. These findings warrant further investigation and consideration for their integration into clinical practice for managing CIPN.",Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,2025,Yasuhiro Nakajima; Kozo Kuribayashi; Akio Tada; Akichika Nagano; Toshiyuki Minami; Arihiko Kanehiro; Takashi Kijima
40556345,"Voluntary wheel running exercise improves sleep disorder, circadian rhythm disturbance, and neuropathology in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease.","The sleep-wake cycle and circadian rhythm disturbances are common in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is not known if exercise has any benefit for the sleep disorders in AD. We conducted a 2-month voluntary wheel running (VWR) exercise (Ex) in an animal model of AD (APP<sup>SWE</sup>/PS1<sup>dE9</sup> mice). We assessed behavioral circadian rhythm, sleep structure, circadian clock genes, cognitive function, and neurodegeneration in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the hippocampus, and the cortex. After VWR exercise in the AD mice, the rapid eye movement sleep was increased by 89%. The levels of circadian clock genes were significantly changed (brain and muscle arnt-like protein 1 [BMAL1] and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptorsα [RORα] reduced by 45.7% and 36.4%, reverse erythroblastosis virusα (REV-ERBα) increased by 119%) in the SCN by immunofluorescence staining, with the mRNA levels were markedly altered (Bmal1 and Rorα decreased by 57% and 68%, Rev-erbα elevated by 79%) in the hypothalamus at Zeitgeber Time 1; phospho-tau 231 (p-tau231) was reduced by 35%, whereas vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) was elevated by 38.7% in the SCN. In addition, ionized calcium binding adapter molecude 1 (Iba1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), amyloid β (Aβ), and p-tau231 were significantly reduced in the hippocampus and cortex. Our results demonstrate that VWR exercise improves sleep disorders, cognitive deficits, and neuropathology in AD mice. Voluntary wheel running (VWR) exercise improves the behavioral circadian rhythm disorder and sleep structure disturbance in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice. After VWR exercise, there is a significant change in the expression levels of circadian clock genes, and a remarkable reduction of tau phosphorylation and axonal damage in the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The levels of beta-site amyloid precurson protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) are reduced in the hypothalamus after VWR exercise in AD mice. Furthermore, VWR exercise attenuates cognitive deficits, neuroinflammation, amyloid beta (Aβ), and phospho-tau protein accumulation in the hippocampus and cortex.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,2025,Yiying Hu; Long Niu; Yixin Chen; Huijia Yang; Xinhui Qiu; Fei Jiang; Cong Liu; Huaibin Cai; Weidong Le
40556318,"Novel early-onset Alzheimer-associated genes influence risk through dysregulation of glutamate, immune activation, and intracellular signaling pathways.","Most genetic studies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been focused on late-onset AD (LOAD). There are no large genetic studies on early-onset AD (EOAD). We performed a multi-ancestry (non-Hispanic European, African, and East Asian) genome-wide association study (GWAS) including a total of 7,349 cases and 17,887 control. Cases with age at onset younger than 70 years were included. Sensitivity analysis including cases with onset <65 was performed. Only controls older than 70 were included to decrease the risk of developing LOAD. We identified eight novel significant loci: six in the ancestry-specific analyses and two in the trans-ancestry analysis. By integrating gene-based analysis, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL), and functional annotations, we nominate eight novel genes that are involved in microglia activation, glutamate production, and signaling pathways. EOAD, although sharing genes with LOAD, harbors unique genes and pathways that could be used to create better prediction models or target identification. We performed the largest and first multi-ethnic genetic screening for early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and rates of ancillary study participation were described with means and frequencies. U.S. POINTER successfully enrolled a cohort, ages 60-79 years, which was ethno-racially inclusive (>30% individuals from groups often under-represented in clinical trials with cognitive outcomes) and 18% residing in neighborhoods with moderate or high levels of socioeconomic deprivation. Enrollees were cognitively intact but at increased risk for cognitive decline. Participation in ancillary studies (overall 73%) was uniformly high across sociodemographic groups. The trial cohort meets study goals and provides a basis for assessing multidomain lifestyle intervention effects on cognitive function and other health outcomes that will generalize to large portions of the at-risk US populations.

40556310,Differences in electrode placements between consensual and nonconsensual electroconvulsive therapy: retrospective chart review study.,"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is often used to treat severe mental disorders in individuals with impaired capacity to consent to the treatment. Little is known about how different types of electrode placement are used in consensual and nonconsensual ECT. To investigate whether there was an association between ECT consent status and electrode placement, given that ECT electrode placement affects efficacy and cognitive outcomes. Using a statewide database across 3 years in Victoria, Australia, we performed chi-squared tests to determine whether consent status (consensual versus nonconsensual) was associated with particular electrode placements. A three-way log-linear analysis was then conducted to examine whether age, gender, level of education and psychiatric diagnosis influenced the relationship between consent status and electrode placement. Given the comparable cognitive outcomes of right unilateral and bifrontal ECT, these electrode placements were combined in the analysis. In total, 3882 participants received ECT in the Victorian public health service during the study period. In the nonconsensual ECT group, 722 of 1576 individuals (45.81%) received bitemporal ECT, compared with 555 of 2306 (24.06%) in the consensual group (<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup> = 200.53; <i>P</i> < 0.0001; odds ratio: 2.6673, 95% CI: 2.3244-3.0608). This association remained significant after adjustment for gender, age, level of education and diagnosis. Significantly more participants in the nonconsensual ECT group received bitemporal ECT rather than right unilateral or bifrontal ECT compared with those in the consensual group. As bitemporal ECT is associated with more cognitive impairment, this choice of electrode placement in vulnerable patients who lack capacity to consent raises ethical considerations in the practice of ECT.",BJPsych open,2025,Hye-Sang Shin; Naveen Thomas; Yiting Amanda Gong; Rajeev Krishnadas; Alby Elias

However, little research has examined the effects of shift work interacting with changing occupational roles on sleep disorders. To determine the relationship between changing occupational roles, shift work and sleep disorders. The cohort study began in January 2013 and ended in January 2020. The survey used the stratified cluster sampling method, a total of 719 people were included in the analysis. The occupational roles were measured with the Occupational Role Questionnaire. Simultaneously the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to investigate the occurrence of sleep disorders. The number of people with sleep disorders was 227, with an incidence of 31.57%. The Role Overload (RR: 1.449, 95% CI: 1.028-2.042), Role Boundary (RR: 1.914, 95% CI: 1.369-2.676), Responsibility (RR: 1.391, 95% CI: 1.002-1.925), and Physical Environment (RR: 2.140, 95% CI: 1.550-5.956) may increase the risk of sleep disorders. The risk of sleep disorders in the elevated (baseline-follow up) occupational roles group was higher than that of the unchanged group (RR: 2.293, 95% CI: 1.620-3.245). Shift work situation (RR: 2.784, 95% CI: 1.987-3.901) may increase the risk of sleep disorders, and the interaction between changing occupational roles and shift work also increased the risk of sleep disorders (RR: 6.455, 95% CI: 3.283-12.691). The elevating occupational roles and shift work increase the risk of sleep disorders and have a synergistic effect, highlighting the importance of preventive measures against changing occupational roles and reasonably adjusting shift work patterns to reduce sleep disorders.","Work (Reading, Mass.)",2025,Yuxin Jin; Lingli Sang; Ziqi Zhou; Yangmei Wang; Jin Wang; Lin Song; Lejia Zhu; Jing Xiao; Yulong Lian

This research involved 120 patients and caregivers, ≥ 65 years, with cognitive impairment, was a consecutive sample from a tertiary hospital. Measures involved learning and problem solving tasks, motor movement, company, and food choices that addressed participants' requirements. Cognitive status was evaluated by MMSE and MoCA, physical performance measured with TUG, depression with GDS and nutritional status with BMI and blood sample. Subsequent evaluations were done at 3 month interval for 1 year. At the end of 12 months, improvement in cognitive function was noted by a mean of 4.0 points in MMSE, and mean of 3.8 points in MoCA. Physical fitness, depression status, nutritional status, social integration and sleep quality were also found to have significant changes across time. Also, the studies revealed an enhancement of patients' satisfaction as well as a reduction in caregiver burden.

40556132,Characteristics and Changes of Cingulate Gyrus Function and Perfusion in Patients With Anti-N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor Encephalitis.,"Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is an autoimmune condition associated with neuropsychiatric and cognitive deficits. Changes in the cingulate cortex may be central to this disorder. This study investigates subregional alterations in the cingulate cortex of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and their relationship to cognitive deficits using functional and perfusion imaging. Thirty-eight patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and 30 healthy controls (HC) underwent resting-state MRI and neuropsychological assessments. We measured low-frequency amplitude (fALFF), degree centrality (DC), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the cingulate cortex, and performed functional connectivity (FC) and CBF connectivity analyses. We also analyzed the relationship between subregional changes and cognitive impairment. Finally, we applied support vector machines (SVM) to classify patients and controls based on functional and perfusion features. Patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis showed significant cognitive impairments in memory and executive function, along with anxiety symptoms. Neuroimaging revealed decreased fALFF, DC, and CBF in the left pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC.L). FC between pgACC.L and several brain regions, including the parahippocampal gyrus and precuneus, was reduced. Additionally, pgACC.L exhibited altered CBF connectivity patterns with other brain regions. Moreover, the changes of fALFF, DC, and FC are related to the impaired cognitive function of patients. SVM classification based on fALFF, DC, and CBF features successfully distinguished patients from controls. Our findings suggest that pgACC abnormalities play a key role in the pathomechanism of anti-NMDAR encephalitis and may serve as biomarkers for disease monitoring.",Journal of neuroscience research,2025,Yuanyuan Guo; Yue Zhao; Chenglong Li; Juanjuan Zhang; Ling Wei; Qiang Wei; Nong Zhou; Kai Wang; Yanghua Tian

As versatile 3D culture systems <i>in vitro</i>, organoid models are emerging as a promising new tool for GBM research and combat. However, Matrigel, the most used extracellular matrix, is animal-derived with a complex composition and significant batch-to-batch variability, requiring further optimization for GBM organoid construction. Hydrogels, high-affinity polymers, have been widely employed in organoid construction for their customizable properties. In the present study, we selected and tested several commonly used hydrogel materials-hyaluronic acid methacryloyl (HAMA), chitosan methacryloyl (CSMA), and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA)-for the construction of GBM organoids. To address the limitations of a single Matrigel, we combined Matrigel with different hydrogels and found that hydrogels influenced glioblastoma stem cells and organoid formation in distinct ways. Matrigel-HAMA (MH) promoted the formation of independent spherical clones but with a significantly lower glioblastoma stem cell (GSC) proliferation rate. GelMA-HAMA(GH) could replace Matrigel preserving the characteristics and proliferative capacity of GSCs and supported the formation of more compact spherical clones than MH did. Further experimentation with ribosomal inhibitor CX5461 and CX5461 + IFNβ indicated that GH-based GBM organoid model constituted an efficient system for GBM drug testing, discovery, and precision medicine.",Cell transplantation,2025,Min Zhou; Ke Yue; Jingjing Zhao; Shuhua Gong; Yutong Xie; Wenyu Wu; Zhenzhou Li; Shuo Wu; Zhengliang Gao; Huan Wang; Jianrong Guo
40556110,Constructing the Autistic-Transgender Intersection: A Critical Discourse Analysis.,"Researchers increasingly report a statistical intersection between autism and transgender (trans) identities. Claims about this estimated relationship have recently proliferated within and beyond scientific research, particularly amidst escalating political struggles over the rights and recognition of trans people. Our study critically analyses discursive patterns among these claims to investigate how and to what effects diverse actors construct the intersection of autism and trans identities. We qualitatively analysed a purposive sample of 30 texts, including psychological research, clinical literature, news and opinion articles, state legislation, activist materials and autistic trans individuals' published narratives. We propose that claims about the autistic-trans intersection can be understood through four discursive types: psychiatrisation, repressive protection, medical management and affirmation and reclamation. These types represent differently patterned ways of (1) explaining medical vs. social 'causes' of the intersection and (2) legitimising versus delegitimising autistic trans identities, with each type promoting distinctive medical, cultural and political practices as responses. In this case study, we present the autistic-trans intersection as a site at which social actors with varied political aims and differential access to power reproduce and resist normative systems of gender and ability, pursue varied processes of de/medicalisation and negotiate expert knowledge and uncertainty.",Sociology of health & illness,2025,Maddie Kerr; Rebecca Ewert
40556091,"Assessment of the Hearing Threshold and Pattern of Tympanograms of Sickle Cell Disease Patients in Calabar, Nigeria.","Sickle cell disease patients often have high level of hearing threshold due to their susceptibility to pneumococcal infections, otitis media, and vaso-occlusive injury to the cochlea. This study aimed to determine the associations between the hemoglobin variants and hearing thresholds, hearing loss (HL), and tympanometry distributions in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). This hospital-based study was conducted between September 2019 and September 2021. We recruited 110 confirmed SS and SC patients from adult and pediatric sickle cell clinics, Calabar sickle cell clubs, and 110 healthy controls (AA and AS). Structured questionnaires were used to interview the study population, and all of them underwent ear, nose, and throat examinations, tympanometry, and pure tone audiometry for those aged >5 years after obtaining informed consent and medical ethics committee approval. Data were analyzed using international business machine (IBM) corporation statistical product and service solution (SPSS) version 25 software. Descriptive analysis was performed using tables, graphs, and charts, whereas inferential statistics were obtained using the Chi-square test of independence or Fisher's exact test, t-test, or analysis of variance (ANOVA). Statistical significance was set at P value < 0.05. The median ages of the SCD patients and their controls were 18 and 23 years, respectively. SCD patients have higher hearing thresholds, with 8.9% conductive loss, 4.5% unilateral mild mixed hearing loss, and 3.3% sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) (2.0% among the controls; P value of 0.669), and more commonly in the right ear. The overall HL prevalence was 16.7% SCD patients and 8.0% controls (double; P value of 0.067). SNHL is mostly mild and unilateral in nature and affects only adults. Type B tympanogram was only reported in children with SCD. HbSS was the most prevalent genotype, with greater (double) HL than controls, affecting the right ear of males. HL patterns included mild conductive HL, mixed HL, and SNHL. SCD could be a risk factor for OME.",Nigerian journal of clinical practice,2025,A G Adekanye; J B Okoi-Obuli; K O Akaba; A Umana; P M Francis
40556084,Assocıatıons Between Vıtamın D Receptor Gene Polymorphısms and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.,"Vitamin D deficiency is associated with Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), and Vitamin D supplementation may improve symptoms and electrophysiological findings in CTS patients. The biological effects of vitamin D may be modified by various genetic factors, including single nucleotide polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene. With this study, we aimed to show whether Taq I and Fok I polymorphisms of the VDR gene cause an increase in the occurrence and severity of carpal tunnel syndrome. 100 CTS patients and 100 healthy controls were included in this study. The severity of CTS was determined by electromyography and the patients were divided into 3 groups: mild, moderate and severe CTS. The Fok I and Taq I genotypes of the participants were determined from the peripheral blood samples taken from all participants. Genotypes and allele frequencies were compared between patient and control groups. VDR Fok I genotype distribution and allele frequency showed a significant relationship with the risk of developing CTS and its severity. Taq I, on the other hand, was not associated with the risk of developing CTS or its severity. VDR Fok I polymorphism increases the risk of developing CTS and the risk of severe CTS in the Turkish population. Further studies on this subject are needed to further understand the relationship between CTS and VDR polymorphisms and explain its mechanism.",Nigerian journal of clinical practice,2025,B Yildiz; F E Algul; E Yesilada
40556075,'I Feel Like I'm Hitting A Wall or There's A Narrow Tunnel': A Qualitative Study Based on Online Forum Posts by Women With Vaginismus.,"Women may find it difficult to seek face-to-face support, as topics related to sexuality are often considered taboo. The online environment makes it easier to interact with others and share stories while using an anonymous username. This study aimed to explore the lived experiences of women with vaginismus by analysing online forum posts. By examining unfiltered personal narratives, we sought to gain insights into their challenges, coping mechanisms, and the factors influencing their help-seeking behaviours without the constraints of predefined research questions. Qualitative content analysis was used to explore the lived experiences of women with vaginismus. For this study, we used a simple search phrase, such as 'vaginismus forum', on Google, the most widely used online search engine. In this context, we chose an online forum with different topics to collect data to explore different perspectives of vaginismus patients. Posts from this topic were collected between November 2020 and November 2023. A total of 17,900 posts from the relevant dates were reviewed for analysis. The data was coded and analysed using qualitative content analysis. Three main themes and 12 subthemes were identified: (1) Facing the reality of vaginismus, (2) Obstacles for women with vaginismus to get help, (3) Facilitators to fight vaginismus. This study provides qualitative evidence on the experiences of women with vaginismus, shedding light on the challenges they face. The findings highlight that while stigma, emotional distress, and unsupportive environments create barriers, supportive partners, professional guidance, and online communities play a crucial role in their recovery process. These insights emphasise the need to improve awareness and support mechanisms within healthcare and society.",Scandinavian journal of caring sciences,2025,Rahime Aksoy Bulgurcu; Berrak Mizrak Sahin
40556074,School-based mental health and psychosocial support interventions for children and adolescents with developmental disabilities in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review.,"To identify and evaluate the characteristics and reported effects of school-based mental health and psychosocial support interventions targeting children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) in low- and middle-income countries, as well as those involving their parents, teachers or peers. A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, ERIC, Global Health and PsycINFO was conducted in October 2024. Eligible studies included randomised controlled trials, quasi-experimental and qualitative research on school-based interventions in low- and middle-income countries for children and adolescents with NDDs (including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], autism, intellectual disabilities, epilepsy, cerebral palsy and foetal alcohol syndrome), as well as those involving their caregivers, teachers or peers. Only studies published in English, Spanish or Portuguese were included. A narrative synthesis was performed. A total of 2158 titles were screened, with 29 studies from 13 countries included. Most studies used a quasi-experimental design (n = 19, 66%). Nearly half focused on children and adolescents with NDDs only (n = 14, 48%), with intellectual disabilities being the most targeted condition (n = 12, 34%), followed by autism (n = 8, 23%) and ADHD (n = 8, 23%). Intervention strategies included multimodal approaches (n = 6, 21%) and educational workshops (n = 6, 21%). Targeted outcomes were social skills (n = 7, 16%) and knowledge attitudes and practice (n = 5, 12%). Lifelong learning (n = 11, 33%) and educational system-strengthening interventions (n = 10, 31%) were the primary content areas. The majority of studies exhibited a moderate to high risk of bias. Schools offer strategic platforms for delivering mental health and psychosocial support interventions to children and adolescents with NDDs in low- and middle-income countries, involving families, teachers and peers. While improvements in social skills and knowledge, attitudes and practices were reported, heterogeneity and methodological limitations constrain the generalisability of findings. Future research should address long-term impacts and expand to underrepresented conditions.",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,2025,Maria Jose Alpuche De Lille; Renata da Teixeira da Silva; Tracey Smythe
40556069,Efficacy of Educational Programs for the Empowerment and Well-Being of Caregivers of Children With Mental Disorders: A Systematic Review.,"Family caregivers play an important role in providing care and support to children with mental illness. Caring for a child with a mental disorder is heavy and stressful for family members. The current review aimed to summarise the conclusions of these programs and identify the available gaps for planning and designing to help this family and the people in contact with it. This systematic review was conducted until July 24, 2024. PRISMA guidelines were used in this study to retrieve all national and international studies. This research aimed to evaluate the correlation between interventions designed for caregivers of children with mental health disorders and a wide range of outcomes, including subjective and objective outcomes. Measures of burden, general well-being, quality of life, sleep quality, knowledge acquisition, self-efficacy, and physiological health-while contrasted with standard supportive practices or alternative control conditions. The findings of this study, which were based on the educational content provided to these families, were categorised into five categories: (1) psychoeducational psychotherapy, (2) parent management training, (3) telehealth interventions, (4) family therapies and (5) support groups. Research has shown that targeted interventions can significantly increase the quality of life for caregivers of children with mental disorders, but more empirical research is needed to confirm the findings and develop stronger support systems alongside tailored programs that these caregivers need to face distinct challenges.

40556027,Robust molecular subgrouping and reference-free aneuploidy detection in medulloblastoma using low-depth whole genome bisulfite sequencing.,"Medulloblastoma comprises four principal molecular disease groups and their component subgroups, each with distinct molecular and clinical features. Group assignment is currently achieved diagnostically using Illumina DNA methylation microarray. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) capacity is rapidly expanding in the clinical setting and the development of platform-independent, sequence-based assays of molecular group offers significant potential. Specifically, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) enables assessment of genome-wide methylation status at single-base resolution, however its routine application has been limited by high DNA input requirements, cost, and a lack of pipelines tailored to more rapidly-acquired and cost-effective low-depth (< 10x) sequencing data. We utilised WGBS data for 69 medulloblastomas, comprising 35 in-house low-depth (~ 10x) and 34 publicly available high-depth (~ 30x) samples, alongside cerebellar controls (n = 8), all with matched DNA methylation microarray data. We assessed quality (QC) and imputation approaches using low-pass WGBS data, assessed inter-platform correlation and identified molecular groups and subgroups by directly integrating matched/associated loci from WGBS sample data with the MNP classifier probeset. We further assessed and optimised reference-free aneuploidy detection using low-pass WGBS and assessed concordance with microarray-derived calls. We developed and optimised pipelines for processing, QC, and analysis of low-pass WGBS data, suitable for routine molecular subgrouping and reference-free aneuploidy assessment. We demonstrate that low-pass WGBS data can (i) be integrated into existing array-trained models with high assignment probabilities for both principal molecular groups (97% concordance) and molecular subgroups (94.2% concordance), and (ii) detect clinically relevant focal copy number changes, including SNCAIP, with greater sensitivity than microarray approaches. Low-pass WGBS performs equivalently to array-based methods at comparable cost. Finally, its ascertainment of the full methylome enables elucidation of additional biological complexity and inter-tumoural heterogeneity that has hitherto been inaccessible. These findings provide proof-of-concept for clinical adoption of low-pass WGBS, applied using standard WGS technology.",Acta neuropathologica communications,2025,Dean Thompson; Jemma Castle; Martin Sill; Stefan M Pfister; Simon Bailey; Debbie Hicks; Steven C Clifford; Edward C Schwalbe
40556014,Does treatment of adolescent depression reduce risk of later psychosis: A quasi-experimental study of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment in a total population cohort.,"Psychotic disorders are frequently preceded by depressive disorders, and it has been hypothesized that treatment of depression in youth may reduce risk for later psychosis. Using quasi-experimental methods, we estimated the causal relationship between the treatment of adolescent depression with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and the risk of later psychosis. We used data linkage from multiple national Finnish registries for all individuals (<i>n</i> = 697,289) born between 1987 and 1997 to identify depression diagnosed before age 18, cumulative SSRI treatment within three years of diagnosis, and diagnoses of non-affective psychotic disorders by end of follow-up (age 20-29). We used instrumental variable analyses, exploiting variability in prescribing across hospital districts to estimate causal effects. Analyses were conducted using two-stage least squares modelling. Sensitivity analyses examined effects stratified by confounders and effects of specific SSRIs. Our final sample included 22,666 individuals diagnosed with depression in adolescence, of whom 60.2% (<i>n</i> = 13,650) had used SSRIs. 10.7% of adolescents with depression went on to be diagnosed with a non-affective psychotic disorder. SSRI treatment for adolescent depression was not associated with a reduced risk of developing a psychotic disorder (one-year <i>β =</i> 0.04,CI:-0.01 to 0.09; two-years <i>β =</i> 0.02,CI:-0.06 to 0.09; three-years <i>β =</i> -0.02,CI:-0.08 to 0.05). Our quasi-experimental investigation does not support the hypothesis that treatment of adolescent depression reduces the subsequent risk of psychosis. Our findings question the assumption that treatment of common mental health disorders in youth may impact the risk of developing severe mental illnesses in adulthood.",European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists,2025,Colm Healy; Kirsite O'Hare; Ulla Lång; Martta Kerkelä; Jonah Byrne; Juha Veijola; Anna Pulakka; Johanna Metsälä; Eero Kajantie; Ian Kelleher
40556004,Effect of deterioration of swallowing functions on the frailty status in older adults: a longitudinal cohort study.,"Deterioration of swallowing function (DSF) is common among aging adults and can lead to negative health outcomes such as increased risk of malnutrition. However, the longitudinal relationship between the DSF and frailty status remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether declining swallowing function is linked to frailty progression in independent older adults. This study included 795 community-dwelling Japanese individuals aged ≥ 65 years who participated in two surveys: one at baseline and one after two years. Swallowing function was evaluated using the repetitive saliva swallowing test, tongue pressure test, and questionnaire. DSF was identified by meeting more than one of three criteria: Repeated Saliva Swallow Test below 3, tongue pressure under 27.4 kPa for men and 26.5 kPa for women, and a ""yes"" response to the questionnaire. Frailty status was assessed using the Kihon Checklist, with participants showing a decline categorized into the ""aggravation group."" Oral function (number of teeth, occlusal force, masticatory performance, and oral dryness) and physical function (body mass index, gait speed, grip strength, and skeletal muscle mass index) were evaluated. Comparisons between the two groups were made using the Student's t-test or the χ2 test. Differences among the three groups were assessed using the one-way analysis of variance or the χ2 test. Significant differences in continuous variables were analyzed using the Least Significant Difference method, with P-values adjusted using the Bonferroni correction. Initially, 87 (10.9%) participants were frail. By follow-up, 149 participants (37.9%) had progressed to frailty, 83 of whom (55.7%) exhibited impaired swallowing function at baseline. At baseline, frailty was significantly associated with age, gait speed, decreased swallowing function, number of functional teeth, occlusal force, and masticatory performance. None of the three swallowing function assessment methods were significantly associated with the progression of frailty. In contrast, logistic regression analysis of frailty progression showed that impaired swallowing function was a significant explanatory variable (OR, 1.53; 95% CI: 1.04-2.21). This study found a significant association between frailty and multiple factors, particularly oral function. Specifically, diminished swallowing function has emerged as a notable independent predictor of frailty progression.",BMC geriatrics,2025,En-Chih Weng; Yoko Hasegawa; Tasuku Yoshimoto; Ma Therese Sta Maria; Koutatsu Nagai; Naoko Sato; Kana Tokumoto; Kazuhiro Hori; Hiroshi Kusunoki; Hiromitsu Kishimoto; Ken Shinmura
40555967,Innovative Synchronous Spectrofluorometric Method for Assessing a Novel Drug Combination in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: In Vivo Human Application With Greenness and Sustainability Evaluation.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe neurological disorder that causes damage to sensory neurons, then paralysis and death. A novel combination of celecoxib (CXP) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) has recently been used to enhance both motor performance and CNS cell morphology, alterations in the rate of disease progression, quality of life, and survival, which passed phase IIb RCT study. Celecoxib is classified as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that has a synergistic effect for the treatment of ALS, which is a severe neurological disorder. A new sustainable, simple, sensitive, and environmentally friendly synchronous spectrofluorimetric approach (SSF) was established to simultaneously estimate celecoxib and ciprofloxacin in pure form and biological fluids. The approach depends on synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy, where CXP and CIP were detected at 364 and 438 nm, correspondingly, using Δλ of 80-nm utilizing sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) micellar system, which considerably improved synchronous fluorescence intensity. The approach was validated and revealed excellent linearity with concentrations varying from 10 to 10,000 and 5 to 20,000 ng/mL for CXP and CIP; correspondingly, CXP and CIP showed extremely low limits of detection (LODs) 0.58-0.24 ng/mL, which guarantee the sensitivity of the proposed approach. The suggested approach was successfully implemented to analyze the co-administered pharmaceuticals in their pure form and actual human plasma after concurrent oral administration of both drugs, which may be employed in an inquiry on the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of human plasma to the new coming PrimeC pharmaceutical formulation. Ultimately, the method's remarkable greenness was proved by evaluating its greenness profile using various assessment strategies. The findings revealed that the SSF approach is a sustainable and environmentally friendly analytical approach.",Luminescence : the journal of biological and chemical luminescence,2025,Amal B Ahmed; Mohammed E Draz; Haydy Asad; Ibrahim A Naguib; Fadwa H Edrees
40555935,Inhibition of Rac1 Attenuated Propofol-Induced Neurotoxicity in the Hippocampal Dentate Gyrus in Developing Mice.,"Accumulating evidence from animals has shown that multiple exposures to general anesthetics during brain development may cause extensive neuronal apoptosis and long-term memory impairments. However, the underlying mechanism is still poorly understood. In the present study, C57BL/6 mice were administered with propofol at postnatal days 19-21. We found that propofol exposure significantly increased neuronal apoptosis in the mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus, as evidenced by cleaved caspase-3 immunofluorescence. Additionally, propofol exposure increased the activation and expression of Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) in the dentate gyrus, as shown by western blotting. Modulating Rac1, either through inhibition or overexpression, was found to mitigate or exacerbate propofol-induced neuronal apoptosis, respectively. We further demonstrated that propofol decreased the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein phosphorylated serine/threonine kinase Akt via Rac1. The results of the open field and Morris water maze test further revealed that silencing Rac1 alleviated propofol-induced cognitive dysfunction. Our findings demonstrated that propofol exposure induced neuronal apoptosis and long-term cognitive dysfunction in the mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus by regulating Rac1.",Neurochemical research,2025,Yuan Li; Haifeng Duan; Qi Wang; Yi Lin; Zhoujing Yang; Zhiru Wang; Yingwei Wang; Kai Wei; Daojie Xu
40555892,Quaking Protein in Myelin Maintenance and Regeneration in the Central Nervous System.,"Synthesized by oligodendrocytes (OLGs) in the central nervous system (CNS), the myelin sheath is a multilamellar structure that enables the rapid transmission of action potentials and provides metabolic support to the axons it surrounds. In multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic neurological disorder, the myelin membrane becomes the target of immune-mediated attacks. These attacks trigger the release of inflammatory cytokines and activate microglia (MG) and astrocytes, leading to severe demyelination and neurodegeneration. Quaking (QKI) is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that plays a critical role in CNS myelination by regulating RNA metabolism and lipid homeostasis in glial cells. Through its major isoforms-QKI-5, QKI-6, and QKI-7-QKI orchestrates essential post-transcriptional processes in OLGs, including splicing, stability, nuclear export, and local translation of key myelin transcripts. QKI deficiency alters the expression of numerous genes involved in axonal ensheathment and myelination pathways, such as MBP, PLP1, MAG, and Nfasc155. QKI also modulates cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis by acting as a transcriptional coactivator, ensuring the proper lipid composition of the myelin sheath. In MG, QKI regulates phagosome maturation and the expression of inflammatory genes, thus promoting efficient clearance of myelin debris and fostering a permissive environment for remyelination. Reduced QKI expression has been documented in MS and its experimental models. In this context, this review summarizes current evidence positioning QKI as a central regulator of myelin maintenance and regeneration and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for demyelinating diseases.",Molecular neurobiology,2025,Laura Thomas; María Verónica Galante Pasquini; Laura Andrea Pasquini
40555887,The Role of Interpersonal Characteristics in Early and Developing Therapeutic Alliance Among Periadolescents with Anxiety.,"Little work has examined associations between interpersonal factors and changes in the therapeutic alliance. We examined the association between baseline youth family and peer interpersonal characteristics and therapeutic alliance throughout treatment in a sample of anxious youths who received cognitive behavioral therapy or client-centered therapy. Youths (N = 135; M = 10.94; SD = 1.46) were in a randomized clinical trial for anxiety disorders. Interpersonal characteristics were assessed via parent-report, youth self-report, and observational methods. Lower levels of parent-rated shyness, higher levels of positive interpersonal style, and being female were associated with higher early therapist-rated alliance. Being female was associated with more rapid increases in therapist-rated alliance. Friendship quality, younger age, and lower aggressive interpersonal style predicted higher baseline youth-rated alliance. Positive interpersonal style and stronger family functioning were associated with more rapid increases in youth-rated alliance. Therapists should be aware of client interpersonal characteristics when working with youth.",Child psychiatry and human development,2025,Samantha D Sorid; Dana L McMakin; Jennifer S Silk; Cecile D Ladouceur; Erika E Forbes; Gregory J Siegle; Ronald E Dahl; Philip C Kendall; Neal D Ryan; Thomas M Olino
40555884,Association between vitamin D level and sleep quality in the elderly population: a prospective cohort study.,"Vitamin D is essential not only for skeletal health but also for regulating sleep. Recent studies suggest a link between vitamin D deficiency and poor sleep quality, including lower sleep efficiency and shorter sleep duration. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between sleep quality and serum vitamin D levels in healthy elderly individuals. This study examined the association between serum vitamin D levels and sleep quality in individuals aged 60 years and above residing in Taipei's Health & Culture Village and Active Aging Center. A total of 465 participants were enrolled, with those exhibiting specific organ abnormalities or dysfunctions excluded. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and vitamin D levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The relationships between vitamin D levels and PSQI scores were analyzed, with a focus on the daytime dysfunction component of the PSQI. Among the seven domains of the PSQI, the daytime dysfunction domain had the strongest statistical association with serum vitamin D levels (p = 0.044). Participants without daytime dysfunction had significantly higher vitamin D levels than did those with daytime dysfunction (p = 0.04). No significant associations were detected between vitamin D levels and other factors, such as sex or age. Higher serum vitamin D levels are associated with better sleep quality in elderly individuals, particularly in those without daytime dysfunction. This finding highlights the potential importance of maintaining adequate vitamin D levels to promote healthy sleep patterns in older adults.",Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung,2025,Wei-Hsuan Lee; Yu-Hsi Chen; Tsai-Yu Wang; Wen-Jui Chang; Ting-Wei Liao; Wei-Syun Hung; Shih-Wei Lin; Ning-Hung Chen; Ji-Tseng Fang; Li-Pang Chuang
40555878,Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children with a history of febrile seizures: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"There exists a disagreement in the current literature on whether febrile seizures (FS) are associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This systematic review and meta-analysis was thus commenced to determine the association between childhood FS and ADHD and quantitatively measure its magnitude. This review was reported according to the PRISMA and MOOSE guideline. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Google Scholar, CINAHL, Scopus, and PsycINFO were systematically searched for observational studies reporting the occurrence of ADHD in patients with childhood FS. Then, unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were extracted from studies and pooled. The protocol for this review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024541299). Our meta-analysis included 12 studies with a total of 958,082 participants. FS was associated with 1.91 times greater odds of ADHD in the unadjusted analysis (95% CI = 1.32 to 2.76) and 2.68 times greater odds in the adjusted analysis (95% CI = 1.21 to 5.93). Subgroup and meta-regression analyses identified mean baseline age, follow-up duration, study aim, ADHD diagnostic criteria, study design, and region as moderators of the overall effect. In the present meta-analysis, a significant association between childhood FS and later ADHD was observed. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the association between the two disorders. Our findings contradict the common belief that FS are benign, thus suggesting that children with FS may benefit from closer developmental monitoring given the observed association with ADHD. • Febrile seizure (FS) is the most common type of seizure in childhood, affecting 2% to 5% in all infants and children between ages 6 through 60 months. • Several studies and guidelines have determined FS as a universally benign disorder, but in recent years, an increasing amount of literature has challenged this idea. • Our findings suggest a positive association between FS and ADHD, challenging the widely accepted belief that childhood FS is benign. • Subgroup analyses and meta-regression have identified study aim, ADHD diagnostic criteria, study design, region, mean age, and follow-up duration as factors that modify the overall effect.",European journal of pediatrics,2025,Hyunjun Woo; Sang-Ung Lee; Dahyeon Yun; Suha Jeong; Hyewon Cho; Yong-Sik Kim
40555874,Effectiveness of an online mindfulness-based stress-reduction intervention to reduce anxiety in breast cancer survivors: a randomized-controlled trial.,"This study evaluated the efficacy of an online mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention in reducing anxiety among breast cancer (BC) survivors, leveraging the potential advantages of digital delivery to enhance psychosocial care for this population. In this randomized controlled trial, 68 BC survivors with elevated anxiety levels were assigned to either an 8-week online MBSR intervention (n = 33) or a waitlist control group (n = 35). Anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), fatigue (FACIT-F), insomnia (ISI), cancer-related worry (CWS), vasomotor symptoms (MENQOL), and mindful awareness (MAAS) were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and at 5- and 8-months follow-up. Compared to the control group, MBSR participants showed significant reductions in anxiety (mean difference -4.13 points, 95CI -6.79 to -1.46, p = 0.003), depression (mean score difference -6.03, p < 0.001), fatigue (mean difference + 6.03, p = 0.002), insomnia (mean difference -3.97, p = 0.026), and cancer-related worry (mean difference -4.57, p = 0.003) at post-intervention, but no change in vasomotor symptoms (p > 0.05). MBSR participants also demonstrated increased mindful awareness (mean difference + 1.00, p = 0.004) that persisted through follow-up. The proportion of participants with clinically significant anxiety decreased from 96% pre-intervention to 38% at 8-months follow-up in the MBSR group, compared to relatively stable rates (88% to 87%) in the control group. Online MBSR is a potentially effective intervention for reducing anxiety and improving psychological well-being in BC survivors. This accessible format may help overcome barriers to psychosocial care for cancer survivors.

40555858,"Bone Mineral Density and Trabecular Bone Score in Children, Adolescents and Young Adults with Familial Dysautonomia.","Familial dysautonomia (FD) is characterized by skeletal morbidity, including osteoporosis and increased fracture risk. We aimed to assess bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS) in individuals with FD, and to explore correlations with disease severity. This retrospective study included all the patients with FD who performed at least one dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan at our institution during 2015-2023. Demographic and clinical data obtained from medical records included: medical treatment, anthropometric measurements, Functional Severity Scale (FuSS) score, balance assessment, the Brief Ataxia Rating Scale score, ambulation ability, blood test results and fracture history. Forty-one patients (21 males) had at least one DXA scan. The median age at the first scan was 25 years (range 7-47). The mean BMD Z-score was - 1.2 ± 1.5 at the lumbar spine and - 1.3 ± 1.1 at the bilateral proximal femur. The mean TBS Z-score was - 1.8 ± 1.6.

40555833,Granzyme K<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells slow tauopathy progression by targeting microglia.,"Neurodegenerative diseases activate innate and adaptive immune responses that can either slow or accelerate disease progression. Here, we sought to define beneficial immune pressures that emerge during tauopathy development in mice and humans. Using mice that express mutant human tau in neurons, we observed that microglia slowed tauopathy development by controlling the spread of phosphorylated tau (pTau) in the central nervous system and blood. However, over time microglia converted into distressed antigen-presenting cells, acquired neuronal transcripts and were targeted by resident, clonally expanded CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. These cells did not express traditional effector molecules, such as IFNγ, TNF or granzymes a/b/c, but instead deposited granzyme K (GZMK) onto microglia and were regulated by immune checkpoint proteins (TIGIT, PD-1), as blockade of TIGIT and PD-1 enhanced disease progression. GZMK<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells also targeted microglia in pTau-rich human brain lesions resulting from age, Alzheimer's disease or chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Deletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in mice promoted the emergence of distressed microglia containing neuronal transcripts, markedly enhanced pTau spread and accelerated neurological decline. These data demonstrate that GZMK<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are a signature of tauopathy development and could potentially be harnessed to slow disease progression.",Nature immunology,2025,Hannah D Mason; Yvonne L Latour; Christopher T Boughter; Kory R Johnson; Dragan Maric; Cayce E Dorrier; Vivian A Guedes; Chen Lai; Patrick C Duncker; Alexis M Johnson; Monica Manglani; Jessica M Gill; Daniel P Perl; Martin Meier-Schellersheim; Dorian B McGavern
40555745,GSDME-mediated pyroptosis in microglia exacerbates demyelination and neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis: insights from humans and cuprizone-induced demyelination model mice.,"Demyelination, a hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS), disrupts neural conduction due to myelin sheath degradation. Microglia-mediated inflammation plays a pivotal role in this process, with emerging evidence implicating gasdermin E (GSDME) in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. However, the specific role of GSDME in MS remains unclear. Here, we investigated the involvement of GSDME in MS using brain tissues from MS patients and cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination model mice. We observed elevated GSDME expression in the central nervous system (CNS) lesions of MS patients, with pronounced GSDME cleavage in microglia at injury sites. Genetic knockout of Gsdme alleviated CPZ-induced motor deficits, demyelination, and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, caspase-3 inhibition significantly suppressed GSDME activation, resulting in reduced demyelination, motor coordination impairment, and neuroinflammation. In an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, caspase-3/GSDME-mediated microglial pyroptosis critically mediated the progression of neuroinflammation and white matter demyelination. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that GSDME regulated the expression of genes related to disease-associated microglia (DAMs) and impaired microglial autophagy, a process critical for myelin debris clearance. Gsdme knockout downregulated the expression of genes associated with DAMs and CPZ-induced microglia-driven demyelination while increasing the expression of remyelination-related genes (Cybb and Cd74). In vitro, GSDME suppression promoted microglial autophagy and myelin debris clearance. Collectively, our findings highlight GSDME-mediated pyroptosis as a key driver of demyelination and neuroinflammation in MS, suggesting novel therapeutic targets for neuroinflammatory disorders.",Cell death and differentiation,2025,Danjie Wang; Tongtong Zhang; Qi Shao; Xinyi Wu; Xiaoqiang Zhao; Hongyu Zhang; Yumeng Wang; Jingxian Sun; Xuechun Chang; Keying Zhu; Shuai Wu; Li Cao; Wankun Chen; Jun Wang
40555730,"Comparative efficacy and safety of daridorexant, lemborexant, and suvorexant for insomnia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.","In order to appraise the risk-benefit balance of the three available dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs; daridorexant, lemborexant, and suvorexant) for the management of adults with insomnia, we conducted a systematic review and random-effects model network meta-analysis. Included were all published double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of these agents. Outcomes included subjective time to sleep onset at month 1 (sTSO, primary), subjective total sleep time at month 1 (sTST, co-primary), subjective wake after sleep onset at month 1, Insomnia Severity Index scores at month 1, all-cause discontinuation, discontinuation due to adverse events, and the incidence of individual adverse events such as somnolence, dizziness, falls, headache, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infection. This meta-analysis included eight trials (5198 adults, average age = 56.33 years, 67.84% female). The treatment arms included daridorexant 25 mg/day (DAR25), daridorexant 50 mg/day (DAR50), lemborexant 5 mg/day (LEM5), lemborexant 10 mg/day (LEM10), suvorexant 20 mg/day (15 mg/day for people ≥65years, SUV20/15), and placebo. All active-treatments outperformed placebo in terms of all efficacy outcomes. The standardized mean difference (95% CI) in primary outcomes ranged from; sTSO: -0.430 (-0.568, -0.292) for LEM10 to -0.164 (-0.296, -0.031) for SUV20/15 and sTST: -0.475 (-0.593, -0.357) for DRA50 to -0.206 ( -0.330, -0.082) for LEM5. An additional sensitivity analysis suggested that DRA25, LEM10, and SUV20/15 were associated with a higher incidence of somnolence compared to a placebo. Considering that there is no evidence that DORAs are associated with physiological tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, or rebound insomnia when abruptly discontinued, and that sleep architecture is not adversely affected, the DORAs appear to be a favorable choice in managing insomnia disorder in adults.",Translational psychiatry,2025,Taro Kishi; Toshikazu Ikuta; Leslie Citrome; Kenji Sakuma; Masakazu Hatano; Shun Hamanaka; Yasufumi Nishii; Nakao Iwata
40555725,"Not just old wine in new bottles: Polygenic liability for ADHD is associated with electrophysiological affective-motivational processing beyond anxiety, depression, and ODD.","In attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), emotional features account for heterogeneity and exacerbate severity of behavioral and functional impairments, beyond cognitive and comorbidity features. Yet, debate remains about the extent to which, in ADHD, such emotional features are a ""core feature"", i.e. whether ADHD should be conceptualized as encompassing difficulties with regulating not only activity, attention, and impulses but also processing and regulating emotions. We aimed to address this issue by examining the extent to which in adolescents, ADHD polygenic scores (PGSs) are associated with electrophysiological indices of affective-motivational processing, measured during a monetary punishment/reward feedback paradigm. ADHD PGSs were negatively associated, in n = 166 adolescents (M<sub>age</sub> = 15.76 years, SD = 1.07; 42.77% girls), with amplitude values of an occipitoparietal event-related potential (i.e. late positive potential) and were positively associated, in n = 84 adolescents (M<sub>age</sub> = 15.76 years, SD = 1.05; 41.67% girls), with fronto-centro-parietal alpha event-related desynchronization. Across analyses, covariates were anxiety, depression, and ADHD with comorbid disruptive behavior disorder PGSs; ADHD, internalizing, and oppositional defiant disorder severity; childhood maltreatment; current ADHD medication; and baseline values of the outcome. Findings were replicated in sensitivity analyses with blocks of conceptually related covariates entered separately. In adolescents, electrophysiological indices of affective-motivational processing are associated principally with genetic liability for ADHD but not comorbidity genetic liability or comorbidity manifest symptoms.",Translational psychiatry,2025,Kristóf Ágrez; Zsombor Visky; György Hámori; Mária Takács; Attila J Pulay; János M Réthelyi; Nóra Bunford
40555718,Predicting individual treatment response in alcohol use disorders: a reverse translational proof-of-concept study.,"The development of medications for alcohol use disorders (AUD) faces stagnation, as promising drugs failed to translate in clinic. Screening on homogeneous groups of animals drugs later tested on heterogeneous clinical cohorts may contribute to the translational gap. We hypothesized that a preclinical model of AUD accounting for inter-individual heterogeneity would predict the lack of efficacy of a drug that failed clinical trials (Memantine) and the efficacy of an approved AUD medication (Naltrexone). Baseline alcohol drinking, motivation, and cued reinstatement were screened in NIH genetically heterogeneous-stock rats before testing the effect of Memantine and Naltrexone on alcohol (ASA) and saccharin self-administration (SSA). Based on the individual effect of Memantine and Naltrexone on ASA, rats were allocated into independent clusters of responders and non-responders to each drug. The same doses of Memantine reduced both ASA and SSA in both clusters, while Naltrexone selectively reduced ASA in responder rats. Naltrexone responders were in majority males, while non-responders were mostly females. Naltrexone responders and non-responders showed similar alcohol drinking and motivation, but non-responders did not show cued reinstatement of alcohol seeking. In line with clinical observations, in a model accounting for individual heterogeneity Memantine failed to selectively reduce ASA, the population could be unbiasedly clustered in responders and non-responders, and cued reactivity associated with Naltrexone response in males. These results advocate the use of inter-individual heterogeneity for preclinical prediction of drug efficacy in AUD before clinical trials. In addition, we observed sex differences in response to Naltrexone that can be back-translated in clinic.",Translational psychiatry,2025,Sara De Carlo; Hela Mrizak; Andrea Della Valle; Veronica Lunerti; Manthoula O Kyratzi; Alessandra Mammone; Antonio Lacorte; Adana Keshishian; Min Li; Esi Domi; Di Qin; Leah Solberg Woods; Laura Soverchia; Massimo Ubaldi; Roberto Ciccocioppo; Nazzareno Cannella

Clinical data of a child with gastrointestinal hemorrhage with CRMCC admitted to the Hepatology Department of Hunan Children's Hospital in September 2019 were collected, and peripheral blood DNA of the child and his parents were analyzed by whole exome sequencing. Candidate variants were validated by Sanger sequencing, followed by bioinformatics analysis, American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) Standards and Guidelines for the Interpretation of Sequence Variants pathogenicity classification, and protein structure prediction. A literature search with ""Coats Plus syndrome"" or ""Cerebroretinal microangiopathy with calcifications and cysts"" as keywords was conducted at PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang databases to include recently published studies (up to December 2023). This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Hunan Children's Hospital (Ethics No. KY2020-07). Informed consent for clinical research was obtained from the guardian of the child. The proband was a 10-year-10-month-old boy. The clinical manifestations were intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, liver fibrosis, panhemopenia, bilateral exudative retinopathy, intracranial lesions and facial pigmentation. WES and Sanger sequencing revealed two novel heterozygous variants in the CTC1 gene: c.787G>A (p.Val263Met) in exon 5 and c.2930C>G (p.Ser977Cys) in exon 17, which were inherited from his mother and father, respectively. According to ACMG pathogenicity classification, both missense variants were classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Protein structure prediction showed the absence of LIG_SH3_3 motif and LIG_SH3_3 motif, and the p.Ser977Cys mutation may affect the binding between CST (CTC1-STN1-TEN) complex and DNA strand. The child had continued to experience recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding episodes despite propranolol treatment, but the condition was controlled after liver transplantation. According to the predefined literature search strategy of this study, a total of 10 relevant articles on pediatric CRMCC patients were retrieved, involving 11 children with gastrointestinal bleeding. Pharmacological and endoscopic therapies play a certain role in the management of CRMCC children complicated with gastrointestinal bleeding. The CTC1 gene c.787G>A and c.2930C>G variants probably underlay CRMCC in this child. This study has broadened the variation spectrum of CTC1-related diseases and provided a basis for genetic counseling.

This study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Hangzhou Children's Hospital (Ethics No. 2021-06). The child was a 7-year and 4-month-old male. He has short stature, numerous café-au-lait spots on the neck and trunk, and special facial features such as a full forehead, wide interpupillary distance, a low nasal bridge, and low-set ears. The results of Trio-WES showed that the he had harbored the NF1 gene c.3773G>T (p.W1258L) mutation, which was verified by Sanger sequencing to be de novo in origin. The NF1 gene was associated with NFNS, which has an autosomal dominant inheritance. According to the ACMG guidelines, this variant was judged to be a likely pathogenic variant (PS2+PM2+PP3+PP2). No pathogenic variant in genes associated with Noonan syndrome, such as PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, RIT1, and KRAS, was found. The child with NFNS has clinical features such as short stature, special facial features, and café-au-lait spots.

Clinical data of pregnant women with fetus at a high risk for trisomy/monosomy 13 by NIPT at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from May 2016 to May 2024 were reviewed, and relevant data such as Z-score, positive predictive value (PPV) and fetal fraction (FF) were analyzed to assess the correlation between them. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital (No. 2018-YB-08). 71 fetuses were found to have a high risk by NIPT, including 58 cases for trisomy 13 (T13) and 13 cases for monosomy 13 (M13). 52 women had opted invasive prenatal diagnosis and 13 cases were confirmed, which yielded a positive prediction value (PPV) of 25%. 12 fetuses were confirmed as T13 (PPV = 29.3%; 12/41), 1 was confirmed as M13 (PPV = 9.1%; 1/11). The PPV had increased along with the Z-score. Fetal faction (FF) was not correlated with the age of woman but gestational age, and was negatively correlated with the body mass index. No statistical difference was found in FF and Z-score between true- and false-positive fetuses, and there was a weak correlation between the Z-score and FF. The PPV of the NIPT could be improved by combining the results of ultrasonography. The high false positive rate for T13 may be related to confined placental mosaicism, PPV is related to the Z-score, which in turn is related to FF. High-risk women are strongly recommended to undergo genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis. Clinicians should consider relevant information such as the age of women, gestational age, indication for prenatal screening, Z-score, PPV, and FF in order to accurately interpret the result of NIPT, reduce anxiety, and avoid direct termination of the pregnancy.",Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,2025,Peng Dai; Ganye Zhao; Yanjie Xia; Xiangdong Kong

Dizziness only occurred during nasal respiration. Inspection of the tympanic membrane on respiration indicated a patulous eustachian tube (PET). Video-oculography showed a slight nystagmus during nasal respiration. Placement of a tympanostomy tube 6 months after the start of symptoms immediately resolved the dizziness, and nystagmus during nasal respiration was reduced. A few days after treatment, the patient developed ocular fatigue and pain associated with eye movement, which was diagnosed as vestibular asthenopia. These symptoms were largely resolved by subsequent treatment with vestibulo-visual rehabilitation.

Using the miniscope imaging technique, we observed hyperactivity and abnormal connectivity of hippocampal neuronal ensembles 5xFAD mice. We further discovered that the function of the hippocampal neuronal circuits in 5xFAD mice was normalized by NDC-9009 intraperitoneal administration. NDC-9009 intraperitoneal administration also rescued memory defects in 5xFAD mice as quantified by the fear conditioning behavioral test and significantly reduced accumulation of amyloid plaques in hippocampal region of these mice. The obtained results support the potential utility of NDC-9009 and other SERCA PAMs as lead molecules for development of disease-modifying treatments for AD and potentially other neurodegenerative disorders.<b>Significance statement</b> Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a significant medical and social burden, yet no treatment currently exists. One of the hallmarks of AD is disrupted Ca²⁺ signaling, which contributes to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. In the current study, we demonstrate the potential of the SERCA pump positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) as promising disease-modifying agents. Through an <i>in vitro</i> screening, we identified NDC-9009 as the most effective SERCA PAM, promoting robust cytosolic calcium clearance and exhibiting neuroprotective properties. Furthermore, using miniature fluorescence in vivo imaging, a significant restoration of hippocampal neuronal ensembles activity and cognitive function after chronic administration of NDC-9009 in the transgenic AD mouse model was demonstrated<b>.</b>",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2025,Evgenii Gerasimov; Anastasiya Rakovskaya; Ekaterina Pchitskaya; Olga Vlasova; Russell Dahl; Ilya Bezprozvanny
40555516,Neural and Behavioral Markers of Negative Symptoms and Cognitive Impairment in Patients with Psychosis.,"Negative and cognitive symptoms impair functioning in patients with psychotic illnesses (i.e., schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SZ) and bipolar I disorder with psychotic features (BD)). Disruptions in mesocorticolimbic circuitry are hypothesized to underpin negative symptoms and cognitive impairment in patients with psychosis and may also facilitate reward-motivational deficits. In male and female patients with psychosis (N=44) and healthy controls (HC=27), we used neuroimaging to define gray matter morphology and white matter microstructure. We examined negative symptom severity with the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), effort allocation during reward processing with the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT), and cognitive performance with the MATRICS Cognitive Consensus Battery (MCCB). Reduced nucleus accumbens volumes in patients with psychosis were associated to higher CAINS total and Motivation and Pleasure subscale scores as well as lower effort expenditure for medium (50%) and high (88%) reward probability conditions during the EEfRT. The fornix showed reduced fractional anisotropy in patients with psychosis. Negative associations were present between CAINS Motivation and Pleasure subscores and MCCB composite and subscale scores. Lower gray matter volume in cerebellar lobule VI corresponded with impaired effort allocation during medium and high reward probability conditions and lower cognitive performance. However, lobule VI was not correlated with CAINS scores. While nucleus accumbens volume may serve as marker of negative symptoms in psychotic illnesses, cerebellar lobule VI morphology may inform on cognitive impairment in patients with SZ and BD. The nucleus accumbens and lobule VI may each contribute to reduced effort allocation during reward processing.<b>Significance Statement</b> Improving negative symptoms and cognitive impairment in SZ and BD remains an unmet clinical need. This study reveals that, in SZ and BD, structural changes in the nucleus accumbens and cerebellar lobule VI are associated with negative symptoms and cognitive impairments, respectively. The current findings also suggest that reductions in nucleus accumbens and cerebellar lobule VI volume may also underpin impaired reduced effort allocation during reward processing. This study provides impetus for further probing supratentorial and cerebellar circuitry to further understand negative and cognitive symptoms experienced by patients with psychotic illness and their associations with reward-motivational deficits.",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2025,Raquel van Gool; Mariesa Cay; Hanne van der Heijden; Emma Golden; Amanda Cao; Boyu Ren; Joseph Gonzalez-Heydrich; Ann K Shinn; Jaymin Upadhyay
40555507,Digital interventions for common mental health problems among older adults in low- and middle-income countries: a scoping review.,"The proportion of older adults is projected to rise dramatically in most parts of the world, and in 2050, 80% of all older adults (≥65 years) will reside in low- and middle-income countries. Developing digital interventions tailored to this population will be a crucial part in appropriately addressing the challenges associated with the upcoming demographic changes. The objective of this scoping review was to map all published research on digital interventions for common mental health problems among older adults conducted in low- and middle-income countries. We conducted a literature search in four databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Cochrane Library) and conducted hand searches of existing reviews and reference lists of included studies. Eligibility criteria were that (1) the study investigated or discussed digital interventions for common mental health problems (depression, anxiety, sleep problems and/or substance use problems), (2) the study concerned older adults (at least 60 years or older), (3) the study was conducted in a low- or middle-income country and (4) the study was published in English in a peer-reviewed academic journal. Two reviewers independently screened, reviewed and extracted data. Out of 1344 identified studies, 6 were included. The hand searches rendered no additional studies, leaving a total of six included studies. Four of these studies included quantitative data: of these, three were randomised controlled trials and one was a feasibility study. All focused on depression/loneliness and were published in middle-income countries (South Africa, Brazil and Turkey), and showed promising results in terms of reductions in social isolation and depression. In addition, two expert opinions had been published, both also conducted in a middle-income country (India). Despite the projected demographic transition, surprisingly little research appears to have been conducted on digital interventions for common mental health disorders among older adults in low- and middle-income countries. https://osf.io/bmdnv Open Science Framework.",BMJ global health,2025,Indranil Saha; Christopher Sundström; Arun Kandasamy; Martin Kraepelien; Neha Dayia; Asim Saha; Nitya Jayaram-Lindström; Amit Chakrabarti; Vivek Benegal
40555502,"Best practice for tobacco smoking policies within an acute substance use disorder care facility: considerations from a withdrawal management setting in British Columbia, Canada.","Smoking-related illness has historically been a major cause of death in persons with substance use disorders. Smoking cessation has the potential to support improved substance use disorder outcomes, as well as improved physical and mental health outcomes in persons receiving other substance use disorder treatment. However, tobacco abstinence-oriented policies within substance use disorder care settings may create barriers to clients who are uninterested in quitting smoking being able to access other potentially lifesaving substance use disorder treatment. In British Columbia, where the drug toxicity crisis has become the leading cause of unnatural death, reducing barriers to accessing substance use disorder treatment is a key public health priority. We present a <b>reflection on considerations from a withdrawal management setting</b> of a smoking policy change within that facility and review the potential benefits and harms of permissive smoking policies within substance use disorder care environments. Benefits include the elimination of a barrier to accessing other substance use treatment, patient autonomy over participation in smoking cessation treatment and the potential for less covert smoking and associated risks. Risks include ongoing physical and mental health harms of smoking, potentially poorer other substance use treatment outcomes, risks of tobacco relapse to other clients and secondhand smoke exposure to staff and other clients. Further research will be needed to explore the impacts of this policy change and evaluate the potential role for other smoking cessation innovations, including expansion of nicotine replacement options such as provision of nicotine electronic cigarette devices.",Tobacco control,2025,Natasha Caton; Mark Lysyshyn; Nicole Cowan; Evan Wood

40555492,[Analyzing the factors influencing speech recognition ability in patients with age-related hearing loss].,"<b>Objective:</b>To explore various factors influencing speech recognition ability in patients with age-related hearing loss（ARHL） and to investigate the correlation between speech recognition ability and cognitive function. <b>Methods:</b>This case-control study enrolled 150 ARHL patients（experimental group） and 132 normal-hearing controls. Participants underwent relevant assessments of auditory function, cognitive function, and tinnitus severity. Various statistical analyses were performed to evaluate the results. <b>Results:</b>①The PBmax and MoCA scores were significantly lower in the ARHL group compared to the control group（<i>P</i><0.05）. ②PBmax in the ARHL group was significantly influenced by multiple factors（<i>P</i><0.05）. ③Negative correlations were observed between PBmax in the ARHL group and age, degree of hearing loss, duration of the disease, duration of the worst hearing loss, smoking status, and tinnitus severity（<i>P</i><0.05）, while positive correlations were found between PBmax and education level, occupation type, frequency of verbal communication, and cognitive function level（<i>P</i><0.05）. ④Higher education level, frequent verbal communication, and high cognitive function level were protective factors for PBmax in ARHL patients（<i>P</i><0.05）, whereas the other factors were independent risk factors（<i>P</i><0.05）. ⑤A significant correlation was found between PBmax and MoCA scores in the ARHL group, and this correlation between cognitive function and speech recognition ability remained significant across different degrees of hearing loss（<0.05）. <b>Conclusion:</b>Speech recognition ability in ARHL patients is influenced by multiple factors.

Surgical repair was selected step by step using nasal septal mucosal flap with either the posterior septal artery or septal branch of the sphenopalatine artery as the pedicle, or a pedicled middle turbinate mucosal flap. All patients underwent ≥2-year endoscopic follow-up to assess flap viability and CSF leak recurrence. <b>Results:</b>The median postoperative hospital stay was 4 days. Five patients developed intracranial infections postoperatively. The follow-up period ranged from 2 to 12 years. Nasal endoscopic examinations showed good mucosal flap growth, with no recurrence of CSF leakage in any of the patients. <b>Conclusion:</b>High-flow cerebrospinal fluid（CSF） leaks following pituitary tumor surgery pose significant challenges for clinical repair. Based on intraoperative nasal septal mucosal preservation and the condition of sellar base CSF leakage, the ""three-step"" strategy for preparing autologous pedicled nasal mucosal flaps-utilizing posterior septal artery, ethmoidal artery-based, or pedicled middle turbinate mucosal flaps sequentially-is a safe and effective repair method.",Lin chuang er bi yan hou tou jing wai ke za zhi = Journal of clinical otorhinolaryngology head and neck surgery,2025,Shiyin Qin; Zhuohui Liu; Fengfeng Jia; Biao Ruan; Ruiqing Long
40555488,[Mechanisms of enhanced noise susceptibility in waardenburg syndrome <i>Sox10 p.S100Rfs*9</i> mutant mice].,"<b>Objective:</b>To investigate the impact of Waardenburg syndrome（WS） -associated <i>Sox10 p.S100Rfs*9</i> mutation on inner ear function and its mechanism in noise-induced hearing impairment. <b>Methods:</b>A mice model carrying the <i>Sox10 p.S100Rfs*9</i> mutation was established using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology. Auditory phenotypes were assessed under baseline conditions and after noise exposure（96 dB SPL, 2 hours）. Auditory brainstem response（ABR） tests were performed to evaluate hearing function, combined with immunofluorescence staining of cochlear basilar membrane whole-mounts to observe hair cells and ribbon synapses. Transcriptome sequencing was conducted to analyze molecular mechanisms. <b>Results:</b><i>Sox10 p.S100Rfs*9</i> heterozygous mice exhibited normal hearing thresholds with characteristic ventral pigmentation abnormalities under baseline conditions. Following noise exposure, mutant mice showed significantly higher ABR thresholds at 24 000 Hz compared to wild-type controls（[60.00±6.12]vs[48.13±4.28]dB SPL, <i>P</i><0.000 1）, and a significant reduction in ribbon synapses（CtBP2-positive puncta） in the basal turn（[55.0±2.3]vs[64.8±3.3]per inner hair cell, <i>P</i>=0.006 6）, while hair cell morphology and number remained intact. Transcriptome analysis revealed altered expression of genes involved in immune regulation, membrane structures, ion channels, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions. <b>Conclusion:</b>The <i>Sox10 p.S100Rfs*9</i> mutation does not alter baseline hearing function but significantly increases inner ear susceptibility to noise damage, primarily manifested as enhanced ribbon synapse vulnerability, especially in high-frequency regions. This gene-environment interaction reveals that <i>Sox10</i> haploinsufficiency may compromise noise tolerance by affecting synaptic stability and inner ear protective mechanisms. These findings provide new perspectives on the phenotypic heterogeneity in WS patients and theoretical basis for individualized noise protection strategies for patients carrying SOX10 mutations.",Lin chuang er bi yan hou tou jing wai ke za zhi = Journal of clinical otorhinolaryngology head and neck surgery,2025,Yang Xiao; Li Li; Ken Lin; Dong Su; Yingqin Gao; Jing Ma; Tiesong Zhang

40555479,Associations between neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage and psychological distress among Australian adults: longitudinal analysis of the HILDA survey (2007-2021).,"Mental disorders contribute substantially to the global burden of disease. The neighbourhood socioeconomic environment is a key determinant of mental health, even after accounting for individual-level socioeconomic factors. However, few longitudinal studies have examined this relationship. This study examined longitudinal associations between neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage and psychological distress from three perspectives: overall associations, trends over time and changing neighbourhood exposures. Data were from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey wave 7 (2007) to wave 21 (2021), a nationally representative household-based cohort study, including 109 604 observations. Mental health was assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), analysed as a continuous variable, score range 10-50. Neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage was measured using derived spatially and temporally consistent census-based data, analysed in quintiles. Multilevel and fixed effects linear regression models were used. Psychological distress increased with neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage, with K10 scores 1.35 points higher (95% CI 1.14 to 1.55) in the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods compared with the least. However, the rate of change in distress over time did not vary by neighbourhood disadvantage. An association was observed between changes in disadvantage and changes in psychological distress for the most socioeconomically disadvantaged neighbourhoods. The findings from nationally representative longitudinal data show that individuals living in more disadvantaged neighbourhoods consistently experienced higher psychological distress compared with those in less disadvantaged neighbourhoods. These inequalities remained stable over time, and limited evidence of change suggests that the association may reflect persistent differences between individuals living in different neighbourhoods.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2025,Rebecca A Reid; Suzanne Mavoa; Julia Gilmartin-Thomas; Sarah Foster; Jerome N Rachele

40555472,Inhibition of spreading depolarizations by targeting GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and voltage-gated sodium channels improves neurological deficits in rats with traumatic brain injury.,"Spreading depolarizations (SDs) are frequently observed in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Current research on inhibiting SDs primarily focuses on single targets; however, the efficacy and safety of this approach remain controversial. Effects of a novel compound, CTMB, on both GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and voltage-regulated sodium channels (Na<sub>V</sub>s) was assessed by whole-cell patch-clamp experiments. Protection against mechanical scratch injury by CTMB or d-bicuculline, a competitive GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonist, was assessed using cultures of HT22 cells. In vivo, short- and long-term neurobehavioural performance of male Sprague-Dawley rats were evaluated following treatment with different doses of CTMB, 2 h after TBI. Western blots, RT-qPCR and immunohistochemical assays were used to explore mechanisms underlying the effects of CTMB. CTMB was an allosteric agonist at GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and inhibited Na<sub>V</sub>s, thereby increasing the threshold for SDs and potentially suppressing their initiation and propagation. During the subacute phase, CTMB restored the balance between excitation and inhibition, preventing neuron injury and loss by suppressing mitochondria-involved apoptosis. In the recovery phase, CTMB promoted synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus by activating the BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway. In TBI rats, CTMB enhanced neurological function, reducing epilepsy incidence and mortality, and prolonging survival times. Targeting both Na<sub>V</sub>s and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors can overcome limitations associated with single-target approaches, providing valuable insights and critical clues for drug discovery in TBI and offering a promising therapeutic strategy for other neurological disorders involving SDs, such as stroke and subarachnoid haemorrhage.",British journal of pharmacology,2025,Ruijie Yan; Qi Liu; Di Zhang; Kai Li; Yue Li; Yao Nie; Yingying Zhang; Pengyu Li; Shengjun Mao; Hui Li

A comprehensive analysis of MPS II (CAMPS II), integrating long-range PCR with long-read sequencing (LRS), was established to identify IDS variants in 92 patients with clinically suspected MPS II. Comparative analysis against conventional genetic testing including multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and Sanger sequencing revealed concordant results in 75% (69/92) of cases, with discordant results in 25% (23/92) of cases. Among 23 discordant cases, CAMPS II newly identified IDS variants in 18 patients and enhanced variant detection in five patients. The diagnostic yield of CAMPS II for pathogenic variants was 82.6% (76/92), significantly higher than 66.3% (61/92) with conventional methods. CAMPS II expanded the genotypic spectrum in 92 probands, including 79.3% (73/92) SNVs/Indels, 15.2% (14/92) IDS/IDSP1 inversions, 2.2% (2/92) complete IDS deletions, 2.2% (2/92) gross deletions/duplications, and 1.1% (1/92) IDS/IDSP1 deletions. Moreover, 14.1% (13/92) of the patients carried novel variants. Junction characterization in 15 patients with complex rearrangement revealed hotspot regions prone to inversion and conversion events.

40555455,Effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation on perioperative neurocognitive dysfunction: study protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.,"Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNDs), a common postoperative complication associated with anaesthesia and surgical procedures, are characterised by impairments in memory, attention, language comprehension and social functioning. Accumulating evidence from clinical studies indicates that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-a non-invasive neuromodulatory modality capable of targeted cortical stimulation-may offer therapeutic promise for PND management. To comprehensively assess the intervention efficacy and safety parameters of TMS in mitigating postoperative cognitive decline, we propose conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Our findings aim to provide evidence-based insights into the neuroprotective potential of TMS for mitigating cognitive decline in surgical populations. The investigation will implement a multifaceted search protocol encompassing international and Chinese scholarly resources. The search will be conducted in major databases, including Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, China Biology Medicine, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wan Fang Database and Chinese Scientific Journal Database from inception to 31 March 2025. To capture the latest research trends, ongoing trials will be simultaneously searched in the WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov and the China Clinical Trial Registry. Grey literature will be supplemented through resources such as GreyNet International, OpenGrey and Google Scholar. The inclusion criteria for this review are restricted to randomised controlled trials investigating the application of TMS as an intervention for PND. Primary endpoints comprise clinically confirmed incidence rates of postoperative delirium and delayed neurocognitive recovery. Two researchers will independently perform literature screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment. The risk of bias in included studies will be evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0. Evidence certainty will be appraised through the GRADE framework with explicit justification for downgrading decisions. Meta-analysis will be conducted using STATA V.15.1 statistical software. The data synthesis process will incorporate standardised methodologies, including heterogeneity testing, sensitivity analysis and assessment of publication bias. This study will not involve the collection of biometric information or medical privacy data throughout the research process, thus complying with the exemption criteria outlined in the 'Measures for Ethical Review of Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects.' The findings will adhere to academic standards and be submitted for publication in reputable international medical journals following a rigorous double-blind peer-review process.

40555449,Prevalence of autism among adults in Canada: results from a simulation modelling study.,"To estimate the prevalence of autism among adults living in Canada. A Monte Carlo simulation modelling approach was employed. Input parameters included adult population estimates and mortality rates; autism population all-cause mortality risk ratios; and autism prevalence estimates derived from child and youth data due to the lack of adult data. This approach was executed through 10 000 simulations, with each iteration generating a distinct data scenario. Prevalence estimates were reported as the mean with the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles, corresponding to a 95% simulation interval (SI). Where possible, Canadian data sources were used, including the 2019 Canadian Health Survey on Children and Youth and Statistics Canada mortality rates and population estimates. National prevalence estimates of autistic adults living in private dwellings in Canada, with variations in prevalence by sex at birth and province/territory considered. The findings suggest the prevalence of autism among adults in Canada to be 1.8% (95% SI 1.6%, 2.0%). National prevalence estimates by sex at birth were 0.7% (95% SI 0.6%, 0.9%) for females and 2.9% (95% SI 2.6%, 3.2%) for males. Provincial/territorial estimates ranged from 0.7% in Saskatchewan (95% SI 0.3%, 1.3%) to 3.6% in New Brunswick (95% SI 2.4%, 5.1%). The limited availability of data on autistic adults constrains our ability to fully understand and address their unique needs. In this study, autism prevalence was estimated based on diagnosed cases, which excludes individuals without a formal diagnosis. Additionally, other factors such as data availability and methodological assumptions may influence the modelling of prevalence estimates. As a result, our findings should be interpreted within the context of these limitations. Nevertheless, this study provides a valuable reference point for understanding autism prevalence among adults in Canada.",BMJ open,2025,Erin Collins; Rojiemiahd Edjoc; Amy Farrow; Christoffer Dharma; Stelios Georgiades; Kieran Holmes; Christa Orchard; Siobhan O'Donnell; Sarah Palmeter; Mackenzie Salt; Ahmed Al-Jaishi
40555446,Randomised trial of home sleep apnoea testing compared to in-lab polysomnography for the evaluation of obstructive sleep apnoea in children: rationale and study protocol.,"Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) affects 1-5% of the paediatric population, including 55-90% of children with Down syndrome (DS), and has been associated with negative effects on neurocognitive development, cardiovascular health, immune development and quality of life. In-lab attended polysomnography (PSG) is currently the gold standard for the diagnosis of OSA in children, but it poses challenges due to the burden on families and limited testing facilities. Home sleep apnoea testing (HSAT), an unattended sleep test done at home, is an accepted alternative for adults but lacks sufficient evidence to be used clinically for the evaluation of OSA in children. HSAT may be especially beneficial for children with DS or others with sensory issues or those who struggle with sleeping in a laboratory setting overnight. This single-centre trial compares HSAT to PSG for the diagnosis of OSA in children, including those with DS. The trial will enrol 317 children 5-12 years old, including approximately 100 with DS. The primary outcome is the diagnostic accuracy of HSAT compared with PSG for OSA evaluated through ROC. Secondary outcomes include the agreement between HSAT and PSG for therapeutic decision-making and comparison of preference and acceptability of HSAT versus PSG. This trial seeks to evaluate HSAT as an alternative diagnostic tool for paediatric OSA, potentially expanding testing options for clinicians and families.

40555444,"Treatment outcomes, medication adherence and predictors among patients with epilepsy in Mekelle City Hospitals, Ethiopia: a multicentre observational cross-sectional study.","This study aimed to assess treatment outcome, medication adherence and predictors among epilepsy patients at three low-resource setting hospitals in Mekelle City, Northern Ethiopia. A multicentre hospital-based observational cross-sectional study was conducted. The study was conducted in three resource-limited tertiary care hospitals in Mekelle City, Northern Ethiopia: Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Mekelle General Hospital and Quiha General Hospital. A total of 351 patients with epilepsy receiving regular follow-up care at adult neurology outpatient clinics in three low-resource setting hospitals were included in the study. The study assessed adherence to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), treatment outcomes and identified independent predictors of these outcomes. A total of 351 study participants were included in the final analysis, with a mean (±SD) age of 37.98±14.27 years. More than one-third (39%) had poorly controlled seizures.

More than two-thirds of patients with epilepsy experienced poor seizure control. Place of residence, employment status and the number of seizure episodes prior to treatment initiation were identified as significant predictors of treatment outcomes. Approximately half of the study participants were adherent to their medications, with employment status, the presence of seizure-triggering factors, comorbidities and seizure control serving as predictors of medication adherence.",BMJ open,2025,Gebremicheal Gebreyohanns Kahsay; Kidu Gidey; Alemseged Beyene Berha
40555440,"Prognostic nutritional index in the prediction of adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Urumqi, China: a retrospective cohort study.","Prognostic nutritional index (PNI) is an index for assessing nutritional and immune status. The aim of this study is to investigate the predictive value of PNI for long-term major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This retrospective cohort study analysed 1582 STEMI patients with T2DM who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention from January 2015 to June 2023 in Urumqi, China. Patients were followed up for MACCE. The primary endpoint was new-onset MACCE including all-cause death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. This study ultimately included 1582 patients for analysis with a median follow-up period of 48 months (IQR: 24-84 months) and 282 patients (17.8%) developed MACCE. Of them, 138 (8.7%), 84 (5.3%) and 60 (3.8%) patients developed all-cause death, a non-fatal MI and a non-fatal stroke, respectively. Incidences of MACCE and all-cause death conversely correlated with PNI. Kaplan-Meier curves showed a significant difference in all components of MACCE between PNI quartiles (p<0.001). The multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that PNI was an independent predictor of MACCE (adjusted HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.93 to 0.97, p<0.001) and all-cause death (adjusted HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.97, p<0.001). The optimal PNI cut-off for predicting MACCE and all-cause death was 45.10 and 45.09, respectively. Moreover, the addition of PNI to the traditional prognostic model for MACCE improved the C-statistic value (p<0.001). PNI, a simple and easily obtainable index, was independently associated with MACCE and all-cause death in this study. Lower PNI levels were significantly linked to an increased risk of long-term MACCE, especially in male, elderly patients and those with higher glycosylated haemoglobin and low- density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.",BMJ open,2025,Bang-Hao Zhao; Teng Yuan; Ling Zhao; Amanguli Ruze; Qiu-Lin Li; An-Xia Deng; Su Hu; Xiao-Ming Gao
40555407,Usability of Behavioural Recording Application (BRA) for Coping With Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia.,"This study developed the Behavior Recording Application (BRA) based on Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) to support non-pharmacological interventions for Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD), and examined its usability among care professionals. Thirty-one care staff members from elderly care facilities in Japan used the application during ABA-based consultations and evaluated its usability using a 10-item Likert scale. While overall ease of use was rated positively, differences were observed in participants' willingness to use it regularly and in their perception of how much they needed to learn to use it effectively. Stepwise multiple regression analysis using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) identified age, caregiving experience, and digital device usage as significant predictors of usability. These findings suggest that although BRA demonstrates good usability, additional support may be necessary for care professionals of advanced age, with less experience, or with limited digital proficiency.",Psychogeriatrics : the official journal of the Japanese Psychogeriatric Society,2025,Ai Ishikawa; Eiji Onchi; Katsuo Yamanaka
40555246,Different patterns of brain iron deposition exist in peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients with cognitive impairment.,"The incidence of cognitive impairment in patients with peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) has been increased, but the specific mechanism is not clear. Disruption of iron homeostasis is associated with cognitive impairment. This study aimed to explore the relationship between brain iron deposition and cognitive impairment in patients with PD and HD by using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). The cross-sectional study enrolled 56 PD patients, 66 HD patients, and 56 age-sex matched healthy controls. All participants underwent QSM to measure brain iron content and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to assess cognitive function. In addition, relevant biochemical indicators were collected and analyzed. The ANOVA was used to test for differences in susceptibility value among bilateral caudate nuclei (CAU), thalamus (THA), putamen and pallidum. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to investigate the relationships between susceptibility value and clinical laboratory parameters or MoCA score. Compared with HC, PD patients showed higher susceptibility value in bilateral CAU and left THA. Compared with HD patients, PD patients showed higher susceptibility value in left THA. PD patients showed a negative correlation between susceptibility value and MoCA score. There are different patterns of brain iron deposition in PD and HD patients. Abnormal brain iron deposition in PD patients may be associated with cognitive impairment.",Renal failure,2025,Jiamin Liu; Wenbo Yang; Lijun Song; Xianjin Chen; Xiayan Yin; Mingan Li; Xiaoyan Bai; Zhenghan Yang; Zhenchang Wang; Weikang Guo; Hao Wang; Gang Wang
40555137,NOVA1/2 genes and alternative splicing in neurodevelopment.,"NOVA1 and NOVA2 are neuron-specific RNA-binding proteins essential for alternative splicing (AS), influencing neurodevelopment by regulating transcript diversity. These proteins recognize YCAY sequences on pre-mRNA, regulating exon inclusion or skipping, intron retention, and alternative polyadenylation. Despite their 75% sequence identity, NOVA1 and NOVA2 exhibit distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns and target specificities, with NOVA2 predominantly expressed in cortical regions and NOVA1 in the cerebellum and spinal cord. De novo truncating variants in NOVA2 are responsible for a severe neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD), characterized by intellectual developmental disorder, motor delay, autistic features, and corpus callosum hypoplasia. Loss of Nova2 in animal models results in brain development anomalies, such as corpus callosum agenesis in mice, which mirrors the human neurodevelopmental phenotype. If direct evidence remains limited, emerging data suggest that mutations in NOVA1 might also be involved in neurological disorders. The contribution of other mRNA-binding proteins to NDD further underscores the critical role of regulation of RNA processing in neurodevelopment. This review explores the diverse functions of NOVA proteins, their impact on AS during brain development, and their implications in brain disorders.",Current opinion in genetics & development,2025,Amélie Piton
40555085,Multiorgan involvement and genetic spectrum of 20 Chinese patients with PMM2-CDG.,"The most common congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) is the phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2) deficiency (PMM2-CDG). PMM2-CDG is a complex genetic disorder that often found in infancy or early childhood with a clinically heterogeneous variety of neurological and non- neurological symptoms. To expand the phenotypic and genetic spectrum of PMM2-CDG, we summarized the characteristics of 20 Chinese patients. All patients were diagnosed by genetic analysis. Clinical characteristics, genotypes, imaging, electrophysiological, and metabolic data were analyzed retrospectively. Twelve males and eight females with PMM2-CDG were included. The median age at diagnosis was 12.0 (ranging from 6.0 to 52.0) months, while the median age at final follow-up was 10.3 (ranging from 5.1 to 12.8) years. All patients exhibited multisystem symptoms and various neurological symptoms were observed. Developmental delay was the primary initial symptoms. Dystaxia, growth retardation and liver damage were also common phenotypes. Cerebellar atrophy was the characteristic abnormality on brain imaging. Fourteen variants of the PMM2 gene were identified, of which five, c.82A > G (p.M28V), c.551C > T (p. P184L), c.640G > T (p.G214C), c.656A > T (p.E219V) and c.712C > G (p.R238G), were newly reported. The most prevalent variant was c.430 T > C (p.F144L), which was identified in 65.0 % of patients, followed by c.395 T > C (p.I132T). Consistent with reports from other populations, missense variants constituted the predominant type of PMM2 gene alterations. PMM2-CDG presents as a multi-system disease with diverse clinical phenotypes, posing challenges to early identification and diagnosis. The most common pathogenic variant in this Chinese cohort was c.430 T > C (p.F144L), which is close to, but different from, the common pathogenic variant c.422G > A (p.R141H) among European PMM2-CDG patients.",Molecular genetics and metabolism,2025,Huiting Zhang; Jingtao Zhang; Weimeng Ma; Xue Ma; Ruxuan He; Yuan Ding; Yupeng Liu; Wenyue Zhang; Hui Dong; Yao Zhang; Miao He; Yanling Yang
40555083,Multivariate neural markers of individual differences in thought control difficulties.,"This study identified specific patterns of brain activity distributed within and across four different brain networks associated with an individual's difficulties in controlling thoughts, a transdiagnostic feature of mental health disorders. Previously, we demonstrated that four working memory control operations-maintaining, replacing, suppressing, and clearing thoughts-are represented by distinct multi-voxel patterns of brain activation. Moreover, the exact pattern that characterizes these operations is distinct across four sets of brain regions, referred to as working memory operation networks, that include a Visual Network (VN), Somatomotor Network (SMN), Default Mode Network (DMN), and Frontoparietal Control Network (FPCN). The current study examined the hypothesis that aspects of these multi-voxel patterns are associated with an individual's difficulty in controlling thoughts, as derived from a composite of three self-report questionnaires, in a non-clinical (N = 48) sample. Consistent with our hypothesis, three effects were observed. Individuals with higher levels of thought-control difficulty have less distinct multi-voxel patterns for each of the four operations, have a less distinct representation of the suppression and clear operations in the DMN network from its representations in other networks, and have a more variable representation of multiple operations within each of the FPCN, VN and SMN networks. These neural patterns accounted for over 30 % of the variance in self-reported thought difficulties. Moreover, these associations were specific to working memory operations as they were not observed at rest, highlighting their relevance for understanding the neural mechanisms of repetitive negative thinking and their potential as biomarkers for interventions targeting impaired thought control.",NeuroImage.

40555077,"Differences in conditioning using unconditioned stimuli evoking fear, disgust or both emotions simultaneously.","Understanding differences in conditioning with stimuli evoking fear and/or disgust is valuable to develop meaningful interventions for phobias, anxiety disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD). We investigated possible differences in the acquisition and extinction of conditioned responses using unconditioned stimuli (UCS) which elicit fear, disgust, or both emotions simultaneously. Participants underwent a sequential conditioning paradigm over three consecutive days (acquisition, extinction, and extinction retrieval) and were randomly assigned to fear (F), disgust (D), or mixed (FD) conditioning. Pictorial stimuli (UCS) and neutral faces (as conditioned stimuli; CS) were used, with CS-UCS contingency, valence, fear, and disgust ratings as readout measures. The D and FD groups showed higher valence and disgust ratings after acquisition than the F group, with no group differences in CS-UCS contingency or fear ratings. During extinction, the F group had the greatest reduction in CS-UCS contingency ratings, and the D group showed the largest decrease in disgust ratings for CS+. At extinction retrieval, disgust ratings decreased most in the D group, while fear ratings dropped most in the F and FD groups for CS-. No significant group differences were found for valence during extinction and extinction retrieval. Conditioning with UCS evoking disgust or disgust and fear simultaneously led to stronger negative valence and disgust responses compared to conditioning with fear-evoking stimuli. Extinction was most effective in the F group (highest reduction of CS-UCS contingency ratings), offering some support for the idea that disgust may be more resistant to extinction than fear.",Behaviour research and therapy,2025,Annalisa Lipp; Armin Zlomuzica
40555075,An anxiety screening framework integrating multimodal data and graph node correlation.,"Anxiety disorders are a significant global health concern, profoundly impacting patients' lives and social functioning while imposing considerable burdens on families and economies. However, current anxiety screening methods face limitations due to cost constraints and cognitive biases, particularly in their inability to deeply model correlations among multidimensional features. They often overlook crucial information inherent in their internal couplings, limiting their accuracy and applicability in clinical diagnostics. To address these challenges, we propose an advanced anxiety screening framework that integrates multimodal data, such as physiological, behavioral, audio, and textual, using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). While our framework draws upon existing technologies such as GCN, one-dimensional convolutional neural networks, and gated recurrent units, the uniqueness of our framework lies in how these components are combined to capture complex spatiotemporal relationships and correlations among multimodal features. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's robust performance, achieving an accuracy of 93.48%, Area Under Curve of 94.58%, precision of 90.00%, sensitivity of 81.82%, specificity of 97.14%, F1 score of 85.71%. Notably, the method remains effective even when questionnaire data is unavailable, underscoring its practicality and reliability. This anxiety screening approach provides a new perspective for early identification and intervention of anxiety symptoms, offering a scientific basis for personalized treatment and prevention through the analysis of multimodal data and graph structures.",Artificial intelligence in medicine,2025,Haimiao Mo; Hongjia Wu; Qian Rong; Zhijian Hu; Meng Yi; Peipei Chen
40555059,Clinical insights into the mechanisms of infectious microbes and microbiota in chronic neurologic and psychiatric diseases.,"Chronic neurologic and psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia, depression, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's are increasingly linked to infectious microorganisms and gut microbiota. This review explores how pathogenic microorganisms and microbial communities impact neuropsychiatric, neurodegenerative, and neuroinflammatory processes, highlighting the gut-brain axis' crucial communication network in influencing behavior and brain function. Infectious agents like bacteria, viruses, and fungi cause disease by causing neurotoxic reactions, disrupting the blood-brain barrier, and activating neuroinflammatory cascades. Gut dysbiosis impacts immunological homeostasis and neural transmission by altering the synthesis of metabolites from microorganisms, such as short-chain fatty acids and neurotransmitter precursors. Neurodegeneration and psychiatric diseases are influenced by molecular mechanisms such as toll-like receptor signaling, microglial activation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. This review highlights the potential of microbiota-targeted treatments such as probiotics, prebiotics, and microbiome transplantation as novel treatments for chronic diseases. Understanding the intricate interactions between infectious microorganisms, microbiota, and the central nervous system enables the formation of precision medicine strategies to challenge the rising incidence of neurologic and psychiatric diseases. Future research should explore causal relationships and identify specific microbial biomarkers to enhance early diagnosis, prevention, and personalized treatment plans.","Pathology, research and practice",2025,Md Faysal; Mehrukh Zehravi; Md Al Amin; Safia Obaidur Rab; Patibandla Jahnavi; Uppuluri Varuna Naga Venkata Arjun; Jeetendra Kumar Gupta; Abdul Ajeed Mohathasim Billah; Rajeshwar Vodeti; P Dharani Prasad; Sultan Saeed Sultan Aseri; Falak A Siddiqui; Talha Bin Emran
40554975,LG-TriCapsNet: A lightweight graph capsule framework with nearest neighbor graphs for multi-disease EEG classification.,"EEG signal classification for neurological disorders is a very critical task in the healthcare field, demanding accuracy and efficiency. Due to the diversity of these disorders and the complexity of the EEG signals, the task of diagnosing these disorders is very challenging. Traditional methods usually cannot capture the intricate relationships between temporal and spatial features, which are inherent in EEG data. To overcome this challenge, the proposed Lightweight Graph Triplet Capsule Networks combined with Nearest Neighbor Graphs effectively leverage both temporal and spatial information in EEG signals. The graph-based representation enhances the spread of information across the network, which thus performs efficient feature extraction and good classification performance. By integrating NNG, the model dynamically captures spatial-temporal dependencies between EEG channels, significantly improving feature discrimination across neurological conditions. The novelty of the approach lies in the combination of graph structures and capsule networks, which particularly makes it suited for handling the complexities of EEG data. LG-TriCapsNet is performing quite well as the F1 score is 98.32 %, accuracy is 98.34 %, sensitivity is 98.30 %, and specificity is 98.40 %, and it also outperforms the current state-of-the-art models, which points to the fact that this framework is really effective for the classification of such a variety of neurological disorders. LG-TriCapsNet, by providing a computationally efficient, real-time solution, holds great potential for advancing clinical decision-making and patient care by offering a robust tool for automated neurological disease detection and diagnosis. At https://github.com/jainshraddha12/LG-TriCapsNet, the source code will be available to the public.",Computers in biology and medicine,2025,Shraddha Jain; Rajeev Srivastava
40554955,Functional food lycopene mitigates obesity-related cognitive decline via lipid metabolism regulation and neuroprotection via taurine and glutathione pathway.,"Obesity has emerged as a critical global public health challenge, contributing not only to metabolic disorders but also to neurological complications, including cognitive decline. Lycopene, a carotenoid found abundantly in tomatoes, has gained attention as a functional food due to its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study explores the neuroprotective effects of lycopene against obesity-related cognitive impairment in male C57BL/6 mice. Mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for four months to induce obesity, followed by supplementation with lycopene (50 mg/kg). Cognitive performance was assessed through Y-maze, Morris water maze, and novel object recognition tests. We also examined systemic and hippocampal inflammatory markers, along with lipidomic and proteomic profiles. Lycopene supplementation significantly improved cognitive function, restored neuronal density, and enhanced levels of key neuroprotective proteins, including BDNF and NeuN. Lipidomic analysis revealed a reduction in pro-inflammatory lipids (e.g., lysophosphatidylcholine, triglycerides) and an increase in neuroprotective lipids (e.g., phosphatidylserine, fatty acids). Additionally, proteomic data showed a decrease in lipid-induced neurotoxic proteins and an upregulation of pathways associated with taurine and glutathione metabolism, promoting neuronal stability and plasticity. These results suggest that lycopene exerts neuroprotective effects by restoring lipid balance and modulating amino acid signaling pathways, thereby alleviating cognitive decline in obese mice. This study highlights lycopene's potential as a functional dietary ingredient to combat obesity-related neurological disorders and provides novel insights into the development of food-based strategies to improve both metabolic health and cognitive function.","Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2025,Yuqing Wu; Jingfang Liu
40554893,Xiaoer Huanglong pellets remodels the periphery microenvironment to improve attention deficit hyperactivity disorder based on the microbiota-gut-brain axis.,"Recently, research interest in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has grown significantly, driven by its increasing incidence and substantial societal impact. Among the various pathogenic mechanisms under investigation, the microbiota-gut-brain axis has emerged as a crucial area of focus. In the context of ADHD treatment, Xiaoer Huanglong Pellets (XRHLP), a traditional Chinese herbal formulation, have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy, although the underlying mechanisms remain partially understood. This study aimed to analyze and compare the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of XRHLP, including gastric release (WR_HL), enteric release (CR_HL), and colon release (JCR_HL) pellets, for ADHD treatment. This study employed a multi-modal approach to investigate the effects of XRHLP on ADHD. Behavioral assessments combined with Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western-blot analyses were conducted to evaluate the therapeutic outcomes in model rats with ADHD. Comprehensive profiling of the gut-brain axis was performed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and untargeted and targeted metabolomic analyses. The causal role of the gut microbiota was further validated using fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). WR_HL, CR_HL, and JCR_HL improved ADHD-like behaviors and neurotransmission dysfunction, with JCR_HL exhibiting superior intervention effects compared to WR_HL and CR_HL. These therapeutic effects are mediated through multiple pathways, including the restoration of gut microbial homeostasis, attenuation of inflammatory cascades, and repair of compromised intestinal and blood-brain barrier. The intervention also corrected systemic metabolic imbalances by specifically addressing the abnormalities in amino acid metabolism, neurotransmitter regulation, and short-chain fatty acid production. FMT experiments further confirmed the critical role of microbial modulation in mediating the behavioral and microbial regulatory effects of XRHLP. In summary, XRHLP exerts anti-ADHD effects by improving the microbiota-gut-brain axis and correcting amino acid metabolic disorders, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which traditional Chinese medicine influences ADHD and offers potential avenues for drug development.",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2025,Longtai You; Hulinyue Peng; Jing Liu; Na Sai; Wenwen Zhao; Xiao Li; Chunjing Yang; Peng Guo; Jian Ni
40554870,Exploring applications of electrically evoked compound action potentials using the vestibulo-cochlear implant.,"Vestibulo-cochlear implants are a potential treatment approach for patients with loss of vestibular function. A critical aspect is the development of reliable and objective outcome measures, to assess their efficacy and optimize their performance. As in cochlear implant care and other neural prostheses, electrically evoked compound action potentials (eCAP) can be used to measure the neural response to implant stimulation. eCAPs might provide information about the presence and misalignment of the electrically evoked vestibulo-ocular reflex, and potential vestibulo-cochlear interactions. This could be valuable in intra-operative functionality assessment, as input for fitting, and to measure spread of excitation. This study aimed to explore the potential role of eCAPs in vestibulo-cochlear implant research. eCAPs were measured in ten subjects with a vestibulo-cochlear implant. Different configurations were used, i.e., trans-canal, vestibulo-cochlear and cochleo-vestibular. The predictive value of eCAPs was evaluated for four outcomes: presence of an electrically evoked vestibulo-ocular reflex (eVOR), degree of misalignment of the eVOR, auditory perception due to vestibular stimulation, and the prevalence of vestibular activation due to cochlear stimulation. The results demonstrated a high positive predictive value of the eCAP for the presence of an eVOR (i.e., 1.0), while the negative predictive value was low (i.e., 0.54). The presence of trans-canal eCAP did not correspond with the degree of misalignment in the eVOR. Furthermore, the predictive values for auditory perception were low (i.e., ≤0.5). eCAP recordings in the cochlea to vestibular configuration imply a high likelihood of cochlear to vestibular interaction (i.e., 67% of electrodes). The presence of a vestibular eCAP was demonstrated to be a predictor of the presence of the eVOR. However, the low negative predictive value prevents the eCAP from providing a reliable indicator for intra-operative electrode position evaluation. eCAP measurements in vestibulo-cochlear configurations indicated that spread of excitation between the cochlea and canals is already possible at stimulation levels within the clinical fitting range of both the vestibular and cochlear electrodes. Measured eCAPs did not correspond with misalignment of the eVOR or the presence of an auditory percept as result of vestibular stimulation. Future research is needed to elucidate the full potential of vestibulo-cochlear implant eCAP measurements.",Hearing research,2025,Stan C J van Boxel; Bernd L Vermorken; Benjamin Volpe; Nils Guinand; Angélica Perez-Fornos; Elke M J Devocht; Raymond van de Berg
40554822,A repertoire and critical review of international resources relevant to medical assistance in dying where a mental disorder is the sole underlying medical condition.,"The possibility of asking for help in ending one's life is at the heart of some of the most enduring debates in medicine and bioethics. As a growing number of countries open to the practice, many concerns are emerging internationally about medical assistance in dying where a mental disorder is the sole underlying medical condition (MAiD-MD). It is paramount to understand what academic literature and resources are available to support different stakeholders in the context of MAiD-MD. This review aims to specifically identify various resources related to MAiD-MD and to initiate a process of compiling international resources to raise awareness about certain resources and support stakeholders to develop new resources. This review of resources adopted a methodology inspired by the work of Arksey and O'Malley (2005) and Levac et al. (2010)'s scoping studies, as well as more structured forms of thematic literature reviews for content extraction. 165 resources related directly or indirectly to MAiD-MD were identified and grouped according to the following six categories: 1) Laws, judgments, decisions, and reports from the operationalization of laws; 2) Ethical and clinical guidelines, protocols, practice guides, and information for healthcare professionals; 3) Resource directories; 4) Resources for sharing experiences, discussions, support or training; 5) Written resources for MAiD applicants, their relatives or the population; 6) Resources to support reflections and guide the development of practices. Twenty main relevant themes were identified through the thematic analysis. These themes are addressed and explored in varying degrees of depth throughout different resources. A diversity of relevant resources is developed internationally, but these are sometimes dispersed, little known, or inaccessible to the public. Numerous resources are developed to inform the various stakeholders and train healthcare professionals, but there seems to be a need to develop advanced support resources to help the various stakeholders in the context of MAiD-MD.",International journal of law and psychiatry,2025,Caroline Favron-Godbout; Izadora Foster; Eric Racine
40554800,Pursuit of Digital Innovation in Psychiatric Data Handling Practices in Ireland: Comprehensive Case Study.,"Ireland is ranked among the most disadvantageous European countries in terms of mental health challenges. Contrary to general health services that primarily focus on diagnosis and treatment, the mental health sector in Ireland deals with highly sensitive psychiatric case notes based on patient-doctor conversations. Such data, therefore, must be collected, analyzed, and stored with an approach customized specifically for psychiatry. This study's objective involves examining the state of data handling practices in the Irish Mental Health Services (MHS), identifying the shortcomings regarding privacy, security, and usability of psychiatric case notes, and proposing an innovative technological solution that addresses most of the surfaced challenges. The study was conducted using a comprehensive methodology. Our approach involved a thorough literature review, ethics approval, web-based surveys with mental health professionals as participants, interviews of psychiatrists, interactions with mental health organizations, analysis of inspection reports by the Ireland Mental Health Commission, and comparative evaluation of existing IT solutions. The thoroughness of our adopted research methodology instills confidence in the reliability and validity of our findings. Our study revealed outdated data management, heavy reliance on paperwork resulting in serious repercussions, parallel workload, alarmingly low readability of notes, and a nonviable setup that hinders research and analytical examination. Our survey reported an average score of 4.37 of 10 (SD 1.25) given by participants in terms of technology use. Regarding privacy measures, 75% (n=12) of participants mentioned that staff members are allowed to keep their phones while accessing psychiatric case notes. Similarly, 80% (n=13) of submissions highlighted that multiple staff members can access sensitive notes and patients' contact information. On the other hand, Mental Health Commission reports showed that their inspections are limited to evaluating physical privacy only. Regarding technological comparative analysis, we observed that conventional IT solutions are vulnerable against cyberattacks and fall short in addressing multiple challenges simultaneously. Therefore, an innovative convergence of different technologies is needed. Our research supports speech-to-text transcription for data collection, interactive artificial intelligence for data analysis, and permissioned blockchain for data storage and retrieval. Our survey participants also estimated the proposed solution to optimize their workload by an average of 35%. Irish MHS seem to be handling psychiatric data under polycrisis circumstances; therefore, a single-dimensional digitization of records would not be sufficient in addressing the wide range of concerns. In addition to highlighting intertwined challenges in Irish psychiatry and validating the need for innovation in data handling practices in Irish MHS, this study culminated in the proposal of an innovative technological solution that offers a significant contribution to a considerably improved, efficient, and compliant service delivery in mental health care.",JMIR human factors,2025,Rana Zeeshan; John Bogue; Amna Gill; Mamoona Naveed Asghar
40554785,Factors Related to Depressive Symptoms in People with Gambling Disorder.,"Gambling disorders may be associated with mental health issues, such as depressive disorders, as well as poor overall health and specific medical conditions. This study was a case-control study that compared a group with depressive symptoms (<i>n</i> = 33) to a group without depressive symptoms (<i>n</i> = 33), aiming to explore the relationship between factors associated with depressive symptoms. The group with depressive symptoms had shorter weekly exercise time and higher problem gambling severity and physical symptom scores than the group without depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms were associated with increased levels of problem gambling severity and physical symptoms. In the group with depressive symptoms, a decrease in the severity of problem gambling was associated with an increase in problem drinking. Although serotonin levels did not differ between the two groups based on depressive symptoms, serotonin levels were correlated with changes in appetite in the depressive symptom group. The lower the serotonin levels in the group with depressive symptoms, the greater the tendency to borrow money or sell personal belongings to fund gambling activities. Problem gambling severity had a greater impact on depressive symptoms than on physical symptoms. The results showed that gambling severity and physical symptoms were related to depressive symptoms in individuals with gambling disorders.",Issues in mental health nursing,2025,Jong Min Choi; Eun Jin Lee
40554780,Video- Versus Text-Based Psychoeducation in Web-Based E-Mental Health Programs: Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Mental health disorders affect 1 in 8 people worldwide, yet many face barriers to accessing care. E-mental health interventions, including self-guided internet-based programs, offer promising solutions. However, the mechanisms driving knowledge gain in such programs remain poorly understood. The role of medium, topic, sequence, and confidence and their interaction in learning outcomes need further investigation. Additionally, the influence of knowledge gaps on the outcome of psychoeducational intervention is not well understood (eg, whether psychoeducation requires an existing knowledge gap to be effective). This randomized controlled trial investigated the role of medium, topic, sequence, and participants' initial knowledge levels on knowledge gain and confidence in fully automated self-guided e-mental health psychoeducation. A total of 158 adults (mean age 34, SD 12.4 years; n=118, 74.7% female) were randomized to 8 experimental conditions (receiving video, texts, or both containing psychoeducational content on sleep or social competence; n=142) or a control group (neutral video; n=16). The fully automated interventions (videos) were developed for use in web-based e-mental health interventions. They address transdiagnostic symptoms and hence are relevant across various disorders. To assess the added value of video production for knowledge gain, text-based scripts corresponding to the video content were created and compared. All interventions and outcome assessments were delivered on the web via Qualtrics without face-to-face components. Pre- and postintervention knowledge was assessed using a validated 30-item knowledge test (true/false). Confidence in responses was rated on a 0% to 100% scale. Statistical analyses included 3-way ANOVA and multivariate ANOVA. Knowledge significantly increased across experimental groups (F<sub>1,156</sub>=17.272; P<.001; η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.10). Participants with social competence deficits had significantly lower baseline knowledge (P=.04; d=0.41). For sleep deficits, a nonsignificant trend emerged (P=.09; d=0.28). Participants with social competence deficits demonstrated greater knowledge improvement (t<sub>141</sub>=7.12; P<.001; d=0.60). Participants with sleep deficits showed smaller but significant gains (t<sub>141</sub>=2.43; P=.02; d=0.20). No significant differences in knowledge gain were found between video and text formats. Confidence in correct answers increased significantly in the experimental group (mean 42.82, 95% CI 41.15-44.50 to mean 51.67, 95% CI 49.28-54.04), with larger gains for social competence than sleep. Confidence in the control group remained unchanged. Both video and text formats effectively facilitated knowledge gain in e-mental health interventions, with no clear advantage of one medium over the other. Participants with prior deficits learned more in areas where they initially lacked knowledge. Confidence in correct answers increased alongside knowledge, highlighting psychoeducation's role in promoting self-efficacy.

40554722,Pyromania/ Firesetters and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in children and adolescents: a systematic review.,"The following article aims to explore the relationship between Pyromania/Firesetters and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in childhood and adolescence. A systematic literature review was carried out using search engines such as PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane, and Sicelo, to find relevant articles. Inclusion criteria included studies that related ADHD and Pyromania/Firesetters, while exclusion criteria included articles not related to the researched variables, articles from other systematic reviews, and articles not related to childhood and/or adolescence. Of the 71 articles initially identified, five met the eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis, which demonstrated that ADHD and Pyromania/Firesetters are comorbid conditions that can be diagnosed during childhood and/or adolescence. The comorbid relationship was observed to be more prevalent in boys, with an estimated prevalence of approximately 33%. Firesetting behavior was associated with a sixfold increase in the likelihood of boys being diagnosed with ADHD. Moreover, the comorbid relationship between ADHD and Pyromania/Firesetters was linked to conduct disorders and an elevated risk of future delinquent behavior. Mental health professionals should consider investigating firesetting history during the diagnostic assessment of ADHD, as the absence of early diagnosis and treatment increases the risk of adverse social outcomes. The study concluded that the results demonstrated the comorbid relationship between ADHD and Pyromania/Firesetters in childhood and adolescence, but more research is needed to better understand this relationship.",Trends in psychiatry and psychotherapy,2025,Rodolfo Teles de Melo; Laiana Quagliato
40554626,Characterization of the Pank2-/- mouse retinal phenotype as a pre-clinical model for pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration.,"Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) is an autosomal recessive movement and vision disorder in the neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation family of diseases. PKAN is caused by mutations in PANK2, encoding pantothenate kinase 2, causing an inborn error of coenzyme A metabolism and leading to iron accumulation in the basal ganglia. Peripheral pigmentary retinopathy is common in people with PKAN. The knockout murine model of the orthologous Pank2 gene is known to manifest retinal degeneration through electroretinography, pupillary response and histology analyses. Our longitudinal characterization of the retinopathy in this model reveals reduced visual performance and reduced photoreceptor thickness compared to wild-type mice. Additionally, retinal perturbations in coenzyme A metabolism and dopamine metabolism pathways mimic those previously observed in the brain. These data extend the murine ocular phenotype associated with loss of function of Pank2. With a measurable behavioral, structural and mechanistic retinal phenotype, this mouse model is an ideal pre-clinical model that can be used to evaluate therapeutics for PKAN.",PloS one,2025,Grace Li-Na Su; Suh Young Jeong; Dahlia Wafai; Wayne Tschetter; Dolly Zhen; Susan J Hayflick; Renee C Ryals
40554606,"Global, regional, and national burden of meningitis among children, 1990-2021: An analysis of the global burden of disease study 2021.","Childhood meningitis remains a serious and life-threatening infectious disease with considerable risk of long-term sequelae. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the global burden and temporal trends of childhood meningitis from 1990 to 2021. We extracted data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2021 to estimate incident cases, incidence rates, deaths, and mortality rates of childhood meningitis at global, regional, and national levels. We further assessed the etiological composition of childhood meningitis across different age groups and sociodemographic index (SDI) regions. Additionally, cross-country inequality analyses were conducted to measure the distributional inequality of childhood meningitis burden across countries. In 2021, childhood meningitis accounted for approximately 1.33 million incident cases and 112,000 deaths worldwide. The global incidence rate of childhood meningitis decreased by 59.8%, from 164.80 per 100,000 in 1990 to 66.24 per 100,000 in 2021. The global mortality rate also decreased by 69.18%, from 18.12 per 100,000 in 1990 to 5.59 per 100,000 in 2021. In 2021, the top three etiologies responsible for global childhood meningitis deaths were Streptococcus pneumoniae (17.01%), Neisseria meningitidis (14.03%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.11%). Notably, the leading etiologies of neonatal meningitis deaths were Group B Streptococcus (22.70%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.97%), and viral etiologies (15.35%). Cross-country inequality analysis revealed that low SDI regions bore a disproportionate burden. Despite significant progress over the past three decades, childhood meningitis remains a major public health challenge, particularly in resource-limited settings. Concerted efforts are required to reduce the unacceptable health inequities associated with this devastating disease.",PloS one,2025,Jun Li; Xiang Li; Shunhong Luo; Haishen Zhou
40554578,Prevalence of vision impairment among patients with diabetes mellitus in sub-Saharan Africa: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Diabetes mellitus is a growing global public health challenge, especially in low- and middle-income regions like sub-Saharan Africa, where healthcare resources are often limited. One of its most debilitating complications is vision impairment, which significantly impacts the quality of life, productivity, and independence of individuals. Although several studies have assessed the prevalence of vision impairment among individuals with diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa, their findings have been inconsistent and fragmented across different areas. A comprehensive synthesis of this evidence is crucial for informing healthcare planning, early screening, and management strategies. This study aimed to systematically review and synthesize the existing evidence on the prevalence of vision impairment among patients with diabetes mellitus in the region. A literature exploration was done in an electronic database such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Hinary, and African Journals Online. We included all observational studies reporting the prevalence of vision loss among diabetes mellitus patients in Sub-Saharan Africa. A random-effect meta-analysis model was computed to estimate the pooled prevalence of vision impairment. I2 test and Cochrane Q test statistics were used to assess the heterogeneity of the studies. Subgroup analysis was done based on the countries where the research was conducted. STATA Version 16 statistical software was used for data analysis. Publication bias was examined by funnel plots and Egger's tests. Only 26 studies with 12508 participants, contributing data from 14 countries within Sub-Saharan Africa, met the inclusion criteria for the final analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of visual impairment was found to be 29% (95% CI: 22%-35%). Heterogeneity was observed among included studies (p < 0.001 for high I2 values). Subgroup analysis revealed the source of heterogeneity in the studies carried out in Ethiopia (I2 = 99.2%, p = < 0.001), Nigeria (I2 = 94.59%, p = < 0.001), and Zambia (I2 = 77.34%, p = 0.036). The findings of this study indicated that the pooled prevalence of vision impairment among diabetes mellitus patients is relatively higher. It can be concluded that diabetes mellitus patients should be managed properly to prevent visual impairment. Early detection of visual impairment through screening and regular follow-up is recommended to reduce as well as control the burden of visual impairment and its impact on the diabetic population.",PloS one,2025,Altaseb Beyene Kassaw; Addis Alem Hadigu; Melese Shenkut Abebe; Amare Abera Tareke; Wondwossen Debebe; Gosa Mankelkl; Natnael Kebede; Alemu Gedefie
40554536,"The Healthy Brain 9 (HB9): A new instrument to characterize subjective cognitive decline, and detect anosognosia in mild cognitive impairment.","Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) affects 10% of older adults and may be a risk factor for future mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Some individuals with MCI have anosognosia, the denial or lack of awareness of their cognitive deficits. We developed and tested the Healthy Brain 9 (HB9), a self-reported assessment of cognitive performance and everyday functioning, in a diverse community-based cohort of older adults in South Florida. Cross-sectional study. Community-based longitudinal study of brain health. A total of 344 participants (mean age of 68.5±9.3y, 70% were female, 62% with 16 or less years of education, 39% ethnoracial minorities) completed the study. The sample included 42% normal cognition, 27% SCD and 30% MCI. Within the MCI group, 62% demonstrated awareness of cognitive deficits and 38% had MCI with anosognosia. The psychometric properties of the HB9 were examined and the performance of the HB9 was compared to Gold Standard comprehensive clinical-cognitive-functional-behavioral evaluations and biomarkers evaluations from the Healthy Brain Initiative at the University of Miami. The HB9 had strong psychometric properties with a Cronbach α of 0.898 (95%CI: 0.882-0.913) and low floor and ceiling effects. The HB9 performed well across different sociodemographic groups. Lower HB9 scores were associated with greater resilience, better physical performance, and less physical frailty. Higher HB9 scores were associated with more comorbid medical conditions, more mood symptoms, lower resilience, and more functional impairment. A cut-off score of 4 on the HB9 provided a 15-fold ability to detect SCD in cognitively normal individuals, and a 14-fold ability to detect anosognosia in MCI. The use of the HB9 as an assessment of subjective cognitive complaints may help identify SCD for potential interventions and enrollment into clinical trials. The HB9 may also identify anosognosia which could lead to worse outcomes in MCI.",PloS one,2025,James E Galvin; Katherine C Almonte; Andrea Buehler; Yolene M Caicedo; Conor B Galvin; Willman Jimenez; Mahesh S Joshi; Nicole Mendez; Mary Lou A Riccio; Marcia I Walker; Michael J Kleiman
40554526,Identifying risks in dementia care: Insights from a qualitative study with clinical pharmacists.,"People with dementia experience complex healthcare needs. Clinical pharmacists play a crucial role in optimising medication management and ensuring patient safety within the primary care setting. However, little is known about the specific barriers and challenges they face when delivering dementia care. This study investigates the safety of dementia care in the community, focusing on the experiences of clinical pharmacists. A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with clinical pharmacists. Data analysis employed codebook thematic analysis, guided by the SEIPS 2.0 framework. Thirteen clinical pharmacists were interviewed. Key risks include variations in pharmacist expertise, communication barriers, limited resources, and systemic challenges. Using the SEIPS 2.0 framework, the complex interactions between work systems (people, tools, tasks, organisation and environment) and work processes were identified, which impact safety outcomes for both clinical pharmacists and people with dementia. Interviews revealed a spectrum of risks associated with dementia care in primary care. This study highlights the complex interplay of factors influencing the safety of dementia care. A proactive, multifaceted approach addressing training, interprofessional collaboration, and system-level adaptations is crucial to mitigate these risks and enhance patient safety in dementia care.",PloS one,2025,Alice Burnand; Kumud Kantilal; Abi Woodward; Cini Bhanu; Jill Manthorpe; Mine Orlu; Greta Rait; Kritika Samsi; Liz Sampson; Victoria Vickerstaff; Jane Wilcock; Yogini Jani; Nathan Davies
40554512,A comprehensive mapping of stress system interactions with pain and their contribution to chronification of musculoskeletal pain: Protocol of the STRAIN study.,"Stress is suggested to be an important factor contributing to the development and persistence of musculoskeletal pain. Although stress and pain interactions are well known, it remains largely unclear how (dys)function of the major stress systems (i.e., the autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) contributes to pain extent and duration, and what the underlying mechanisms are. A comprehensive characterization of the stress systems and their interactions with pain is needed to better understand how stress confers vulnerability for persistent pain. The primary aim of this study is to characterize stress system (dys)functioning (i.e., including basal levels, reactivity and recovery to acute stress, and chronic stress levels) in musculoskeletal pain groups with varying pain duration and extent, and to investigate the interaction between stress and pain at the psychosocial, (psycho)physiological and neural level. The secondary aim is to define the contribution of stress to pain trajectories, including chronification and recovery. A study with a cross-sectional and a longitudinal arm will be conducted in musculoskeletal pain groups with varying pain characteristics, including chronic widespread pain (fibromyalgia), chronic and subacute localized pain (low back pain), and pain-free controls (n = 35/group). To characterize pain trajectories (recovery/persisting), localized pain groups will be reassessed after six months. Stress and pain characteristics and functionality will be assessed using questionnaires, autonomic measures (alpha-amylase, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, skin conductance and skin temperature), hormonal concentrations (cortisol and oxytocin), quantitative sensory testing (pain thresholds, pain tolerances, conditioned pain modulation and temporal summation of pain), and magnetic resonance imaging (brain structure and function). This study will provide crucial insights in the role of stress in the extent of pain symptomatology and in conferring risk for pain chronicity. Additionally, it will shed light on the underlying mechanisms of stress and pain interactions.

40554510,Association between serum zinc and serum neurofilament light chains: A population-based analysis.,"While serum zinc levels are strongly associated with various neurological disorders, the relationship between serum zinc and axonal damage remains largely unexplored. Consequently, the objective of this study was to investigate whether an association exists between serum zinc levels and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) concentrations in the general population. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted during 2013-2014 were utilized for this study. We applied multiple linear regression and smoothed curve fitting methods to explore the connection between serum zinc levels and sNfL. Furthermore, subgroup analyses and interaction tests were performed to assess the consistency of this association among various populations. This analysis included a total of 585 adults. After controlling for various confounding variables, we identified a significant negative association between serum zinc levels and sNfL (β = -0.62, 95% CI: -1.18, -0.05, p = 0.0321). Stratified analyses revealed that this negative association was significant only among individuals who were divorced, widowed, or separated, with no such association observed in other subgroups. This finding suggests that serum zinc levels may have a more pronounced impact on neurological health within these specific populations. Additionally, we identified an L-shaped association between serum zinc and sNfL, with an inflection point at 10.21 nmol/L. Our findings demonstrate an inverse association between serum zinc levels and sNfL concentrations among adults in the United States. This relationship is particularly pronounced in individuals who are divorced, widowed, or separated.",PloS one,2025,Jun Wei; Ye Xu; Yang Liu
40554484,Predicting podoplanin expression and prognostic significance in high-grade glioma based on TCGA TCIA radiomics.,"Podoplanin (PDPN) is a membrane glycoprotein implicated in tumor invasion and immune modulation in high-grade gliomas (HGGs). However, the non-invasive prediction of PDPN expression and its prognostic significance using radiomics remains unexplored. This study used preoperative contrast-enhanced MRI T1WI data analyzed by gradient boosting machine to predict podoplanin (PDPN) expression and overall survival (OS) in HGG patients. We retrospectively analyzed 89 HGG patients' clinical data, MRI images, and RNA-seq profiles from TCIA. For each patient, 107 radiomics features were extracted from HGG subregions. The radiomics prognostic model was built using two selected features, glcm_Idmn and glcn_Idn. Through validation with external the REMBRANDT dataset (n=39), the model demonstrated great predictive performance for the PDPN expression levels and OS in HGG. The area under the curve of the ROC in the radiomics signature combined with clinical risk factors for the 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year OS rates in the TCIA-HGG were 0.799, 0.883, and 0.923, respectively. Gradient boosting machine using preoperative MRI T1WI and extracted radiomics features performed well in predicting the expression of PDPN and OS in HGG. Radiomics features extracted from MRI images can non-invasively predict PDPN expression and prognosis in HGG, offering a potential imaging biomarker for individualized clinical management.",PloS one,2025,Shengrong Long; Hongyu Xu; Mingdong Li; Lesheng Wang; Jiazhi Jiang; Wei Wei; Xiang Li
40554481,"Attentional biases, as measured by motion-induced blindness, are linked to schizophrenia traits.","Typically, people demonstrate a small attentional bias towards the left visual field. This bias has not consistently been observed in schizophrenia. Schizophrenia has been thought to be linked to a top visual field bias, due to an impaired dorsal stream found in those individuals. Here we assessed left/right and upper/lower spatial biases measuring perceptual disappearances in a motion-induced blindness (MIB) task and link those to schizophrenia traits. The sample were consisted of first year psychology students (N = 54; 22 males, 31 females, and 1 prefer not to say; age 18-54 years; median age = 23). Schizophrenia traits were measured using the schizotypal personality questionnaire (SPQ) and perceptual aberration scale (PAS). We found that higher SPQ scores correlated with a top field bias. Higher interpersonal scores (an SPQ subscore) linked to a right field, and so did PAS (p = .007). Higher cognitive-perceptual scores linked to a left field bias. Taken together, this study supports a complex relation between spatial attention and schizophrenia traits in MIB, in which a top field bias may reflect an impaired dorsal stream. A possible implication of these findings is that MIB may serve as a potential tool for screening early schizophrenia traits.",PloS one,2025,Joshua Paton; Jeroen J A van Boxtel
40554463,Characterizing Long COVID Symptoms During Early Childhood.,"Recent studies have identified characteristic symptom patterns of long COVID (LC) in adults and children older than 5 years. However, LC remains poorly characterized in early childhood. This knowledge gap limits efforts to identify, care for, and prevent LC in this vulnerable population. To identify symptoms that had the greatest difference in frequency comparing children with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection to those without, to identify differences in the types of symptoms by age group (infants/toddlers [0-2 years] vs preschool-aged children [3-5 years]), and to derive an index that can be used in research studies to identify young children with LC. This was a multisite longitudinal cohort study with enrollment from over 30 US health care and community settings, including infants, toddlers, and preschool-aged children with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection history. Study data were analyzed from May to December 2024. SARS-CoV-2 infection. LC and 41 symptoms among infants/toddlers and 75 symptoms among preschool-aged children. The study included 472 infants/toddlers (mean [SD] age, 12 [9] months; 278 infected with SARS-CoV-2; 194 uninfected; 234 male [50%]; 73 Black or African American [16%]; 198 Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish [43%]; 242 White [52%]) and 539 preschool-aged children (mean [SD] age, 48 [10] months; 399 infected with SARS-CoV-2; 140 uninfected; 277 female [51%]; 70 Black or African American [13%]; 210 Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish [39%]; 287 White [54%]). The median (IQR) time between first infections and completion of symptom surveys was 318 (198-494) days for infants/toddlers and 520 (330-844) days for preschool-aged children. A research index was derived for each age group based on symptoms most associated with infection history. The index is calculated by summing scores assigned to each prolonged symptom that was present, where higher scores indicate greater magnitude of association with history of SARS-CoV-2 infection: poor appetite (5 points), trouble sleeping (3.5 points), wet cough (3.5 points), dry cough (3 points), and stuffy nose (0.5 points) for infants/toddlers, and daytime tiredness/sleepiness/low energy (6.5 points) and dry cough (3 points) for preschool-aged children. Among infants/toddlers with infection, 40 of 278 (14%) were classified as having probable LC by having an index of at least 4 points. Among preschool-aged children, 61 of 399 (15%) were classified as having probable LC by having an index of at least 3 points. Participants with higher indices often had poorer overall health, lower quality of life, and perceived delays in developmental milestones. This cohort study identified symptom patterns and derived research indices that were distinct between the 2 age groups and differed from those previously identified in older ages, demonstrating the need to characterize LC separately across age ranges.",JAMA pediatrics,2025,Rachel S Gross; Tanayott Thaweethai; Amy L Salisbury; Lawrence C Kleinman; Sindhu Mohandas; Kyung E Rhee; Jessica N Snowden; Kelan G Tantisira; David Warburton; John C Wood; Patricia A Kinser; Joshua D Milner; Erika B Rosenzweig; Katherine Irby; Valerie J Flaherman; Elizabeth W Karlson; Lori B Chibnik; Deepti B Pant; Aparna Krishnamoorthy; Richard Gallagher; Michelle F Lamendola-Essel; Denise C Hasson; Stuart D Katz; Shonna Yin; Benard P Dreyer; Frank Blancero; Megan Carmilani; K Coombs; Megan L Fitzgerald; Rebecca J Letts; Aimee K Peddie; Andrea S Foulkes; Melissa S Stockwell; Judy L Aschner; Andrew M Atz; Dithi Banerjee; Amanda Bogie; Hulya Bukulmez; Katharine Clouser; Lesley A Cottrell; Kelly Cowan; Viren A D'Sa; Allen Dozor; Amy J Elliott; E Vincent S Faustino; Alexander G Fiks; Sunanda Gaur; Maria L Gennaro; Stewart Gordon; Uzma N Hasan; Christina M Hester; Alexander Hogan; Daniel S Hsia; David C Kaelber; Jessica S Kosut; Sankaran Krishnan; Russell J McCulloh; Ian C Michelow; Sheila M Nolan; Carlos R Oliveira; Lynn M Olson; Wilson D Pace; Paul Palumbo; Hengameh Raissy; Andy Reyes; Judith L Ross; Juan C Salazar; Rangaraj Selvarangan; Cheryl R Stein; Michelle D Stevenson; Ronald J Teufel; Alan Werzberger; John M Westfall; Kathleen Zani; William T Zempsky; Emily Zimmerman; Marie-Abele C Bind; James Chan; Zoe Guan; Richard E Morse; Harrison T Reeder; Torri D Metz; Jane W Newburger; Dongngan T Truong
40554452,Effect of the Preoperative Application of Esketamine on Stress Indicators in Paediatric Patients Undergoing Bronchoalveolar Lavage Under General Anaesthesia.,"<b>Aims/Background</b> To explore the effect of the preoperative administration of esketamine on stress indices in paediatric patients undergoing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) under general anaesthesia. <b>Methods</b> A retrospective cohort study was conducted to collect clinical data from children undergoing BAL under general anaesthesia in Tianjin Hospital of Tianjin University between February 2021 and January 2024. The patients were divided into two groups: the reference group (taking no preoperative medications) and the study group (receiving preoperative esketamine). The baseline variables of the two groups were balanced using the 1:1 nearest neighbour matching method of propensity score matching (PSM), and the outcome indicators of the matched cohorts were compared. <b>Results</b> A total of 168 patients were included, including 86 in the reference group and 82 in the study group. After PSM, 46 cases in each group were successfully matched. Results showed that all postoperative stress indicators in the study group were significantly lower than those in the reference group (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The Paediatric Anaesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scores and Face, Legs, Arms, Crying, Consolability (FLACC) scale scores of the children in the study group were significantly lower than those in the reference group (<i>p</i> < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the overall incidence of perioperative adverse reactions between the two groups (<i>p</i> > 0.05). <b>Conclusion</b> The preoperative application of esketamine can reduce the stress response in paediatric patients undergoing BAL under general anaesthesia. This effect is beneficial for enhancing the outcome of surgical treatment.","British journal of hospital medicine (London, England : 2005)",2025,Jizheng Zhang; Jiaming Zheng; Xiaohua Sun; Yi Li; Wanlu Ren
40554450,"Improving Understanding, Recognition and Treatment for Men With Anorexia Nervosa.","<b>Aims/Background</b> Anorexia Nervosa (AN) in males is often overlooked due to the traditional perception of eating disorders as female concerns. Despite this, there has been an increased focus on male presentations. Research evidence, including concerns from people with lived experience, highlights specific risks and unmet clinical needs as a result of delayed help-seeking, inaccessible services, and treatment that does not account for men's needs. <b>Methods</b> Published research and personal narrative from an author with lived experience are combined to assess (1) existing evidence and gaps in knowledge and treatment for males with AN, and (2) solutions which may address challenges across research, policy, and clinical practice. <b>Results</b> There is an increased prevalence of AN amongst males, with most recent data from National Health Service (NHS) England showing a faster increase in hospitalisations amongst males compared with females. However, the quantity and quality of prevalence data and research into the drivers of this trend are severely lacking. The exclusion of males from clinical research has hindered efforts to assess the efficacy of current AN treatments, despite emerging evidence for males-specific symptoms and health impacts across biopsychosocial domains. These include more frequent use of excessive exercise, feelings of emasculation, neurodivergence, and specific physiological risks occurring at higher weights than females. These factors combine with under-resourced treatment provision which often feels exclusionary to males to create an increased risk of death and significant barriers to recovery. <b>Conclusion</b> Evidenced solutions for providing more timely recognition and effective treatment for males with AN are limited, emphasising the importance of further research. Present-day clinical practice needs to ensure the safe medical management of males with AN, taking an integrated approach to treatment that accounts for co-occurring conditions and minority status identities. Being more responsive to the needs of males with AN and removing the barriers to effective care can be aided by projects that collaborate with men with lived experience.","British journal of hospital medicine (London, England : 2005)",2025,James Downs; Clive Kelly
40554441,"Combined Effects of Donepezil and Memantine on Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms, Cognitive Function, and Daily Living Abilities in Patients With Alzheimer's Disease.","<b>Aims/Background</b> Combined with memantine, donepezil has a beneficial impact on the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it can potentially increase the risk of adverse events. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of low-dose and high-dose donepezil combined with memantine on the behavioral and psychological symptoms, cognitive function, and daily living abilities of patients with moderate to severe AD, and to explore their safety. <b>Methods</b> This retrospective study includes 106 AD patients who received treatment in the Third People's Hospital of Fuyang from January 2022 to January 2024. The patients were grouped according to treatment regimen: patients receiving low-dose donepezil (5 mg/day) combined with memantine were included in the low-dose group (<i>n</i> = 45), and those receiving high-dose donepezil (10 mg/day) combined with memantine were included in the high-dose group (<i>n</i> = 61). The assessment results of behavioral and psychological symptoms, cognitive function, daily living ability, quality of life, sleep quality, as well as the occurrence of adverse reactions during treatment were obtained from electronic medical records for the two groups of patients before and after 24 weeks of treatment, and were compared using appropriate statistical tests. <b>Results</b> After 24 weeks of treatment, the scores of neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) and behavioral pathology in Alzheimer's disease rating scale (BEHAVE-AD) were similar between the two groups (<i>p</i> > 0.05). The scores of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive section (ADAS-Cog) were similar between the two groups (<i>p</i> > 0.05). The scores of activities of daily living (ADL) were comparable between the two groups (<i>p</i> > 0.05), and the low-dose group had significantly higher quality of life-Alzheimer's disease (QOL-AD) scores compared to the high-dose group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores of patients in the high-dose group were significantly higher than those before treatment and those in the low-dose group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in PSQI scores between the low-dose group before and after treatment (<i>p</i> > 0.05). During the treatment period, the total incidence of adverse reactions in the low-dose group was significantly lower than that in the high-dose group (11.11% vs. 27.87%, <i>p</i> < 0.05). <b>Conclusion</b> Both 5 mg/day or 10 mg/day donepezil in combination with memantine holds the potential to improve behavioral and psychological symptoms, cognitive function and daily living abilities in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. In addition, high doses of donepezil may lead to decreased sleep quality in patients, increased risk of adverse reactions, and less improvement in quality of life than low doses.","British journal of hospital medicine (London, England : 2005)",2025,Hongyan Tu; Si Zhou; Jixin Lin
40554439,Bidirectional Causal Relationship Between Myopia and Neurodegenerative Diseases: Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization Analyses.,"<b>Aims/Background</b> Myopia is highly prevalent in certain neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), and both conditions demonstrate genetic susceptibility. This study investigated the potential bidirectional causal relationships between myopia and four NDDs, Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), using Mendelian randomization (MR). We aimed to determine whether myopia contributes to the risk of NDDs and vice versa. <b>Methods</b> We analyzed data from two independent, large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) cohorts on myopia, comprising 212,571 participants in the first cohort (finn-b-H7_MYOPIA) and 95,619 in the second (GCST009521). GWAS summary statistics for the four NDDs, encompassing 589,439 samples, were also incorporated. Bidirectional MR was employed to investigate causal relationships between myopia and each of the four NDDs. The inverse variance-weighted (IVW) method served as the primary analytical approach. Sensitivity analyses, including MR-Egger regression, weighted median, weighted mode, and simple mode, were conducted to assess the robustness of the findings. Horizontal pleiotropy was evaluated using the MR-Egger regression intercept test and the Mendelian randomization pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) global test, while heterogeneity was assessed via Cochran's Q test. Leave-one-out analyses were conducted to evaluate the influence of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported, and statistical significance was set at <i>p</i> < 0.05. <b>Results</b> MR analyses identified no evidence of a causal relationship between myopia and refractive error and increased risk of any of the four NDDs (all <i>p</i> > 0.05). Similarly, none of the NDDs were associated with an increased risk of myopia or refractive error (all <i>p</i> > 0.05). Sensitivity analyses revealed no SNPs with significant influence on the causal associations (all <i>p</i> > 0.05), supporting the robustness of the findings. <b>Conclusion</b> This study provides no evidence of a bidirectional causal relationship between myopia and the four NDDs among individuals of European ancestry. Future research should extend beyond direct causal inference to investigate potential mediating biological mechanisms.","British journal of hospital medicine (London, England : 2005)",2025,Yuanyuan Fan; Zhijie Wang; Mengai Wu; Li Lin; Lifeng Chen; Bin Zheng

However, wide heterogeneity in study design and reporting poses challenges in assessing the reliability, validity and utility of these biomarkers. In this evolving field, best practices are sometimes debated but not yet rigorously defined, and the appropriate next step is to ensure that validation-focused research manuscripts report key methodological factors that are known or suspected to influence results. To assist authors in designing and reporting validation studies of EEG biomarkers, and to help editors and regulatory bodies evaluate them, an international working group-under the auspices of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology (IFCN) and in collaboration with the EQUATOR Network-developed the Guidelines for Reporting EEG/Neurophysiology Biomarker Evaluation for Application to Neurology and Neuropsychiatry (GREENBEAN). EEG biomarker validation studies are classified into four phases, similarly to therapeutic studies. Phases 1-2 are preliminary and do not constitute formal validation. Phase 3 studies provide compelling evidence of validity, while phase 4 studies assess the clinical utility and generalizability of previously validated biomarkers within real-world settings. We provide detailed definitions for each phase, along with a checklist of items to address and report. A detailed Explanation and Elaboration document is included in Supplementary Material with multiple examples of how to design and report EEG biomarker studies. We expect that more transparent reporting regarding experimental design and technical standards will not only enhance short-term biomarker validation efforts but will also enhance methodological research to make future efforts more efficient and effective.",Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,2025,Joshua B Ewen; Claudio Babiloni; Gary S Collins; Lauren E Ethridge; Jean Gotman; Akio Ikeda; Philippa J Karoly; William Z Potter; Stephan Rampp; Margitta Seeck; Sándor Beniczky
40554363,Hospital frailty risk score in predicting outcomes after simultaneous colon and liver resection for colorectal cancer liver metastasis in older adults: Evidence from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2015-2018.,"This study investigated the impact of clinical frailty on short-term outcomes of simultaneous colorectal cancer (CRC) and colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) resections. Data of older patients ≥ 60 years old undergoing simultaneous CRC/CRLM resections between 2005 and 2018 were identified in the United States (US) Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. Frailty was determined using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) according to the International Classification of Diseases Ninth and Tenth (ICD-9 and ICD-10) codes. Study outcomes included mortality, prolonged hospital stay (LOS), non-routine discharge, and complications. Data of 4514 patients were analyzed. Frailty was significantly associated with increased risks of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.65, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.52, 5.28), non-routine discharge (aOR = 2.44, 95% CI: 2.08, 2.87), prolonged LOS (aOR = 3.07, 95% CI: 2.60, 3.61), overall complications (aOR = 3.47, 95% CI: 3.03, 3.97), sepsis (aOR = 13.73, 95% CI: 9.76, 19.31), respiratory failure (aOR = 4.99, 95% CI: 3.80, 6.57), acute kidney injury (AKI) (aOR = 6.42, 95% CI: 4.83, 8.52), and acute liver failure (aOR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.38, 3.21), as well as 32.69 thousand USD higher total hospital costs (95% CI: 28.41, 36.97) than no frailty. Incorporating frailty with traditional demographic and clinical risk factors improved in-hospital mortality prediction (area under ROC curve [AUC]: 0.765 to 0.799). In older patients aged ≥ 60 years undergoing simultaneous CRC and CRLM resection, HFRS-defined frailty is a significant predictor of adverse in-hospital outcomes. The addition of HFRS-defined frailty to demographic and clinical variables in predictive models improved the AUC for mortality prediction. Incorporating frailty assessment into the preoperative risk stratification and decision-making process for these patients may support surgeons in delivering more personalized and effective care.","The journal of nutrition, health & aging",2025,Haohao Huang; Weidong Jin; Huiling Sun; Bo Diao; Ping Wang; Jiankun Jia; Dandan Ma; Yi Zhang
40554329,Insomnia and emotion dysregulation: a meta-analytical perspective integrating regulatory strategies and dispositional difficulties.,"Insomnia and emotion dysregulation are intricately related, yet their aggregate association across different domains of emotion dysregulation and the effect of moderating factors including health-related status, age, and gender remain unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized data from 57 studies, pooling 119 effect sizes from correlational and 55 effect sizes from group comparison studies. By separate analyses, we assessed both the strength of the association and whether clinically significant insomnia symptoms exacerbate difficulty in regulating emotion. Correlational analyses revealed a significant association between insomnia symptoms and emotion dysregulation, primarily in individuals with serious health-related conditions (Fisher Z<sub>no-serious condition</sub> = 0.22, Fisher Z<sub>serious-conditions</sub> = 0.37, p < 0.00001). Group comparison analyses indicated that clinically significant insomnia symptoms present worse emotion dysregulation regardless of health-related status (Hedges' g = 0.99, p = 0.01). The reliance on maladaptive emotion regulation strategies and difficulties in dispositional domains of emotion regulation, particularly impulsivity, were more strongly associated with insomnia than challenges related to adaptive strategies. Age and gender did not impact these associations in either type of study. These findings underscore a robust link between insomnia and emotion dysregulation, suggesting the potential benefits of integrating emotion regulation skills into insomnia management to improve therapeutic outcomes.",Sleep medicine reviews,2025,Fateme Samea; Nasrin Mortazavi; Gerion M Reimann; Amir Ebneabbasi; Mojtaba Zarei; Habibolah Khazaie; Andrea N Goldstein-Piekarski; Kai Spiegelhalder; Chiara Baglioni; Amir A Sepehry; Masoud Tahmasian

40554236,"Drivers of adolescent chasing behavior: The role of craving, decision-making, alcohol use, and gambling severity.","Craving and impaired decision-making are hallmark features of addiction, playing a prominent role in gambling disorder. These factors are central to loss-chasing behavior, a core diagnostic criterion of gambling dependence characterized by persistent attempts to recover prior losses. This study examines the interplay of craving, affective decision-making, decision-making styles, alcohol use, and gambling severity in chasing behavior among 272 Italian adolescents aged 14-19. Participants completed validated measures, including the South Oaks Gambling Screen-Revised for Adolescents (SOGS-RA), Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), General Decision-Making Style (GDMS), Gambling Craving Scale (GACS), and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Chasing behavior was assessed using a computerized task, with participants randomly assigned to either a Control or Loss condition. Regression and path analyses indicated that craving was the strongest predictor of both chasing initiation and persistence, while alcohol consumption was uniquely associated with greater chasing persistence. Conversely, a dependent decision-making style emerged as a protective factor, being associated with reduced engagement in chasing behavior. Notably, neither gambling severity (measured by the SOGS-RA) nor affective decision-making capacity (assessed via the IGT) predicted chasing outcomes. These findings suggest that chasing operates as an independent behavioral mechanism within gambling disorder, distinct from generalized gambling severity or neurocognitive decision-making deficits.",Addictive behaviors,2025,Marina Cosenza; Barbara Pizzini; Maria Ciccarelli; Mariagiulia Sacco; Giovanna Nigro

40554195,Contribution of activated complements and CD59 to the pathophysiology of Rasmussen syndrome.,"Rasmussen syndrome (RS) is an autoimmune-associated epilepsy with refractory seizures and deteriorating motor and cognitive functions. We expect to unveil complex immunological pathophysiology from the viewpoint of complements to establish newer immunomodulatory treatments. We examined CSF levels of activated complements (iC3b, C5a and soluble membrane attack complex (sMAC)) and CD59 (inhibitor of MAC) using ELISA kits in 36 patients with RS and 44 disease controls (DCs). Disease duration from the onset of RS to CSF examination (mean ± SD) was 80.5 ± 89.7 months (n = 73). Seizure frequency at CSF examination was daily in 56, weekly in four, monthly in six, yearly in four and seizure-free in three CSF samples. The level of iC3b was significantly higher in RS than in DCs, but that of C5a, sMAC or CD59 was not different between RS and DCs. Levels of iC3b increased along with duration of disease. The ratio of patients with the levels of CD59 more than zero increased after the acute stage. Levels of CD59 in patients with daily seizure frequency were significantly lower than those with seizure control. The odds ratio between levels of CD59 and IVIg treatment by multiple linear regression analyses was significantly high. Maximum datum of activated complements or CD59 among the course of each patient was not related with final motor, cognitive and seizure outcomes. Reduction of CD59 may be one of crucial pathologies in the early stage of RS.",Journal of neuroimmunology,2025,Yukitoshi Takahashi; Shigeko Nishimura; Emiko Takao; Risa Kasai; Masataka Fukuoka; Tokito Yamaguchi; Yasukiyo Araki; Chihiro Yonee; Osamu Kawano; Yoshiyuki Kondo; Natsumi Saito; Takefumi Higashijima; Yasuko Kuroha; Keisuke Watanabe; Tamami Yano; Hirofumi Kashii; Kazunori Ogawa; Kenichi Maeda; Maasa Abe; Misa Nakamura; Youhei Himeno; Naoki Hayashi; Osamu Kobayashi; Shinobu Fukumura; Yoshinori Okumura; Yosuke Miyamoto; Yukiko Mogami
40554136,Focus on epilepsy and epilepsy syndromes in children with autism spectrum disorders: a study of 74 patients.,"Epilepsy is a common finding in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but few studies describe the characteristics of epilepsy in these children. Our study aimed to characterize the electroclinical features of children with ASD and epilepsy through a retrospective multicenter study. Patients with ASD who subsequently developed epilepsy seen at nine pediatric neurology departments were included. Patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE), chronic neurological diseases with epilepsy who developed autism, and those with non-epileptic paroxysmal disorders were excluded. Overall, 74 patients were included, accounting for 15 % of 494 children with ASD seen between 2015 and 2023; 39 were female (52.7 %) and 35 male (47.3 %). Focal epilepsies were identified in 43 patients (58.1 %), which were non-self-limited in 24 and self-limited in 19. Generalized epilepsies were observed in 19 (25.7 %), including six with generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone (one in childhood, five in adolescence), nine with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, one with childhood absence epilepsy, and three with juvenile absence epilepsy. Eight patients (10.8 %) had epileptic encephalopathies: EE-SWAS in six and epilepsy with myoclonic atonic seizures in two. Four patients (5.4 %) had combined focal and generalized epilepsy. No significant differences were found between epilepsy syndrome or type of epilepsy, seizure type, and comorbidities. No specific epilepsy phenotype was identified in our patients with ASD; the types of epilepsy and syndromes were similar to those seen in the general population. Management should address both epilepsy and the broader complexities of ASD through an integrated approach.",Brain & development,2025,Roberto H Caraballo; Sebastian Fortini; Lucas Beltrán; Marcos Semprino; Santiago Galicchio; Alberto Espeche; Gabriela Reyes Valenzuela; Santiago Chacón; Beatriz Gamboni; Javier Adi; Lorena Fasulo; Agustin Calvo; Pedro Cachia
40554101,Endothelial soluble epoxide hydrolase links polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism to oxidative stress and atherosclerosis progression.,"Atheroslcerosis manifests as localized lesions within the vascular tree, preferentially affecting arteries at branch points, the outer wall of bifurcations and the inner walls of curvatures. Such spatial localized sensitivity to atherosclerosis, can be partially attributed to endothelial cell heterogeneity which compromises vascular fitness and contributes to the pathogenesis of the diseases. Here we identified that in a subcluster of aortic endothelial cells characterized with atheroprone gene signatures, the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) metabolic enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is selectively upregulated. Genetic endothelial-specific overexpression of the sEH resulted in excessive and accelerated atherosclerosis development, while inducible endothelial-specific deletion of sEH protected against PCSK9 mediated atherosclerotic plaque formation. Mechanistically, sEH-derived docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) diol (19,20-DHDP) disrupts mitochondrial protein-cholesterol associations in endothelial cells, which through reduced oxidizing metabolic import of pyruvate and malate inhibited mitochondrial Complex I activity. Such inhibition, resulted in a lowering of the mitochondrial membrane potential and subsequent excessive mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and disrupted mitochondrial structure. Heightened mitochondrial redox generation ultimately led to TGFβ activation and the subsequent stimulation of an athroprone and pro-inflammatory endothelial transcriptional programme. Re-establishing redox homeostasis by antioxidant treatments, halted the atheroprone phenotypes of sEH overexpressing vessels. Our data propose that manipulating endothelial PUFA metabolism and sEH activity in the endothelium can exert vascular protective effects.",Redox biology,2025,Minghua Cao; Mengqing Li; Xixuan Li; Yuanyuan Li; Yunyun Chen; Maria-Kyriaki Drekolia; Xiang Cheng; Fredy Delgado Lagos; Sofia-Iris Bibli; Jiong Hu
40553999,"Left-right confusion in psychiatric, neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders: a systematic review.","Left-right confusion is common in healthy individuals, but increased prevalence has been reported in several psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurological disorders. The present systematic review aimed to identify disorders in which the prevalence of left-right confusion is higher than in the general population. For this purpose, a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines was conducted using the databases Google Scholar, PubMed, and Mendeley. A total of 20 quantitative case-control studies were included. Lesions in parietal brain areas and damage to temporal-parietal-occipital brain areas because of Alzheimer's disease were associated with severe impairments in left-right orientation. Furthermore, evidence for developmental impairments in direction assignment was provided by studies on developmental topographical disorientation (DTD). These DTD-related impairments are associated with low functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the right prefrontal cortex. Individuals with DTD show significantly poorer performance in direction discrimination compared to healthy subjects. In addition, the review highlights that, despite previous research, there remains a substantial need for further studies and for the development of a uniform definition and operationalization of left-right confusion in clinical populations.",Brain research bulletin,2025,Moritz Thaler; Sebastian Ocklenburg
40553933,"Sex differences in neurological disorders: Insights from ischemic stroke, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis.","Ischemic stroke, Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS), are neurodegenerative disorders that exhibit significant sex differences in pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and outcomes. Women are more likely to experience strokes in older age, with estrogen playing dual protective/detrimental roles depending on reproductive age. In PD, men show earlier onset and steadier decline, while women exhibit a protective estrogen-driven advantage and distinct gut-brain axis interactions. MS disproportionately affects women (3:1 ratio), particularly during reproductive years, with sex hormones and X-linked genes modulating autoimmune demyelination. This review synthesizes sex-specific mechanisms across these diseases, emphasizing immune dysregulation, hormonal influences, and emerging roles of the gut microbiome. Key modifiers such as epigenetic factors, microbiome composition, and sex chromosome interactions are discussed to inform personalized therapeutic strategies.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2025,Cassandra J Kaufhold; Kathiresh Kumar Mani; Zara Akbari; Farida Sohrabji
40553926,"A critical role for the Fascin family of actin bundling proteins in axon development, brain wiring and function.","Actin-based cell motility drives many neurodevelopmental events including guided axonal growth. Fascin is a major family of F-actin bundling proteins, but its role in axon development in vivo and brain wiring remains unclear. Here, we report that fascin is required for axon development, brain wiring and function. We show that fascin is enriched in the motile filopodia of axonal growth cones and its inhibition impairs axonal extension and branching of hippocampal neurons in culture. We next provide evidence that fascin is essential for axon development and brain wiring in vivo using Drosophila melanogaster as a model. Drosophila expresses a single ortholog of mammalian fascin called Singed (SN), which is expressed in the mushroom body (MB) of the central nervous system. Loss of SN causes severe MB disruption, marked by α- and β-lobe defects indicative of altered axonal guidance. SN-null flies also exhibit defective sensorimotor behaviors as assessed by the negative geotaxis assay. MB-specific expression of SN in SN-null flies rescues MB structure and sensorimotor deficits, indicating that SN functions autonomously in MB neurons. Together, our data from primary neuronal culture and in vivo models highlight a critical role for fascin in brain development and function.",Molecular and cellular neurosciences,2025,Katherine R Hardin; Arjolyn B Penas; Shuristeen Joubert; Changtian Ye; Kenneth R Myers; James Q Zheng
40553909,Applications and prospects of synthetic receptors for therapeutic protein delivery.,"Synthetic receptors have gained prominence in synthetic biology due to their tunability, simplicity, versatility, and capacity for precise gene editing, which collectively enhance the temporal and spatial control of therapeutic protein delivery. Several types of synthetic receptors have been engineered to deliver specific therapeutic proteins, including G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-based receptor systems, modular extracellular sensor architecture (MESA), synthetic Notch (synNotch) receptor, and synthetic intramembrane proteolysis receptors (SNIPRs). These receptors have demonstrated therapeutic potential in targeting tumors, inflammatory immune diseases, central nervous system disorders, arthropathies, and viral infections by delivering specific proteins to diseased tissues. However, several challenges persist, including safety concerns, suboptimal delivery efficiency, and receptor design and optimization complexity.

40553905,Sleep Disorders and Sleep Medications as Risk Factors for Dementia in Kidney Transplant Recipients: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Older (aged≥55 years) kidney transplant (KT) recipients diagnosed with a sleep disorder after transplantation may be at increased risk for developing dementia. Using USRDS/Medicare claims (2010-2020), we identified 16,573 older KT recipients with a functioning graft 1-year post-KT. First-time sleep disorders and newly prescribed sleep medications were ascertained within the first year post-KT. We used cause-specific hazard models to estimate the hazard ratio (aHR) of diagnosed dementia with inverse probability of treatment weights. Overall, 3,615 (21.8%) KT recipients were newly diagnosed with sleep disorders. Recipients diagnosed with a sleep disorder had a 1.32-fold increased risk for dementia (95%CI:1.15-1.51); those with insomnia had a 1.56-fold increased risk (95%CI:1.20-2.03). Of those diagnosed with insomnia, only 7.5% underwent cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). 12.9% of recipients with a sleep disorder were prescribed sleep medications. Recipients prescribed sleep medication had a 1.44-fold increased risk for dementia (95%CI:1.16-1.77). Those prescribed zolpidem, the most commonly prescribed medication (80.1%), had a 1.41-fold increased risk (95%CI:1.12-1.78) for dementia; those prescribed other sleep medications had 3.13-fold (95%CI:1.41-6.98) increased risk for dementia. Post-KT sleep disorders are modifiable dementia risk factors; medication-associated dementia risk should be weighed against other therapies such as CBT-I during management.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,2025,Yusi Chen; Jane J Long; Nidhi Ghildayal; Yiting Li; Chenxi Gao; Brandon Chou; Kevin Cheng; Malika Wilson; Mario P DeMarco; Nicole M Ali; Sunjae Bae; Byoungjun Kim; Babak J Orandi; Dorry L Segev; Mara A McAdams-DeMarco
40553807,Mechanisms of micro- and nanoplastics on blood-brain barrier crossing and neurotoxicity: Current evidence and future perspectives.,"Micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs), as emerging global pollutants, pose increasing threats to ecological environments and human health due to their widespread distribution and potential toxicity. Recent studies have demonstrated that MNPs not only enter the human body through multiple pathways but may also cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), causing irreversible toxic damage to the central nervous system (CNS). This review summarizes the possible mechanisms of MNPs crossing the BBB, including the disruption of tight junctions and adherens juctions, paracellular transport, and endocytosis pathways. We focused on investigating the key roles of oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, mitochondrial dysfunction, and iron metabolism disorders in MNP-induced neurotoxicity, and discovered significant interconnections among these mechanisms. Furthermore, as carriers of pollutants, MNPs can facilitate co-exposure with other environmental contaminants such as heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants, producing synergistic toxic effects that further aggravate neurological damage. This review synthesizes the main research progress in this field, evaluates the potential toxicological impacts of MNPs on the CNS, and identifies key scientific questions that need to be addressed in future research, thereby providing theoretical foundations for in-depth studies of MNP neurotoxicity mechanisms and risk assessment.",Neurotoxicology,2025,Yu Ma; Haitao Yang; Shuyan Niu; Menghao Guo; Yuying Xue

This study investigates the influence of microplastics on the gut microbiome composition and assess subsequent alterations in the cephalic transcriptome, feeding patterns, and overall behaviour of the organism. D. magna individuals were exposed to low and high levels of bioplastic particles and kaolin natural particles and under starving conditions. Feeding and behavioral effects were assessed using previously well-established assays. Changes in gut microbiome composition, cephalic transcription and their functional interpretation were studied by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and cephalic D magna RNA high-throughput sequencing, respectively, and using appropriate bioinformatic pipelines. Only exposures to high concentrations of bioplastic microparticles inhibited feeding and impacted behavioural responses in D. magna, resembling effects observed under starvation. Microbiome analysis revealed shifts in taxonomic composition and functional profiles across the tested microplastic concentrations, which become more notable at higher ones. Functional changes in the gut microbiome indicated that bioplastics at high concentrations altered to a greater extent short-chain fatty acid biosynthesis and tryptophan and L-glutamate metabolism pathways than at low concentrations. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that microplastics up-regulated neurological pathways, cell turnover, and differentiation. In summary exposure to microplastics resulted in gut dysbiosis and increased biosynthesis of short-chain fatty acid signalling pathways in the gut, altered neurological pathways in the cephalic transcriptome and disrupted behavioural responses, altogether supporting the role of the microbiota-gut-brain crosstalk on neurological disorders.","Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2025,María Paula Carrillo; Maria Vila-Costa; Carlos Barata
40553754,Short-chain fatty acids in mood and schizophrenia spectrum disorders: Evidence in the field and translational perspectives.,"The etiology of mood and schizophrenia spectrum disorders remains largely unknown. In recent years, several studies have focused on the role of the microbiome-gut-brain-axis (MGBA) in its etiology, providing several novel insights. The communication within MGBA involves various pathways leading through the vagus nerve and the bloodstream mediators. The latter are represented by short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), produced by gut microbiota from dietary fiber. To date, several physiological and pathophysiological roles in the periphery and the central nervous system for SCFAs have been suggested. Studies investigating gut microbiota have consistently reported a decreased abundance of bacteria-producing SCFAs in people with mood and schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Yet, studies investigating faecal and blood levels of SCFAs have provided mixed findings. The present article provides a narrative review of studies examining the physiological roles of SCFAs, along with animal model and human studies addressing the involvement of SCFAs in mood and schizophrenia spectrum disorders, formulates future directions and provides translational perspectives.",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2025,Julia Karska; Karolina Skonieczna-Żydecka; Natalia Jakubiak; Wiktoria Czarnecka; Błażej Misiak

40553614,The relationship between childhood trauma and depressive symptoms: the serial mediation role of ruminative thinking and prospective imagery vividness.,"Some studies have shown that childhood trauma may damage the cognitive function of patients with mood disorders, which is related to the increase of depression. Other studies highlighted that negative expectations for the future and excessive ruminant thinking have an impact on the maintenance or even exacerbation of depressive symptoms. The current study examined the serial mediating role of rumination and prospective imagery vividness between childhood trauma and depressive symptoms. A total of 1711 college students provided self-report data on the childhood trauma questionnaire, the prospective imagery task, ruminative responses scale and patient health questionnaire-9. Data showed that childhood trauma, ruminative thinking and vividness of prospective negative imagery were inversely related to depressive symptoms. The ruminative thinking and prospective negative imagery completely and serially mediated the relation between childhood trauma and depressive symptoms. Additionally, the ruminative thinking and vividness of prospective positive imagery completely and serially mediated the relation between childhood trauma and depressive symptoms. These results suggest that ruminative thinking and prospective imagery vividness exerted a serial mediating effect in the relationship between childhood trauma and depressive symptoms, increasing the risk of depression.","Psychology, health & medicine",2025,Li Zhou; Nuoling Yao; Zihui Zengxu; Biyun Wu; Mingfan Liu

PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Database of Clinical Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched along with gray literature, including internet search. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs), prospective and retrospective studies which included migraine patients were included. Screening and extraction of data were conducted, and the quality of randomized studies was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. RevMan Web was employed for statistical analysis. About nine studies (<i>n</i> = 874), including seven randomized and two nonrandomized studies, were deemed suitable for data synthesis and analysis. As compared to propranolol, amitriptyline administration significantly lowered the monthly frequency, duration, and severity score of migraines. No significant differences were noted between amitriptyline and flunarizine groups for monthly migraine frequency and migraine severity. Additionally, there were no significant differences in the incidence of adverse reactions following amitriptyline administration when compared with propranolol and flunarizine. Low-dose amitriptyline is a potent prophylactic treatment option for migraine with respect to frequency, duration, as well as severity of migraine episodes. Its efficacy profile is superior to placebo as well as propranolol and comparable to flunarizine, whereas safety profile is comparable to both propranolol and flunarizine.",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India..,2025,A V Srinivasan; K Bhanu
40553592,Expert Opinion on Management Advancements in Sarcopenia: From Muscle Wasting to Recovery.,"Sarcopenia, an age-related condition marked by the decline of skeletal muscle mass, strength, and function, often leads to loss of function, disability, and diminished quality of life (QoL) in the elderly population. Despite its growing prevalence, sarcopenia is frequently underdiagnosed and inadequately managed. Timely detection and appropriate interventions are crucial to slowing disease progression and minimizing associated risks. As standardized guidelines and individualized management plans are necessary to improve clinical outcomes, this consensus paper presents expert insights into advancements in sarcopenia management, including diagnostic criteria and therapeutic interventions, and the need for personalized screening tools for Indian demographics. Furthermore, experts emphasized the importance of a multimodal approach, integrating resistance exercise, nutritional optimization, and emerging pharmacological therapies for effective sarcopenia treatment.

40553540,Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis with Renal Tubular Acidosis in a Patient with Autoimmune Disorder.,"Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HPP) is characterized by transient episodes of skeletal muscle weakness due to hypokalemia. It can arise from primary or secondary causes, with renal tubular acidosis (RTA) being a notable secondary etiology. Here, we present a case of HPP associated with RTA in a patient with an underlying autoimmune disorder, Sjögren syndrome. A 29-year-old female presented with dry eyes and progressive weakness in both upper and lower limbs, leading to immobilization. Clinical examination revealed hypokalemia, normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, and alkaline urinary pH consistent with RTA type I. Immunological tests indicated markers suggestive of Sjögren syndrome. Treatment with potassium chloride resulted in motor function improvement. The coexistence of HPP and RTA underscores the complex interplay between electrolyte disturbances and autoimmune pathology. Sjögren syndrome, an autoimmune exocrinopathy, can manifest with extraglandular involvement, including RTA. The diagnosis was supported by clinical, biochemical, and immunological findings. This case highlights the clinical significance of recognizing HPP as a potential differential diagnosis in patients presenting with limb weakness, particularly in the context of autoimmune disorders such as Sjögren syndrome. Early diagnosis and appropriate management are crucial for preventing life-threatening complications associated with HPP and optimizing patient outcomes.",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India..,2025,Dipankar Dutta; Simran Sein; Manish Gupta; Akash Mehrotra; Danish Ahmad
40553538,Unveiling the Psychiatric and Neurological Manifestations of Idiopathic Hypoparathyroidism: A Case of Auditory Hallucinations and Seizure Disorder.,"Idiopathic hypoparathyroidism (IHP) is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by hypocalcemia, leading to a diverse array of neurological and psychiatric manifestations. The emergence of psychiatric symptoms, particularly those that mirror primary psychiatric disorders, creates considerable difficulties in achieving a precise diagnosis and effective treatment. A 35-year-old female patient was admitted with status epilepticus and a documented history of psychiatric illness. Initial investigations revealed hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyperphosphatemia. A noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head showed striopallidodentate calcification, a characteristic finding in hypoparathyroidism. The patient reported persistent auditory hallucinations for the past 3 years, which were unresponsive to antipsychotic treatment. Additionally, she had a very low serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. Notably, the patient had no history of neck surgery, autoimmune disorders, cancers, radiation therapy, or infiltrative disorders such as hemochromatosis. There were no other congenital abnormalities or family history of similar illnesses. A diagnosis of IHP was established based on the patient's clinical symptoms and the results of the investigations. Calcium and magnesium supplements were started to correct the deficiencies of hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia. Antiepileptic drugs were administered to control seizures. Despite the normalization of serum calcium levels, the patient's auditory hallucinations persisted, indicating a possible need for alternative therapeutic approaches. This report emphasizes the need to consider IHP when diagnosing patients who present with ongoing psychiatric symptoms and seizures. The persistence of auditory hallucinations despite corrected hypocalcemia highlights the complexity of managing psychiatric manifestations in IHP. Early recognition and appropriate management of hypocalcemia are crucial for improving patient outcomes, although some psychiatric symptoms may remain refractory to conventional treatments.",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India..,2025,Juber D Shaikh; Ranjeet K Singh
40553535,Unilateral Vocal Cord Palsy as Presenting Feature of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative pathology marked by the degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons, resulting in muscle weakness and atrophy, impairing motor function. Bulbar-onset ALS is a distinct clinical subtype, with initial involvement of bulbar motor neurons, often causing severe speech and swallowing difficulties. Despite its impact, bulbar-onset ALS, especially with rare symptoms like unilateral vocal cord palsy (UVCP), lacks extensive research. Here, we detail the case of a 79-year-old nonambulatory diabetic male with a 1-year history of hoarseness of voice, diagnosed with bulbar-onset ALS with UVCP. This underscores the importance of recognizing unusual presentations of ALS, particularly in geriatric populations, urging tailored medical evaluations for optimal care and improved outcomes in this challenging neurological condition.",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India..,2025,Koushik Ramachandra; Amruth Reddy Narayana; Anusha Induraj; Rohit Pai
40553529,Guillain-Barré Syndrome in India: A Call for Learning and Cohesive Action.,"In January 2025, a Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) outbreak was reported in Pune, which quickly spread to other states of India. Though GBS is a rare immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy, it is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis globally. Initially described in 1859, knowledge on pathophysiology, disease spectrum, and management has evolved with time. GBS typically develops postinfection, with symptoms emerging within 6 weeks of the infectious trigger. Clinically, GBS commonly presents with bilateral flaccid weakness, often following a monophasic course. However, multiple clinical variants and atypical presentations often lead to delay in diagnosis. Diagnosis of GBS is primarily clinical, with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and electrodiagnostic tests having a supportive role. The concept of ""time is nerve"" should be rooted in practice, and immunomodulatory therapy either as intravenous immune globulin (IVIg) or plasma exchange should be initiated at the earliest. Monitoring for respiratory and autonomic function is critical in management, with specific clinical parameters guiding intensive care unit (ICU) transfer. Overall, holistic and multidisciplinary supportive care is key to reduce patient morbidity and mortality. Stakeholder involvement at multiple levels, including community participation, will be key for effective preventive and curative strategies at local and national level.",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India..,2025,Mangesh Tiwaskar; Parthasarathy Muralidharan
40553526,Dental Health in People Living with Epilepsy.,"With major attention paid to the most evidently manifested illness like a seizure, few of the silent and deep-boring illnesses like dental issues are often neglected. This study has aimed to analyze the dental illness in people living with epilepsy (PWE). This was a prospective, single-center, case-control study conducted among PWE and their family members from March to May 2022. A survey on demographic parameters, dental hygiene practices, and symptoms of dental illness was taken, followed by a detailed dental examination of the study participants. Independent <i>t</i> -test was used to compare dental illness among PWE and controls. A total of 69 patients were included, with a mean age of 32.5 ± 2.4 years, and 45 (63%) patients were symptomatic with dental issues. Patients from higher socioeconomic status were found to have better dental hygiene practices but also had a higher prevalence of wasting disease of teeth. About 67 of 69 PWE and 19 of 33 controls were found to have dental illness. PWE had a higher degree of asymptomatic soft tissue abnormalities (24 vs 0%, <i>p</i> < 0.0001) and periodontal disease (13 vs 7.4%, <i>p</i> < 0.0001) as compared to controls. Symptomatic PWE, in comparison to controls, had statistically significant hard tissue abnormalities (66 vs 33%, <i>p</i> = 0.0001), periodontal disease (48 vs 0%, <i>p</i> < 0.0001), and poor dental hygiene status (83 vs 33%, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). Duration and type of epilepsy had no impact on being symptomatic or asymptomatic with dental issues. The hidden yet significant burden of dental illness must be addressed in PWE to improve the quality of life.",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India..,2025,Lakshmi Priya; Jithin George; Thania E Pidiyencheril; Jayakumari Nandana; Ramshekhar N Menon; Ashalatha Radhakrishnan
40553522,Investigating Neurocognitive Functions in People Living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus: A Cross-sectional Study from an Indian Tertiary Health Care Institution.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated neurocognitive deficits (HAND) distress a substantial proportion of people living with HIV (PLHIV). The present research intends to examine the neurocognitive functions in PLHIV, compared to healthy volunteers. About 48 HIV patients were recruited from one tertiary health care center, while 24 matched healthy volunteers were enrolled as controls from the community. Neurocognitive functions were assessed using the Hindi Mental Status Examination (HMSE), Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE)-III, and International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS) questionnaires, along with the computer-based color-word Stroop cognitive task. The total HMSE scores (<i>p</i> = 0.0047), IHDS scores (<i>p</i> = 0.0002), and ACE-III scores (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) were statistically lower in PLHIV, compared to controls. The specific domain scores of ACE-III in PLHIV were also statistically lower compared to the control group, with greater differences seen in memory (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) and language (<i>p</i> = 0.0012) domains. Similarly, higher reaction time was seen in PLHIV in comparison with the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) during Stroop cognitive task performance, while a statistically significant difference in accuracy was not observed among groups. Further, among PLHIV, reaction time had a significant positive correlation with years since diagnosis of HIV infection (<i>p</i> = 0.006, <i>r</i> = 0.39, Spearman correlation). Observations demonstrate neurocognitive deficits in PLHIV across multiple domains. Our study, therefore, offers insights into the neurocognitive manifestations of HIV infection, which could facilitate tailored preventive and therapeutic interventions by healthcare providers to enhance the overall quality of life for PLHIV.",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India..,2025,Ravindran Revand; Madhur Singhal; Simran Kaur; Neeraj Nischal; Yatan Pal Singh Balhara; Ratna Sharma
40553520,A Comparative Study of Risk Factors across Young and Old Acute Ischemic Strokes: A Hospital-based Study in North India.,"Stroke is an important cause of death and disability. Prevalence of stroke differs with age. The risk factors in young differ in comparison to the old age-group. In this study, risk factors of stroke in young are compared to the old age-group. To compare the established risk factors in young and old acute ischemic strokes. The study was conducted at the neurosciences department of Santokba Durlabhji Memorial Hospital, Jaipur, a tertiary referral center in North India, from June 2015 to December 2016. It was a hospital-based analytical type of observational, cross-sectional study. One hundred fifty stroke patients above 18 years of age were included in young (<50 years) or old age (>50 years) groups. The risk factors of stroke were defined in terms of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, ischemic heart diseases, valvular heart disease, history of transient ischemic attack or stroke, smoking, oral contraceptive pill, raised serum homocysteine, and low serum vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels. Of 150 patients, 75 patients were in the young stroke group and 75 patients in the old stroke group. Out of these 150 patients, 66.67% were males and 33.33% were female patients. The mean age (in years) of young patients was 41.64, while in old stroke patients it was 65.8. Thirty-eight percent in the young group and 72% in the old group had hypertension. Diabetes was found in 16% and 32% in the young and old group, respectively. High serum homocysteine was seen in 64% young and 73% old. Low serum vitamin B<sub>12</sub> was found in 25% young and 32% old. Venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) was reactive in 1.3% in young and 4% in old. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) was positive in 6.6% in young and 2.6% in old. From those tested, antiphospholipid antibody (APLA) was positive in 3.64% in young and 4.16% in old. Cardioembolic stroke was found equally in old as in young. The number of patients with rheumatic heart disease showed comparatively higher numbers in the young group, while atrial fibrillation was higher in the old age-group, signifying the importance of detailed cardiac workup and Holter monitoring in the old age-group when indicated. Serum vitamin B12 and homocysteine levels should be done routinely in the evaluation of ischemic stroke irrespective of the age of onset of stroke(s), as their levels were impaired equally in both young and old age-groups in our study. Dyslipidemia, traditionally regarded as a risk factor in old, also showed deranged values in the form of raised serum cholesterol and triglycerides in both age-groups. Positive VDRL, ANA, and APLA showed an increased trend in the old age-group in our study compared to the young age-group. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and inadequate physical activity were significant risk factors associated with the old group.",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India..,2025,Surinder Sharma; Neeraj Bhutani; Karni Singh; Suresh Gupta; Priya Agrawal; Pranav Gupta
40553493,<i>PIK3CA</i> gain-of-function mutation in Schwann cells leads to severe neuropathy and aerobic glycolysis through a non-cell autonomous effect.,"<i>PIK3CA</i>-related disorders are rare genetic disorders due to somatic gain-of-function mutations in <i>PIK3CA</i> during embryonic development, a pathway involved in cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism. Accumulating evidence from patients with <i>PIK3CA</i>-related disorders indicates that peripheral nerves are frequently affected, leading to severe neurological symptoms. However, the exact underlying mechanism of these disorders remains unclear. To address this, we developed a mouse model with a <i>PIK3CA</i> gain-of-function mutation specifically in Schwann cells, which successfully mirrored the clinical features observed in patients. In this model, we observed that <i>PIK3CA</i>-mutated cells communicate with neighboring healthy cells, such as adipocytes and hair follicles, through a unique crosstalk mechanism that triggers their growth, proliferation, and anagen phase expansion. Additionally, we demonstrated that <i>PIK3CA</i> mutation in peripheral nerves leads to a metabolic shift through glycolytic activation. We investigated the effects of alpelisib, an approved pharmacological inhibitor of PIK3CA, in the model. Early administration of alpelisib significantly improved the signs and symptoms in the mice. However, when treatment was delayed, its efficacy was diminished due to the drug's inability to penetrate the myelin sheath effectively. In summary, our study offers a valuable mouse model for studying <i>PIK3CA</i>-related neuropathy, uncovers a unique communication between healthy and affected tissues, and highlights the potential benefits of early pharmacological intervention using alpelisib.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2025,Quitterie Venot; Marina Firpion; Sophia Ladraa; Charles Bayard; Sato Magassa; Roberta Di Guardo; Antoine Fraissenon; Clément Hoguin; Sanela Protic; Gabriel Morin; Franck Mayeux; Genevieve Gourdon; Sylvie Fraitag; Estelle Balducci; Sophie Kaltenbach; Patrick Villarese; Vahid Asnafi; Thomas Viel; Gwennhael Autret; Bertrand Tavitian; Nicolas Goudin; Laurent Guibaud; Alessandra Bolino; Guillaume Canaud
40553484,Long-Term Multiparameter Sensing Integrated On-Chip Ultrasound for Epileptic Neuron Modulation.,"Ultrasound neuromodulation holds great potential for treating neurological disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its effects remain unclear. There is a lack of systematic safety evaluation and standardized quantification of therapeutic outcomes. To address these challenges, this study integrates on-chip ultrasound with multiparameter cellular monitoring to quantitatively assess the therapeutic effects of various ultrasound parameters on neurological diseases from both electrophysiological and metabolic perspectives. Long-term monitoring is employed for a comprehensive evaluation of ultrasound safety. Notably, the combination of high-resolution, synchronous signal monitoring and biochemical indicators provides a deeper and more thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in ultrasound neuromodulation. Furthermore, using an on-chip epileptic neuron model, it is demonstrated that epileptic neurons exhibit high-frequency firing and synchronized oscillations in excitability, temperature, intracellular calcium, and mitochondrial calcium concentrations. The application of on-chip ultrasound effectively suppresses epileptiform discharges in neurons and inhibits both these oscillations and neuronal bursting events. When tuning with acoustic enhancer sodium valproate-loaded nanobubbles, the antiepileptic therapy effect can be significantly enhanced by maintaining mitochondrial calcium homeostasis. By integrating multiparameter long-term monitoring with on-chip ultrasound, this study presents an advanced approach for investigating the mechanisms of ultrasound neuromodulation, facilitating standardized evaluation and long-term safety assessment.",ACS sensors,2025,Yongxu Ju; Xiao Wang; Yang Liu; Chuan Chen; Fang Yang
40553407,Neuropsychological outcome in pediatric brain tumor survivors treated with proton radiation prior to age 4 years.,"Pediatric brain tumor survivors (PBTS) treated with radiation at a very young age are at risk for adverse neuropsychological outcomes. This retrospective cross-sectional study examined outcomes and educational service utilization in 45 PBTS treated with proton radiation therapy (PRT) before age 4. PBTS and their parents were administered measures at ≥ 1 year post-PRT. Areas assessed: intelligence, emotional, behavioral, adaptive, and executive functioning. Age-based scores were compared to normative means, rates of impairment were calculated, and demographic/clinical factors and educational service utilization were examined. Median age at PRT was 2.58 years. Median interval to follow-up was 2.42 years. All received daily anesthesia during PRT and most received focal PRT (88.9%), had infratentorial tumors (71.1%), received chemotherapy (62.2%), and had sensory/motor deficits (51.1%). All mean standard/T-scores were in the average range. However, mean scores were significantly different from normative data and rates of impairment were notably elevated in withdrawal, anxiety, activities of daily living, shifting, working memory, and adaptive skills. Mean scores and rates of impairment were significantly lower (fewer problems) in aggression and conduct problems. Scores were comparable to the norm in attention, hyperactivity, depression, social skills, inhibition, and emotional control. More than half (62.2%) received special education services/accommodations; patients with sensory/motor deficits received more services/accommodations. Gender, tumor location, chemotherapy, and socioeconomic status were not significantly related to outcome. Neuropsychological outcomes for PBTS treated with PRT before age 4 are encouraging, although there are some areas of concern. Yearly screening, proactive intervention for executive/psychological/adaptive functioning, and special education services/accommodations are recommended.",Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,2025,Tina Thomas; Mary E Witt; Casey L Evans; Julie A Grieco; Torunn I Yock; Margaret B Pulsifer
40553336,Recent Developments in the Application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Early Screening and Diagnosis of Autism.,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD or Autism) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by challenges in social communication skills and the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviors during early childhood. ASD poses a significant public health challenge with increasing prevalence rates worldwide. Early diagnosis and intervention are critical for improving outcomes in children with ASD. However, current diagnostic methods often involve subjective assessments and are time-consuming. Currently, there are no known biomarkers for ASD, and the diagnosis is based on phenotypic manifestations observed by trained clinicians over time. Additionally, the heterogeneity of Autism and associated co-occurring conditions pose further challenges for screening and early detection. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are transforming ASD screening and diagnosis. These computational technologies are capable of analyzing complex datasets and multiple modalities, including multi-omics, brain images, behavior assessments, medical and background information, and registry data to identify patterns that may not be evident to clinicians or parents. This article reviews recent developments in the application of AI/ML for ASD screening and early diagnosis. It also covers the use of AI/ML in understanding the biological underpinnings of ASD.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2025,Shyam Sundar Rajagopalan; Sanjay Ghosh

40553290,An In Vivo Model of Recurrent Glioblastoma.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive and prevalent adult brain tumor. Despite an intensive standard of care consisting of surgical resection followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide, patients invariably succumb to the recurrent tumor and face an overall survival of less than 15 months. Recurrent GBM often differs greatly from the primary counterparts and show greater resistance to genotoxic therapies. Despite these differences and implications this treatment resistance has, recurrent GBM remains relatively understudied due to the paucity of samples and a previous lack of interest in the field. In this chapter, we describe an in vivo xenograft model recapitulating the standard of care with radiation therapy and temozolomide, and the subsequent development of recurrent GBM.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2025,Muhammad Vaseem Shaikh; Benjamin Brakel; Alisha Anand; Chitra Venugopal; Sheila K Singh
40553289,Modeling Glioma Stem Cell-Mediated Tumorigenesis Using Zebrafish Patient-Derived Xenograft Systems.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor associated with high post-therapy recurrence and very poor survival rates. One of the factors contributing to the aggressive nature of this disease is the level of heterogeneity seen at the phenotypic and genetic level. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) are stem-like cells within the tumor with the ability to self-renew and give rise to different types of cells within the tumor, hence giving rise to the heterogeneity found in GBM. GSCs are often implicated in the resistance of glioma to standard of care radiation and chemotherapy. The physical niche within a tumor mass supports stemness and aggressive characteristics of GSCs, hence, experimental systems providing a relevant tumor microenvironment (TME) are critical for adequate assessment of molecular mechanisms regulating GSC populations. Although mouse models continue to be an integral part of an in vivo experimental design, they are neither time- nor cost-efficient. Danio rerio (zebrafish) patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) overcome several of the obstacles of the mammalian systems. Zebrafish constitute a robust, easily reproducible experimental model allowing for relevant investigation of GSC populations with TME. This chapter describes methods required for generation of zebrafish PDXs to study aspects of GSC-mediated tumorigenesis and interactions with the TME.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2025,Hema Priya Mahendran; Alan Cieslukowski; Dorota Lubanska; Nicholas Philbin; Keith F Stringer; Philip Habashy; Mat Stover; Samira Bashiri; Ana C deCarvalho; Mohamed A R Soliman; Abdalla Shamisa; Lisa A Porter

40553287,A Toolkit for Single-Nucleus Characterization of Glioblastoma.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary adult brain tumor. It represents a rapidly evolving ecosystem, including heterogeneous tumor cells and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) with diverse non-malignant cells. High-throughput single-cell omics profiling, such as single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq, respectively), is an emerging powerful tool to deconvolute diverse cell types and states as well as intricate cellular and molecular functions and interactions that underlie the complex GBM ecosystem. snRNA-seq is a methodology that profiles the transcriptome using isolated nuclei instead of intact cells. It is an alternative to scRNA-seq and is compatible with frozen samples and difficult-to-dissociate tissues, such as brain or brain tumor tissues. However, efficient, optimized procedures are instrumental in preparing high-quality single nuclei from clinical GBM specimens and patient-derived GBM cell lines across different conditions for snRNA-seq. Here, we provide a toolkit of detailed protocols for nucleus isolation, counting, and quality control, enabling a streamlined single-nucleus preparation for snRNA-seq characterization.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2025,Cole C Nickason; Vanshika Khaitan; Connor Clark-Baba; Alberto G Torrez; Mikhail Y Salnikov; Kabir Siraj; Solsa Cariba; Fuad Chowdhury; Hong Han

40553281,Patient-Derived Glioblastoma Explants Empower Rapid and Personalized Drug Assessment: Harnessing the Potential of 3D Perfusion Bioreactors in Glioblastoma Drug Discovery.,"Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults, is resistant to Standard of Care (SOC) therapy and almost all available therapies. Clinical trials have not been successful in improving patients' survival, which underscores an urgent need for developing new effective therapies for this treatment-refractory disease. Considering the significant inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity existing in GBM, assessment of therapies in a personalized manner would allow for assigning patients to effective targeted therapies suitable for each patient's unique tumor signature.Patient-tailored ex vivo drug response platform for GBM allows for therapy planning in a personalized manner and enables the discovery of biomarkers of response. Advanced 3D methodologies have shown high efficacy in assessing the effect of therapeutics on intact tumor tissues immediately following tumor resection, allowing for studying the effect of therapies on tumor as a whole followed by detailed analysis of interactions between tumor cells and their microenvironment pre- and post-treatment.Here we describe the use of 3D perfusion bioreactors for translational assessment of therapeutics on regionally annotated patient-derived GBM explants. This model system provides the possibility of generating a 3D dynamic culture with continuous exposure and delivery of drug candidates to an intact tumor tissue material providing crucial insights on treatment-induced mechanisms and facilitating the identification of biomarkers of response, paving the way toward designing and generating more effective therapeutic interventions for GBM patients.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2025,Nazanin Tatari; Manuele G Muraro; Hayget Mohamed Seid Hedad; Gregor Hutter

40553278,Profiling Glioma Stem Cell Dynamics via 3D-Based Cell Cycle Reporter Assays.,"Successful containment of unwanted cell cycle progression in tumors such as glioblastoma (GBM) requires targeted therapeutic approaches, which rely on understanding cell cycle dynamics in response to microenvironmental stimuli. Glioma Stem Cells (GSCs) can drive tumor initiation, recurrence, therapy resistance, and are often attributed to the heterogeneity and plasticity of GBM. In vitro models, using patient-derived GSCs, provide a life relevant tool for exploration of complex molecular mechanisms underlying the aggressive characteristics of GBM. Introduction of 3D tissue culture systems permits the study of spatial complexity of the tumor mass and enables control over diverse conditions within the surrounding microenvironment. This chapter demonstrates detailed methods to study spatiotemporal changes to the cell cycle dynamics using available fluorescent cell cycle reporter systems in combination with bioinformatics-based signal intensity and localization analysis. We present a successful approach that investigates the 3D cell cycle dynamics of GSC populations. This approach utilizes GBM neurosphere and organoid cultures, which are assessed over time and under therapeutic pressure. These models can be further explored, manipulated, and customized to serve specific experimental designs.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2025,Dorota Lubanska; Antonio Roye-Azar; Sami Alrashed; Alan Cieslukowski; Mohamed A R Soliman; Ana C deCarvalho; Abdalla Shamisa; Swati Kulkarni; Lisa A Porter
40553277,O<sup>6</sup>-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) Promoter Methylation Analysis in Glioblastoma Patients.,"The alkylating agent temozolomide is used to treat patients who have glioblastoma. However, treatment is only effective when O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase is silenced in the cancer cells. The best way to assess whether or not a patient will be responsive to treatment is to determine if the promoter region of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene is methylated. Similarly, knowing the methylation status of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter in patient -derived brain tumor initiating cells can help guide research. Here we describe how to determine the methylation status in vitro using bisulfite conversion followed by methylation-specific PCR.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2025,Petar Miletic; Benjamin Brakel; Chitra Venugopal; Sheila K Singh
40553276,Extracellular Flux Assays for the Measurement of Glycolysis and Mitochondrial Respiration in Brain Cancer Cells.,"Several essential biological processes, such as cell growth, survival, and death, are regulated by cellular metabolism. Both normal and cancer cells exhibit metabolic flexibility to adjust to changes in the energy demand in response to alterations in their external microenvironment. This metabolic plasticity is more pronounced in cancer cells, which often reprogram their metabolism to promote their growth and survival. Extracellular flux analysis is a powerful and widely used technique to study cellular metabolism in real time. This approach provides dynamic and functional insights into two key bioenergetic pathways: glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), under both normal and stressed conditions in live cells. In this chapter, we discuss different extracellular flux assays for assessing glycolytic activity, including the glycolysis stress test (GST) and glycolytic rate assay (GRA), as well as OXPHOS using cell mito stress test (MST) with the Agilent Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer. We also highlight key factors to consider for successfully conducting extracellular flux assays.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2025,Kanwaldeep Singh; Tobias Berg
40553275,Synergy Assay for Screening Small Molecule Combinations in Brain Cancer Stem Cells.,"Brain tumors are among the most heterogeneous tumors characterized. This heterogeneity drives resistance to single-drug therapies, making combination treatment a more promising approach to improve treatment outcomes. To optimize drug combinations and guide treatment development in this new era of combinatorial therapy, methods for quantifying synergistic, additive or antagonistic interactions between treatments are needed. In this chapter, we describe an in vitro assay to identify synergistic drug combinations in brain-tumor-derived cell cultures. As the gold-standard assay for the in vitro evaluation of drug combination efficacy, this protocol is a fast, inexpensive, and highly reproducible method for identifying and validating synergistic drug combinations.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2025,Benjamin Brakel; Iqra Chaudhry; Chitra Venugopal; Sheila K Singh

40553272,Embryonic Stem Cell Models of Human Brain Tumors.,"Utilization of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as a model system to study highly malignant pediatric cancers has led to significant insight into the molecular mechanisms governing tumor progression and has revealed novel therapeutic targets for these devastating diseases. Here, we describe our method for previously generating heterogeneous populations of neural precursors from both normal and neoplastic hESCs and the subsequent injection of neoplastic human embryonic neural cells (hENs) into intracerebellar xenograft models. Histopathologically, neural tumors derived from neoplastic hENs exhibit features similar to more aggressive medulloblastoma, the most common malignant primary pediatric brain tumor. In this chapter, we will outline the detailed methods for culturing normal and neoplastic neural precursor cells in both adherent and tumorsphere formats and the full characterization of the brain tumors generated from these cells in nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD SCID) mice.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2025,Ludivine Coudière Morrison; Nazanin Tatari; Tamra Werbowetski-Ogilvie
40553271,Isolation and Propagation of Brain Tumor Stem Cells.,"Shortly after the discovery of cancer stem cells in acute myeloid leukemia, cancer stem cells in several cancer types were discovered, including brain cancer. Brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs), initially characterized by the expression of CD133, are a population of cells that can proliferate and form spheres in vitro and form tumors in vivo. Due to the belief that they are treatment-resistant and seed-recurrent diseases, they are an ideal preclinical model that can be used to study brain cancer. In this chapter, we describe how to process, maintain, and propagate a BTSC culture from brain tumor tissue samples.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2025,Anish Puri; Chitra Venugopal; Sheila K Singh
40553270,Brain Tumor Stem Cells: New Perspectives.,"Brain cancer remains to be one of the most formidable challenges in oncology, due to its complexity, heterogeneity, and aggressive nature. Despite advances in treatment, many patients continue to face poor prognoses, underscoring the dire need for ongoing research and innovation to address this clinical enigma. Brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs) have shown to play a significant factor in the transformation and progression of brain tumors. This distinct subpopulation of cancer cells exhibit key characteristics remnant of neural stem cells (NSCs) including self-renewal and asymmetric differentiation. They are also characterized by abhorrent signaling pathways, metabolic processes, and immune surveillance. Current methods utilize fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FAC) methods to isolate and enrich for BTSCs based on cell surface markers. In this chapter, we review the current challenges in BTSC research, highlighting the anomalies of BTSCs and their surrounding niche that lead to therapeutic resistance and relapse. Current and prospective research are explored to address these challenges, including innovative technologies such as single cell RNA sequencing captures genetic and transcriptomic information on the single-cell level. Screening methods utilizing CRISPR technology are discussed to identify targetable vulnerabilities. Finally, with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), current research utilizing AI and machine learning are explored to introduce novel therapeutic targets and improved diagnostic tools.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2025,Alisha Anand; Chitra Venugopal; Sheila K Singh
40553242,Specificities of Mental Functioning and Referential Process in Body Dysmorphic Disorder: A Single Case Study Using the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual (PDM-2).,"This study aimed to accurately diagnose a patient with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) and explore challenges to symbolization in the early and middle stages of psychotherapy through an analysis of language used by both therapist and patient. The patient was assessed using the Psychodynamic Chart in the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual and the Referential Process language measures, which were applied to the early and middle treatment sessions. At the beginning of treatment, the patient presented with comorbid somatizing and schizoid personality disorders, and strong obsessive and anxiety-avoidant traits. He displayed significant impairments in capacity for mentalization; affective range; communication and understanding; self-esteem regulation; and relational intimacy. The patient met criteria for severe BDD. His speech showed a markedly abstract and intellectualized linguistic style that indicated great difficulty in connecting emotional experience to images and words. The therapist's interventions were adapted to this style and were characterized by continuous prompts and suggestions aimed at linking elements and supporting a symbolizing process in order to integrate emotional activation in narratives. This therapeutic action, which we labeled ""aided symbolization"" promoted a slow but significant process of change with improvement in overall mental functioning. The clinical implications of these results are discussed.",Journal of psycholinguistic research,2025,Christopher Christian; Alice Fiorini Bincoletto; Rachele Mariani; Attà Negri; Vittorio Lingiardi; Annalisa Tanzilli
40553232,A multi-domain lifestyle intervention in multiple sclerosis: a longitudinal observational study.,"To examine the effects of a multi-domain lifestyle intervention that advocated a Mediterranean style diet, and concurrently targeted physical activity, stress and sleep, on multiple sclerosis. A longitudinal observational study investigating the effect of a multi-domain lifestyle intervention (i.e., diet, exercise, stress, and sleep management) at four timepoints: start run-in, start and stop 3-month intensive interval, and 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome (i.e., impact of multiple sclerosis on daily functioning) and secondary outcomes (i.e., quality of life, general health, multiple sclerosis-specific symptoms, and lifestyle factors) were analyzed using mixed models. Analyses were repeated among subgroups based on program compliance, body mass index, education level, and multiple sclerosis-subtype. Out of 668 participants, 579 were included (age 46.2 ± 10.5 years, 84.5% women, and 71% relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis). The impact of multiple sclerosis on physical functioning remained stable during the run-in period, but reduced significantly from baseline to both post-intervention (β = -2.50 [-3.40, -1.60]) and to 3-month follow-up (β = -2.00 [-2.93, -1.07]). The impact of multiple sclerosis on mental functioning decreased significantly across all time periods (run-in β = 1.86 [0.78, 2.94], post-intervention β = -3.48 [-4.58, -2.39], and 3-month follow-up β = -2.44 [-3.56, 1.31]). Effect size was greatest among participants with higher compliance, lower education, and obesity. The lifestyle program was associated with reduced impact of multiple sclerosis on daily functioning, multiple sclerosis-related symptoms, mental quality of life, and general health determinants. Future randomized trials are needed to establish causal effects of lifestyle adjustments on multiple sclerosis.",Journal of neurology,2025,Ilse M Nauta; Keeva N M Loughlin; Arianne S Gravesteijn; Jade van Wegen; Rosa P Hofman; Nathalie Wilmsen; Emma Coles; Zoé L E van Kempen; Joep Killestein; Bob W van Oosten; Eva M M Strijbis; Bernard M J Uitdehaag; Brigit A de Jong
40553228,Postoperative outcomes in mitochondrial myopathy-associated ptosis: a case series.,"To determine the anatomical and functional success and complication rates after surgical treatment in cases of mitochondrial myopathy (MM) with ptosis and how the complications that develop may be managed. Patients who underwent surgical correction due to ptosis between October 2010 and January 2020 and diagnosed with MM on muscle biopsy were retrospectively analyzed. The margin reflex distance 1 (MRD1) values of the patients were evaluated preoperatively, postoperative 1st week, 1st month, 6th month and 12th month. The complications that developed during the follow-ups and their management were examined. The study included 64 eyes of 34 patients. In all patients, the MRD1 value at 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months after the surgery showed a significant increase compared to the preoperative value (p < 0.05). Lagophthalmic keratitis developed in 1 eye (1.56%) that underwent levator resection and healed without sequelae. In 1 eye (1.56%) that underwent silicone frontal sling, lagophthalmic keratitis and inferior corneal ulcer developed, healed with minimal corneal haze and did not affect visual acuity. A corneal ulcer developed in 1 eye (1.56%) that underwent levator resection 12 months later due to insufficient lubricant treatment and healed with minimal corneal haze without causing vision loss with frequent topical lubricant and topical antibiotics. One of the two patients who underwent levator resection had ptosis progression in one eye after 18 months and the other in one eye after 24 months. Surgical revision was not required. Complications related to lagophthalmos may be prevented with the appropriate patient and surgical method selection and frequent postoperative observation.

40553207,Depression after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: development of a screening tool and discharge user interface.,"A method for identification of chronic depression after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), risk stratification, and counseling is needed. This study aimed to develop a scoring system for post-aSAH depression and a user interface to supplement discharge counseling for patients. Based on a published prediction model for posttreatment depression risk among aSAH patients, a scale was developed using the beta coefficients of the final predictive model. The 5-point scale was based on 4 characteristics: tobacco use (2 points), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1 point), diabetes (1 point), and nonsaccular aneurysm type (1 point). A score of 1 was defined as low risk, a score of 2 or 3 was defined as medium risk, and a score of 4 or 5 was defined as high risk. The scale was then validated in a cohort of 514 patients treated at a single center. An interactive application was developed. The rate of posttreatment depression among aSAH patients was 29.6% (152 of 514). The low-risk group had a nonsignificant increase in depression risk (relative risk [RR] [95% CI] = 0.89 [0.59-1.33], p = 0.71) compared with those with a score of 0. Significant increases in depression risk were found in the medium-risk (RR [95% CI] = 1.78 [1.34-2.37], p < 0.001) and high-risk (RR [95% CI] = 2.29 [1.28-4.09], p < 0.001) groups. A substantial percentage of patients in our cohort experienced major depressive disorder symptoms after aSAH treatment. An easy-to-use prediction and risk stratification tool for posttreatment depression among aSAH patients is available.",Acta neurochirurgica,2025,Stefan W Koester; Brandon K Hoglund; Joelle N Hartke; Robert F Rudy; Ashutosh P Jadhav; Andrew F Ducruet; Felipe C Albuquerque; Joshua S Catapano; Laura A Snyder; Michael T Lawton
40553205,Comprehensive predictive modeling in subarachnoid hemorrhage: integrating radiomics and clinical variables.,"Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a severe condition with high morbidity and long-term neurological consequences. Radiomics, by extracting quantitative features from Computed Tomograhpy (CT) scans, may reveal imaging biomarkers predictive of outcomes. This study evaluates the predictive value of radiomics in SAH for multiple outcomes and compares its performance to models based on clinical data.Radiomic features were extracted from admission CTs using segmentations of brain tissue (white and gray matter) and hemorrhage. Machine learning models with cross-validation were trained using clinical data, radiomics, or both, to predict 6-month mortality, Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), vasospasm, and long-term hydrocephalus. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was used to interpret feature contributions.The training dataset included 403 aneurysmal SAH patients; GOS predictions used all patients, while vasospasm and hydrocephalus predictions excluded those with incomplete data or early death, leaving 328 and 332 patients, respectively. Radiomics and clinical models demonstrated comparable performance, achieving in validation set AUCs more than 85% for six-month mortality and clinical outcome, and 75% and 86% for vasospasm and hydrocephalus, respectively. In an independent cohort of 41 patients, the combined models yielded AUCs of 89% for mortality, 87% for clinical outcome, 66% for vasospasm, and 72% for hydrocephalus. SHAP analysis highlighted significant contributions of radiomic features from brain tissue and hemorrhage segmentation, alongside key clinical variables, in predicting SAH outcomes.This study underscores the potential of radiomics-based approaches for SAH outcome prediction, demonstrating predictive power comparable to traditional clinical models and enhancing understanding of SAH-related complications.Clinical trial number Not applicable.",Neurosurgical review,2025,Gemma Urbanos; Ana M Castaño-León; Mónica Maldonado-Luna; Elena Salvador; Ana Ramos; Carmen Lechuga; César Sanz; Eduardo Juárez; Alfonso Lagares
40553197,Unveiling mysteries of aging: the potential of melatonin in preventing neurodegenerative diseases in older adults.,"Neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, result in a substantial health problem for the elderly, marked by ongoing neuronal degeneration and a deterioration in mental faculties. These disorders are frequently linked to oxidative stress, problems with mitochondria, and persistent inflammation in the brain, which worsen neuronal damage. The neurohormone melatonin, primarily secreted by the pineal gland, has gained recognition as a promising therapeutic agent due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. Melatonin's functions extend beyond its regulation of circadian rhythms, as research has demonstrated its ability to remove free radicals, improve mitochondrial performance, and adjust immune system responses, ultimately reducing the progression of neurodegenerative disease. Research findings from preclinical and clinical trials imply that taking melatonin supplements could lead to improved cognitive abilities, slower disease progression, and an overall better quality of life for elderly individuals suffering from neurodegenerative conditions. The mechanisms through which melatonin acts, the best dosage, and its long-term effectiveness are still being researched. This review underscores the potential benefits of melatonin as a supplementary treatment for neurodegenerative disorders in older adults, stressing the necessity for additional studies to confirm its efficacy and standardize its use in treatment plans.",Biogerontology,2025,Omer Unal; Nilufer Akgun-Unal; Abdulkerim Kasim Baltaci
40553196,Impact of sleep bruxism on oral health-related quality of life in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize evidence on the impact of sleep bruxism on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in children. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science, without language restrictions. Observational studies evaluating the association between sleep bruxism and OHRQoL in children (aged 0-12 years) were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Analytical Cross-Sectional Studies. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models. Studies not eligible for meta-analysis were described narratively. Eight studies were included in the systematic review, and four in the meta-analysis, encompassing data from 968 children. Meta-analysis demonstrated that sleep bruxism was significantly associated with impaired OHRQoL (OR = 1.99; 95% CI: 1.09-3.65), with greater impacts observed in the symptom (MD = 0.43; 95% CI: 0.17-0.69) and functional domains (MD = 1.00; 95% CI: 0.08-1.92). No significant association was observed for family-related outcomes (OR = 1.87; 95% CI: 0.60-5.82). Among studies not included in the meta-analysis, findings were inconsistent, highlighting methodological variability. Sleep bruxism adversely affects children's OHRQoL, especially in domains related to symptoms and functional limitations. These findings highlight the need for early identification and individualized management to mitigate its impact. Longitudinal studies are warranted to elucidate causality and assess broader psychosocial outcomes.",Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung,2025,Milena Andrade Araújo Costa; Raquel Souza Marques; Marilia Leão Goettems; Flávio Fernando Demarco; Paulo Ricardo Martins-Filho
40553176,Quantitative cervical cord MRI in spinal muscular atrophy: a sensitive imaging biomarker of disease evolution and treatment.,"Nusinersen is an approved disease-modifying therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a rare neuromuscular disease characterized by degeneration of alpha motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord (SC), leading to progressive muscle atrophy and weakness. This exploratory study investigated the potential of quantitative SC magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a biomarker for monitoring treatment-related changes in pediatric and adult SMA patients treated with nusinersen at different disease stages. Five pediatric and three adult SMA patients underwent clinical assessments, including the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) and Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), along with SC MRI at multiple time points (TPs) during nusinersen treatment. At each TP, total cross-sectional area (TCA), grey matter area (GM<sub>area</sub>), and magnetization transfer saturation (MT<sub>sat</sub>) were measured at multiple cervical SC levels. All pediatric patients showed a progressive increase in SC TCA and GM<sub>area</sub> over time, paralleled by improvements in HFMSE and RULM scores. In contrast, adult patients exhibited stable SC MRI measures with modest functional gains. MT<sub>sat</sub> values remained largely stable across time points, with a mild decrease observed at TP5. TCA and GM<sub>area</sub> showed positive association trends with clinical scales. Nusinersen showed beneficial effects in both adult and pediatric SMA patients, with more marked improvements in children. Quantitative SC MRI metrics, especially TCA and GM<sub>area</sub>, reflected clinical trends and may serve as non-invasive biomarkers for monitoring treatment effects, pending validation in larger cohorts.",Journal of neurology,2025,C Asteggiano; L Mazzocchi; L Farina; M Paoletti; L Barzaghi; E Caverzasi; S Parravicini; M I Dainesi; A Gardani; G Savini; N Bergsland; E Ballante; C A M Gandini Wheeler-Kingshott; A Berardinelli; A Pichiecchio
40553164,Effect of lemborexant on sleep-wake state discrepancy in participants with insomnia disorder.,"The efficacy of hypnotic drugs for sleep-wake state discrepancy remains unclear. This study evaluated the efficacy of lemborexant in improving sleep-wake state discrepancy in insomnia disorder and its associations with sleep quality and daytime functioning. Twenty-nine participants diagnosed with insomnia disorder were treated with lemborexant for 12 weeks. Objective sleep parameters were measured using a home electroencephalography device, and subjective parameters were obtained from electronic sleep diaries. Sleep-wake state discrepancy indices, including discrepancies of sleep onset latency (disSOL), wake after sleep onset (disWASO), total sleep time (disTST), and sleep efficiency (disSE), were calculated as objective minus subjective sleep parameters. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were used to assess sleep quality and daytime sleepiness. Linear mixed-effects models were used for data analysis. Both subjective and objective sleep parameters were improved at 12 weeks after lemborexant administration. The disTST decreased significantly at 4 and 12 weeks. The disSOL increased and disSE decreased significantly by 12 weeks. Participants with defined sleep-wake state discrepancy (disTST > 0 min) showed greater decreases in these indices, whereas minimal changes were observed in those without. The disWASO did not change significantly among baseline and 4 and 12 weeks. The improvement in disTST demonstrated a significant association with the reduction of ESS scores (p = 0.008), whereas there was no substantial effect on PSQI scores. The present findings suggest that lemborexant treatment reduces sleep-wake state discrepancy, which may be associated with improved daytime functioning in patients with insomnia disorder.",Psychopharmacology,2025,Kent Naito; Kunihiro Iwamoto; Seiko Miyata; Ippei Okada; Keita Kawai; Akihiro Fujimoto; Yuki Kogo; Daisuke Mori; Nao Matsuyama; Masahiko Ando; Norio Ozaki; Masashi Ikeda
40553123,Suicide in subjects under the age of 30: a retrospective analysis.,"Suicide represents one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Rates seem to be decreasing, but we are still far from a desirable reduction of the phenomenon. Data on younger members of the population, seasonal variability, and changes in the post-pandemic period are still limited. The purpose of the study was to assess the incidence and characteristics of suicides in individuals under the age of 30 who underwent autopsy in a metropolitan area. Autopsy cases from the last 32 years were analysed considering age, sex, date of death, method of suicide, cause of death, presence of mental disorders, drug and alcohol abuse, previous suicide attempts and previously expressed suicidal intention. There were 699 cases of suicide, of which 9.3% were minors. Violent methods were the most used, consistent with their easy availability and effectiveness.

40553109,Matrix metalloproteinase-triggered self-assembling peptides for biomedical applications.,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play critical roles in numerous physiological processes and are essential for various fundamental biological activities. Alterations in their expression levels have been associated with multiple diseases and pathological conditions. The self-assembly of small-molecule peptides into hydrogels and nanomaterials has been widely investigated for its various biomedical applications. MMPs can trigger enzyme-instructed assemblies of peptides with specific sequences to form various hydrogels for potential applications in treating several diseases, including cancer, inflammation, wound healing, myocardial infarction, and central nervous system disease, and in tissue engineering. In addition, MMPs can also trigger the self-assembly of peptides into a variety of nanostructures tailored on demand, especially serving as indicators and activators to increase their functionality in sensing applications and controlled substance release, acting as primitive biological triggers, modulating biological responses, ensuring the targeted delivery of biomolecules to specific locations, and inducing changes in the self-assembled peptide nanostructures by introducing enzyme cleavage site recognition sequences to release loaded drugs, which is crucial for applications in hydrogels and nanomaterials. This review summarizes and highlights the successful applications of various MMP-triggered self-assembled peptide hydrogels and nanostructures over the past decade and emphasizes their potential for controlled drug delivery, targeted therapy, and intelligent biomaterial-assisted wound regeneration and healing. Furthermore, future opportunities and challenges in this field are reviewed.",Journal of materials chemistry. B,2025,Zhuyun Liu; Chunlin Yu; Zhenjia Li; Xiaorui Wang; Dejing Shang; Weibing Dong
40553100,Language comprehension assessment using the computer-based instrument for low motor language testing (C-BiLLT) in children with Angelman syndrome.,"Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder with intellectual disability, limited to no speech development, epilepsy, motor deficits, and behavioral issues. Children with AS generally demonstrate better language comprehension than expressive language skills, but language comprehension is difficult to measure since commonly used tests rely on fine motor skills and/or require a certain level of intellectual functioning. The Computer-Based instrument for Low motor Language Testing (C-BiLLT) was developed to assess language comprehension in non-speaking children with motor impairments. This study assessed the feasibility, construct validity and sensitivity of the C-BiLLT in a clinical cohort of 65 children with AS (2 to 19 years old). All participants successfully finished the test, without floor or ceiling effects. The C-BiLLT showed good construct validity, reflected by a significant correlation with the Bayley language comprehension subscale and with related constructs (expressive language measured by the Communication Matrix and the Bayley cognition subscale). C-BiLLT scores were associated with age. Finally, the C-BiLLT was sensitive to differentiate between AS genotypes. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the C-BiLLT is a feasible, valid and sensitive measurement instrument for language comprehension in children with AS. We recommend using the C-BiLLT in clinical practice and in scientific research.","Augmentative and alternative communication (Baltimore, Md. : 1985)",2025,Cindy Navis; Doesjka A Hagenaar; Karen G C B Bindels-de Heus; Marc P van der Schroeff; Johanna J M Geytenbeek; Marie-Claire Y de Wit

We focused on assessing the levels of two proteins associated with neurogeneration, namely CNTF (ciliary neurotrophic factor) and TIMP1 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1), in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of GBS patients. Measurements were taken prior to and following the second week of illness. We found that the increase in CNTF and TIMP1, as determined by the ratio of post-2nd week CNTF levels to pre-2nd week CNTF levels, exhibited a positive correlation with improvements in the Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score at both 4 weeks and 6 months. Based on these findings, we conclude that both CNTF and TIMP1 can serve as valuable prognostic biomarkers in GBS.",Neurology India,2025,Sridhar Amalakanti; Kesava V R Arepalli; Jyothi P Jillella
40553061,Isolated Abducens Nerve Palsies from COVID-19 Infections: Clinical Features and Outcomes.,"Isolated abducens nerve palsies from COVID-19 infections are rarely described in literature. Their clinical features are poorly understood, and guidance on their treatment is lacking. To describe the clinical features of isolated abducens nerve palsies from COVID-19 infection, and provide guidance on their management. We performed a literature review and analyzed the clinical features of patients with isolated abducens nerve palsy from COVID-19 infections reported in literature. In total, 16 cases from 15 studies published between January 2020 and December 2023 were identified. Their median age was 44 years (range 3-71, including two children). Nearly two-thirds (10/16, 63%) were without medical history. Abducens nerve palsies mostly occurred early with COVID-19 symptoms (median of 5.5 days, range 0-21 days). They were all unilateral, and displayed neither clear gender nor left-right predilections. Brain magnetic resonance imaging scans were often unremarkable (9/13, 69%). More than half (9/16, 56%) received no treatment or symptomatic treatment only, while only two received steroids. Regardless, nearly all experienced clinical of diplopia (14/16, 88%), of which most recovery were either complete or near-complete (at least 10/14, 71%) within a median period of 26 days (range 5-240 days). Isolated abducens nerve palsies are early but uncommon complications of COVID-19, mainly affecting patients with mild infections. Prognosis appears fair even when without corticosteroid treatment, and recovery is significant and early in most. Observation and early outpatient clinical review within a month are reasonable measures. Patients without significant improvement within a month should be re-assessed for other aetiologies.",Neurology India,2025,You-Jiang Tan; Shawn Zhen-Ji Lin
40553060,Cerebellum-Predominant Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy: An Under-recognized Cause of Cerebellar Syndrome among People with Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection.,"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PMLE) is caused by severe cortical demyelination due to reactivation of the polyomavirus, JC virus in profound immunosuppression, like advanced HIV infection. Cerebellum-predominant PMLE is rare and underreported. We report seven patients with confirmed cerebellum-predominant PMLE from a quaternary care center in South India over a five-year period. We report their outcomes and disability using modified Rankin scores (mRS). All seven patients had advanced HIV infection with low CD4 counts [median (IQR) 79 (51-155) cells/μL]. Ataxia (5/7; 71.4%), dysarthria (4/7; 57.1%), and vertigo (2/7; 28.5%) were the common symptoms at presentation. Cerebellar hemisphere or cerebellar peduncles with or without brainstem involvement were noted in all patients. Concomitant supratentorial involvement was also present in six patients. 'Shrimp sign' was seen in five of the seven patients. Only one patient had significant neurological recovery on follow-up. Cerebellum predominant PMLE is a severe, disabling opportunistic infection among patients with advanced HIV infection.",Neurology India,2025,Selwyn Selva Kumar; Priyanka Gautam; Harshad Arvind Vanjare; P Prasanna Kumar; Asha Mary Abraham; Rajiv Karthik; Abi Manesh
40553056,A transdiagnostic examination of sex- and race and ethnicity-based mental health treatment disparities among publicly insured youth.,"Low-income, publicly insured youth face numerous barriers to adequate mental health care, which may be compounded for those with multiple marginalized identities. However, no research has examined how identity and diagnosis may interact to shape the treatment experiences of under-resourced youth with psychiatric conditions. Applying an intersectional lens to treatment disparities is essential for developing targeted interventions to promote equitable care. Analyses included youth ages 7-18 with eating disorders (EDs; <i>n</i> = 3,311), mood/anxiety disorders (<i>n</i> = 3,219), or psychotic disorders (<i>n</i> = 3,035) enrolled in California Medicaid. Using state billing records, we examined sex- and race and ethnicity-based disparities in receipt of core services - outpatient therapy, outpatient medical care, and inpatient treatment - in the first year after diagnosis and potential differences across diagnostic groups. Many youth (50.7% across diagnoses) received no outpatient therapy, and youth with EDs were least likely to receive these services. Youth of color received fewer days of outpatient therapy than White youth, and Latinx youth received fewer therapy and medical services across outpatient and inpatient contexts. Sex- and race and ethnicity-based disparities were especially pronounced for youth with EDs, with particularly low levels of service receipt among boys and Latinx youth with EDs. Results raise concerns for unmet treatment needs among publicly insured youth, which are exacerbated for youth with multiple marginalized identities and those who do not conform to historical stereotypes of affected individuals (e.g., low-income boys of color with EDs). Targeted efforts are needed to ensure equitable care.",Psychological medicine,2025,Erin C Accurso; Megan E Mikhail; Kate Duggento Cordell; Amanda E Downey; Lonnie R Snowden
40553041,The causal effect of smoking on psychiatric disorders: an examination of brain volume as a potential pathway.,"There is growing evidence that smoking increases the risk of developing psychiatric disorders, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. We examine brain structure as a potential pathway between smoking and psychiatric disease liability. We test associations between smoking (initiation, cigarettes per day, cessation, lifetime use) and depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, with and without correcting for volume of the amygdala, hippocampus, lateral and medial orbitofrontal cortex, superior frontal context, and cortical thickness and surface area. We use three methods that use summary statistics of genome-wide association studies to investigate genome-wide and local genetic overlap (genomic structural equation modeling, local analysis of (co)variant association), as well as causal associations (Mendelian randomization). While we find causal effects of smoking on brain volume in different brain areas, and with psychiatric disorders, brain volume did not seem to mediate the effect of smoking on psychiatric disorders. While these findings are limited by characteristics of the included summary statistics (e.g. sample size), we conclude that brain volume of these areas is unlikely to explain a substantial part of any effect of smoking on psychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, genetic methods are valuable tools for exploring other potential mechanisms, such as brain functional connectivity, foregoing the need to collect all phenotypes in one dataset.",Psychological medicine,2025,Margot P van de Weijer; Shu Liu; Anaïs B Thijssen; Robyn E Wootton; Adrià Túnez; Jentien M Vermeulen; Guido van Wingen; Dirk J A Smit; Marcus Munafò; Karin J H Verweij; Jorien L Treur
40553012,Prenatal Antiretroviral Exposure and Concomitant Neurodevelopmental Problems among 5-year-old Children who are HIV-Exposed and Uninfected.,"Atazanavir (ATV) has been a preferred protease inhibitor prescribed to pregnant women with HIV, often given with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine. Studies have reported associations of prenatal exposure to ATV with early neurodevelopmental problems among children HIV-exposed but uninfected (CHEU). Prospective US-based multisite cohort study of CHEU. Monolingual English-speaking CHEU from the Surveillance Monitoring for ART Toxicities study were evaluated for cognition, language and behavior at age 5 years. Exploratory factor analyses using ten composite scores were performed to estimate underlying factors reflecting covariation of these domains. Mean differences of standardized factor scores were compared between CHEU exposed to TDF/emtricitabine with/without ATV versus zidovudine/lamivudine without ATV using linear generalized estimating equations, adjusting for confounders and accounting for clustering by site. Separate analyses were conducted by timing of maternal ART initiation (pre-conception versus post-conception). 585 CHEU were exposed to TDF/emtricitabine with/without ATV, or zidovudine/lamivudine without ATV, and had valid composite scores. Two factors were identified, explaining 27-88% variability of individual composite scores. Factor 1 contributed to cognitive and language domains; Factor 2 contributed to the behavioral domain. Differences in factor scores among ART exposure groups were not observed for cognition/language, but CHEU exposed to TDF/emtricitabine with/without ATV had worse behavioral functioning factor scores compared to zidovudine/lamivudine without ATV in the post-conception strata, especially for those exposed to TDF/emtricitabine/ATV when ARVs were initiated in trimester 1. Prenatal exposure to TDF/emtricitabine/atazanavir was associated with factor scores reflecting parent-reported behavioral concerns among CHEU whose mothers initiated ARVs during pregnancy.",Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999),2025,Tzy-Jyun Yao; Joel Zhang; Kathleen Malee; Renee Smith; Mabel L Rice; Sean M Redmond; Paige L Williams
40552999,A Data-Centric Approach to Deep Learning for Brain Metastasis Analysis at MRI.,"Background With the increasing incidence of brain metastases (BMs), artificial intelligence models have shown promise in assisting with the detection and volumetric analysis of lesions at MRI. However, current models are limited in identifying small lesions and lack generalizability. Purpose To develop a generalizable deep learning system for detecting, segmenting, and longitudinally tracking BMs of any size at MRI. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, a data-centric approach to deep learning model development was used. A multicenter dataset was collected, comprising pre- and/or posttreatment MRI scans from patients with BMs and MRI scans from patients with cancer without BMs (December 2015 to August 2023). Iterative data annotation by radiologists with systematic quality control increased the consistency of reference segmentations. A modified nnU-Net framework, with robust data preprocessing and augmentation, was used. Lesion-wise detection metrics and segmentation performance, Dice similarity coefficient, and normalized surface distance were evaluated. Results In total, 1985 scans from 1623 patients (mean age, 62.0 years ± 12.2 [SD]; 743 female patients, 157 patients of unknown sex), with 5552 BMs, were included. BMs were present in 64.8% of the scans (1286 of 1985), 36.0% (463 of 1286) of which were posttreatment scans. The model was trained on 1451 scans acquired on 30 different scanners. In internal testing (<i>n</i> = 223), sensitivity was 98.0% (95% CI: 96.3, 99.0; 449 of 458 lesions). In external testing (<i>n</i> = 311), sensitivity was 97.4% (95% CI: 96.2, 98.2; 935 of 960; <i>P</i> = .58), with a mean of 0.6 false positives per patient. The sensitivity remained high for all lesion sizes, including those less than 3 mm in diameter (93.3% [95% CI: 89.1, 96.0]; 196 of 210). Median Dice similarity coefficient was 0.89 and 0.90 for the internal and external test datasets, respectively (<i>P</i> = .13). Median normalized surface distance was 0.99 for both datasets. Conclusion The deep learning system demonstrated high performance and generalizability in detecting and segmenting BMs of all sizes on pre- and posttreatment MRI scans. © RSNA, 2025 <i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i>",Radiology,2025,Laurens Topff; Liliana Petrychenko; Neeraj Jain; Sara Lingier; Jeroen Bertels; Patricio Astudillo; Milan Prosec; Pablo Menéndez Fernández-Miranda; Olivier Gevaert; Marion Smits; Sophie Derks; Eline Verhaak; Patrick E J Hanssens; Enrique Marco de Lucas; Rodrigo Sutil; Pablo D Dominguez; Adina Negoita; Ernst Visser; David Corral Fontecha; Loes M M Braun; Dieta Brandsma; Jacob J Visser; Erik R Ranschaert; Kevin B W Groot Lipman; Regina G H Beets-Tan
40552996,Modulation of Cortical and Hippocampal Functional MRI Connectivity Following Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation in Mild Alzheimer Disease.,"Background Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) may be effective for improving cognitive function in Alzheimer disease (AD), but its impact on brain functional connectivity (FC) has not been well studied. Purpose To evaluate tACS efficacy in improving cognitive performance and modulating FC between brain regions in individuals with AD using functional MRI. Materials and Methods In this prospective randomized controlled trial (September 2020 to April 2022), participants with mild AD were assigned to active (40 Hz tACS with 15-mA intensity) or sham (no γ frequency or current) tACS groups for 3 weeks (referred to as week 3), with a 3-month follow-up (referred to as month 3). Functional MRI and cognitive testing were performed at baseline, week 3, and month 3. Primary outcomes were changes in Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores from baseline to week 3. Secondary outcomes included FC changes within multiple cortical networks and between cortex and hippocampus from baseline to week 3 and month 3, assessed using Fisher <i>z</i>-transformed correlation coefficient (hereafter, <i>z</i> score). Results Forty-six participants were randomized into the active group (<i>n</i> = 23; median age, 66 years; IQR, 62-69 years; 16 female participants) or the sham group (<i>n</i> = 23; mean age, 64 years; IQR, 61-69 years; 14 female participants). The active group had higher Mini-Mental State Examination (median score change, 2 [IQR, 1-5] vs 0 [IQR, -1 to 2]; <i>P</i> = .001) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (median score change, 2 [IQR, 0-4] vs 0 [IQR, -1 to 2]; <i>P</i> = .03) scores than the sham group at week 3, respectively. Compared with the sham group, the active group had increased FC between left hippocampus and left middle cingulate gyrus (<i>z</i> score difference, 0.29; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.42; false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted <i>P</i> < .001) and between the left hippocampus and the left middle frontal gyrus (<i>z</i> score difference, 0.16; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.29; FDR-adjusted <i>P</i> = .04) within the posterior default-mode network (<i>z</i> score difference, 0.40; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.73; FDR-adjusted <i>P</i> = .046) and within the visual network (<i>z</i> score difference, 0.45; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.73; FDR-adjusted <i>P</i> = .007) from baseline to week 3. Conclusion Cognitive performance in mild AD improved following tACS, with increased FC within cortical networks and between the hippocampus and specific cortical regions.

40552972,Progression of clinical diagnostic features and cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies.,"Mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB) may be identified prospectively based on the presence of cognitive impairment and several core clinical features (visual hallucinations, cognitive fluctuations, parkinsonism, and REM sleep behavior disorder). MCI-LB may vary in its presenting features, which may reflect differences in underlying pathological pattern, severity, or comorbidity.We aimed to assess how clinical features of MCI-LB accumulate over time, and whether this is associated with the rate of cognitive decline. In this cohort study, 74 individuals seen with MCI-LB prospectively underwent repeated annual cognitive and clinical assessment up to nine years. Relationships between clinical features (number of core features present and specific features present) and cognitive change on the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R) were examined with time-varying mixed models. The accumulation of core clinical features over time was examined with a multi-state Markov model. When an individual with MCI-LB endorsed more clinical features, they typically experienced a faster cognitive decline (ACE-R Score Difference β = -1.1 [-1.7 to -0.5]), specifically when experiencing visual hallucinations (β = -2.1 [-3.5 to -0.8]) or cognitive fluctuations (β = -3.4 [-4.8 to -2.1]).Individuals with MCI-LB typically acquired more clinical features with the passage of time (25.5% [20.0-32.0%] one-year probability), limiting the prognostic utility of baseline-only features. The clinical presentation of MCI-LB may evolve over time. The accumulation of more clinical features of Lewy body disease, in particular visual hallucinations and cognitive fluctuations, may be associated with a worse prognosis in clinical settings.",Psychological medicine,2025,Calum Alexander Hamilton; Paul C Donaghy; John-Paul Taylor; Joanna Ciafone; Rory Durcan; Michael Firbank; Gemma Greenfinch; Louise Allan; John O'Brien; Alan Thomas
40552959,Polyalanine Expansion in PABPN1 Alters the Structure and Dynamics of Its Nuclear Aggregates in Differentiated Muscle Cells.,"Intracellular protein aggregation is a hallmark of aging and contributes to pathology in some age-associated diseases. In hereditary adult-onset neuromuscular diseases (NMDs), protein aggregates play a key role in disease onset and progression. The wild-type Poly(A) binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) forms benign nuclear aggregates, whereas a short trinucleotide expansion leads to the formation of pathogenic aggregates, a hallmark of Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy (OPMD). In OPMD, the mutant PABPN1 causes skeletal muscle weakness. So far, the structural differences between benign and pathogenic protein aggregates and their effects on muscle cell biology remain poorly understood. We employed an array of advanced imaging modalities to explore the morphological differences between nuclear aggregates formed by non-pathogenic and pathogenic PABPN1 variants. Through analyses spanning micro- to nanoscale, we identified distinct structural features of aggregates formed by wild-type and expanded PABPN1. We demonstrate that these differences were more pronounced in differentiated muscle cells compared to proliferating cells. We further linked the structural features of PABPN1 aggregates to muscle cell biology, namely alterations in mitochondrial function and proteasomal activity. Our findings provide new insights into the structural distinctions between pathogenic and non-pathogenic aggregates and their implications for cellular dysfunction in NMDs.",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,2025,Sander D Mallon; Erik Bos; Vahid Sheikhhassani; Milad Shademan; Lenard M Voortman; Alireza Mashaghi; Thomas H Sharp; Vered Raz
40552923,"[Myxedema psychosis, a rare complication of untreated hypothyroidism].","Myxedema psychosis, also known as myxedema madness, is a rare neuropsychiatric manifestation of untreated or inadequately treated hypothyroidism. We report the case of a 46-year-old woman presenting to the emergency department with acute psychiatric symptoms, including confusion, hallucinations, and delusions. Physical examination revealed classic signs of hypothyroidism, such as periorbital edema, dry skin, and diffuse hair loss. Laboratory results showed a markedly elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 45.76 mU/L and a severely reduced free thyroxine (T4) level (< 1.0 pmol/L), confirming the diagnosis of myxedema psychosis. Intravenous administration of levothyroxine and liothyronine (T3) led to rapid resolution of psychotic symptoms. This case report underscores the critical need to evaluate somatic causes, including hypothyroidism in patients presenting with acute psychiatric symptoms. Timely diagnosis and appropriate thyroid hormone replacement therapy can result in full recovery.",Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,2025,Maaike A Speelman; Gerlinde G L Haverkamp
40552915,Interplay Between γ-Zone Peripapillary Atrophy and Optic Disc Parameters in Central Visual Field Impairment in Highly Myopic Eyes.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between the development of glaucoma-like central visual field (VF) defects and γ-zone peripapillary atrophy (γPPA) in eyes with high myopia (HM). This retrospective study measured γPPA length, prelaminar tissue (PLT) thickness, and lamina cribrosa (LC) defects' width in HM eyes with central VF defects by swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT). The central VF was assessed by using the Humphrey Field Analyzer 10-2 program, and average light sensitivity in the papillomacular bundle region (C1 region) and mean deviation (MD) values were calculated. Interactions among the central VF and structural abnormalities were analyzed using correlation tests and linear regression. Forty-five eyes from 45 patients were included. PLT thickness was positively associated with light sensitivity in the C1 region and MD values, whereas γPPA was associated only with MD values. LC defects showed no association with either the C1 region or MD values. LC defects' width was negatively correlated with γPPA length. Stratified analysis showed that in the group with γPPA length ≥763 µm, PLT thickness was positively associated, and γPPA length was negatively associated with the C1 region and MD values. No such associations were found when the γPPA length was <763 µm. The association between LC defects with central VF remained nonsignificant. Our findings identified γPPA length and PLT thickness as risk factors of glaucoma-like central VF defects in HM, particularly when γPPA length exceeds 763 µm. We suggest that HM eyes with larger γPPA and thinner PLT should be paid special attention for early detection of central VF defects.",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,2025,Nan Zhou; Takeshi Yoshida; Keigo Sugisawa; Sota Yoshimoto; Kyoko Ohno-Matsui
40552911,Twelve-month prevalence and correlates of criminal offending in a nationally representative sample of people with psychotic disorders.,"We used a large, representative sample of adults with psychotic disorders (<i>N</i> = 1825) from the 2010 Australian national survey of psychotic disorders (Survey of High Impact Psychosis - SHIP) to report on 12-month prevalence of both any and violent criminal offending among people with psychotic disorders, and examine correlates of criminal offending, modelling the impact of clinical factors over known sociodemographic and behavioural risk factors. Any past year criminal offending was the main outcome variable, based on self-reported criminal offending, charge and/or arrest. We assessed the additional impact of clinical variables over other risk factors associated with criminal offending. Odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals determined from logistic regression summarised the association of risk factors with offending outcomes. Of 1784 participants with valid responses, 305 (220 men, 85 women) reported criminal offending; 38 men and 6 women reporting some violent offending. Compared with non-offenders, younger age, male sex, homelessness, cannabis and other drug use, and past year delusions and mania were associated with offending in logistic regression models. We found that known sociodemographic risk factors such as sex and homelessness were predictive of both any offending and violent offending. Other significant correlates of any offending behaviour were cannabis use, other illicit substance use and violent victimisation. Clinical factors including past year delusions, mania and deliberate self-harm, and premorbid personality disorder were associated with any offending but not with violent offending. Our study challenges the importance given to many clinical factors, especially in regard to risk of violent offending.",The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,2025,Anoop Sankaranarayanan; Patsy Di Prinzio; Frank Morgan; Giulietta Valuri; David Castle; Anna Waterreus; Vera A Morgan
40552876,Prevalence of Elder Abuse and Neglect of Persons with Dementia in Community Settings: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Individuals with dementia are at an elevated risk for abuse and neglect. This study aimed to estimate pooled prevalence rates of elder abuse among community-dwelling individuals with dementia using a meta-analytic approach. Additionally, it explored the heterogeneity associated with prevalence estimates through subgroup analyses. In line with the Cochrane guidelines, searches were conducted across eight academic online databases, reference lists of eligible studies, and existing systematic reviews. Eligible studies are studies published between January 1990 and March 2023 that report elder abuse among people with dementia (PWD) in community settings. The final review included 30 eligible studies from eight countries, encompassing a sample of 6,789 dependent/carer dyads. The pooled rate of overall abuse among older adults with dementia is 42.6% (95% CI: 0.34-0.51). Among the various forms of abuse, psychological abuse was most prevalent, occurring in 44.8% of cases (95% CI: 0.37, 0.52), followed by financial abuse (28.3%, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.53), neglect (19.8%, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.34), and physical abuse (10%, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.13). The high prevalence of elder abuse highlights the significant vulnerability of individuals with dementia. The highest rate of psychological abuse indicates a particular need to address emotional trauma of PWD, as well as to adopt measures to reduce abusive or neglectful behaviors via caregiver education and support.",Gerontology,2025,Yan Shen; Fei Sun; Yali Feng; Peter A Lichtenberg; Hongdao Meng
40552866,AI and Machine Learning for Detection and Management of Delirium in Care Home Residents.,"Presently, diagnosing delirium in older people is a challenge. Diagnostic support tools such as the Confusion Assessment Method and 4AT provide structure but require specialist training, resources, and implementation support, while some subjectivity persists in diagnosis. This is particularly the case in people who live with dementia who often experience rapid fluctuation in cognitive abilities and behaviours. This leads to variation in diagnosis between settings and care providers, with consequent harmful impact on those experiencing delirium. These challenges become greater in care homes where dementia is prevalent, daily fluctuation is the norm, and the majority of staff are not trained healthcare professionals. Here, we outline the potential for AI-based human activity recognition (HAR) approaches to identify and flag deviations from normal behaviour that may be precursors of a delirium state, enabling earlier detection and management, and better outcomes. We outline how statistical process control approaches could form the basis of diagnostic algorithms and the steps required to test the feasibility of this approach in the care home setting. Delirium detection and diagnosis, difficult in any setting, are more difficult in care homes because of resident, staff, and organisational factors. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and HAR have potential to make diagnosis more reliable because of their ability to recognise changes from normal patterns of behaviour at an individual level.",Gerontology,2025,Jay Banerjee; Fabian Hoger; Adam Lee Gordon
40552865,Sarcopenia Is Poorly Documented in Geriatric Rehabilitation Inpatients: Restoring Health of Acutely Unwell Adults (RESORT).,"Sarcopenia is highly prevalent in older inpatients. However, it is unclear if sarcopenia is documented routinely in geriatric rehabilitation. This study aimed to investigate the documentation of sarcopenia in medical records among geriatric rehabilitation patients. Geriatric rehabilitation inpatients in a statewide hospital in VIC, Australia, were included. Patient characteristics, muscle measurements, and medical records at admission and discharge were collected. Sarcopenia was defined using the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2 (EWGSOP2). Patient characteristics were compared between the groups with documented and non-documented sarcopenia using the Wilcoxon rank-sum or chi-square test. Of 1,890 geriatric rehabilitation inpatients (aged 83.4 [interquartile range: 77.6-88.4] years, 56.3% female), muscle measurements were available in 1,334 patients at admission. The prevalence of sarcopenia was 20.8% (n = 278). Sarcopenia was documented in 68 out of 1,890 patients; 23 of them did not have muscle mass or muscle strength measured. Forty-five patients with muscle measurements available were documented with sarcopenia either at discharge from acute admissions (n = 9), on rehabilitation admission (n = 25), or at discharge from rehabilitation (n = 26). Of these 45 patients, 8 patients had sarcopenia following the EWGSOP2 criteria. Compared with patients without sarcopenia documented, patients documented with sarcopenia had lower body mass index and sarcopenia screening (Strength, Assistance in Walking, Rise from a Chair, Climb Stairs, Falls History [SARC-F]) scores and higher Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) scores and were likely to come from nursing homes. Documentation of sarcopenia was lower than the prevalence of sarcopenia in geriatric rehabilitation inpatients. Sarcopenia was incorrectly documented as data on muscle measurement were missing to define sarcopenia. Practitioners likely used clinical impressions to document sarcopenia, rather than the formal diagnostic criteria.",Gerontology,2025,Thang Dao; Cheng Hwee Soh; Esmee M Reijnierse; Lihuan Guan; Andrea B Maier
40552864,The Association between Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha Inhibitor Use and Dementia Risk in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (TNFi), commonly prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), have been studied for their potential association with dementia risk. However, previous findings are inconclusive. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of TNFi use on dementia in patients with RA. A systematical search of MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL databases from inception to October 1, 2023, was conducted. Longitudinal comparative studies investigating the association between TNFi use and risk of dementia in patients with RA were included. Pooled adjusted risks of dementia and meta-analysis were conducted to synthesize relative estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Seven observational studies involving 633,089 patients with RA were included, of which 6 were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled meta-analysis comparing the risk of dementia (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.64-0.93) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (odds ratio = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.23-0.43) between TNFi users and non-users showed a significant association. However, the pooled HR for AD risk was inconsistent. Also, the subgroup analyses indicated that TNFi use was associated with a decreased dementia risk in older adult patients with a mean age of ≥65 years at enrollment (HR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.80-0.92) and TNFi new users (HR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.80-0.92). Systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that lowering the level of systemic TNF-alpha by using TNFi could lower the risk of dementia. However, given the retrospective nature of the included studies, further prospective studies are needed to evaluate the role of TNFi in dementia onset.",Gerontology,2025,DaRae Chung; Yoojin Noh; Yun Mi Yu; Young-Mi Ah
40552851,Identification of a Risk Allele at SLC41A3 and a Protective Allele HLA-DPB1*02:01 Associated with Sarcopenia in Japanese.,"Age-related alterations in muscle tissue morphology and function, as well as chronic pro-inflammatory conditions, contribute to the development of sarcopenia. To elucidate the multidimensional pathogenesis of sarcopenia, we performed a comprehensive genetic analysis, including common variants, rare variants, and human leukemia antigen (HLA). A total of 129 older adults were analyzed using whole-genome sequencing (WGS), including 67 sarcopenia patients and 62 normal controls. Sarcopenia was diagnosed according to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 consensus. WGS data and associated clinical data were obtained from the National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology Biobank in Japan. We performed logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index for common variant (minor allele frequency [MAF] ≧0.01), rare variant (MAF <0.01), and HLA analyses. For the functional analysis, we performed RNA interference using human myoblasts and estimated gene expressions (MYOG, MYMK, MYMG) by quantitative PCR. Rare variant analysis identified five rare coding variants of genes - SLC41A3, SYNRG, CLUAP1, CCHCR1, and ALDH2 - expressed in skeletal muscle. Of these, a deleterious frameshift deletion in SLC41A3 was associated with the pathogenesis of sarcopenia (p = 0.0012, odds ratio [OR] = 11.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.62-50.69). This deletion significantly reduced expression of myogenin (MYOG), a factor involved in myoblast differentiation (p = 0.0094), but did not affect the fusion of myogenic cells. We also discovered a new protective allele, HLA-DPB1*02:01 associated with sarcopenia (OR = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.060-0.51, p = 0.0015), which has a high occurrence rate in the Northeast Asian population. Rare variant analysis identified a deleterious frameshift deletion in SLC41A3 as a risk factor for sarcopenia. Our findings suggest that the suppression of MYOG could play a role in myogenesis or muscle maintenance, although this mutation did not impact the terminal differentiation of human myoblasts. Additionally, HLA analysis revealed that HLA-DPB1*02:01 has a protective effect, especially in Northeast Asian populations. Our study enhances the understanding of the etiology of sarcopenia and provides new insights into the mechanisms of its pathogenesis.",Gerontology,2025,Motoki Furutani; Tetsuaki Kimura; Koya Fukunaga; Mutsumi Suganuma; Marie Takemura; Yasumoto Matsui; Shosuke Satake; Yukiko Nakano; Taisei Mushiroda; Shumpei Niida; Kouichi Ozaki; Tohru Hosoyama; Daichi Shigemizu
40552835,Loss of Glutaminase 1 in Small Sensory Neurons Prevents Nerve Injury Induced Mechanical Allodynia: Insights From Conditional Knockout Mice.,"Glutamate, the primary neurotransmitter released by nociceptors, is predominantly synthesised by the enzyme Glutaminase 1 (GLS1). The involvement of GLS1 in pain pathways is well supported, as Gls1 heterozygous mice exhibit altered nociception and GLS1 levels increase in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) under chronic peripheral inflammation. However, the specific contribution of GLS1 in sensory neurons to the development and maintenance of chronic neuropathic pain remains unclear. To explore this, we specifically targeted GLS1 expression in nociceptors. We used the Cre-LoxP system to generate a transgenic mouse with a specific deletion of Gls1 gene in neurons expressing the Nav1.8 sodium channel. Gene deletion was assessed by genomic PCR and immunofluorescence. GLS1 conditional knockout (cKO) mice and control littermates, under naïve conditions or following spared nerve injury (SNI), were analysed for mechanical allodynia and for expression of GLS1 and other components of the glutamatergic system using real-time PCR and Western blotting. GLS1 cKO mice exhibited a significant reduction in GLS1 levels in the DRG, particularly in medium- to small-sized neurons. GLS1 deficiency prevented the development of mechanical allodynia following peripheral nerve injury. SNI induced GLS1 upregulation in the DRG of control mice, but not in cKO mice. In the spinal cord, NMDA receptor expression decreased after SNI only in naïve animals, while GLS1 and other glutamate receptors remained unchanged under all conditions. Upregulation of GLS1 in sensory neurons after peripheral nerve injury contributes to mechanical allodynia. Targeting peripheral GLS1 could offer a potential analgesic strategy for neuropathic pain. We generated a transgenic mouse with a specific deletion of the Gls1 gene in Nav1.8-expressing neurons to assess the role of peripheral GLS1 in pain transmission. GLS1 is not required for physiological pain but is essential for the development of mechanical allodynia after nerve injury. GLS1 is upregulated in nociceptors following nerve injury, suggesting enhanced glutamate signalling. Taken together, results suggest that targeting GLS1 expression in neuropathic conditions could be a potential therapeutic strategy.","European journal of pain (London, England)",2025,Anabel Martínez-Padilla; Javier Márquez; Miguel Á Huerta; Carolina Roza; Elsa Cisneros
40552782,Prevalence and prognosis of sarcopenia in acute COVID-19 and long COVID: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"A comprehensive investigation delineating the prevalence of sarcopenia across different infection phases, from acute COVID-19 to long COVID, is lacking. Meanwhile, the relationship between sarcopenia and adverse outcomes among COVID-19 patients remains inconsistent. A systematic search of MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus, before 22nd February 2025, was conducted to identify studies assessing sarcopenia prevalence in acute COVID-19 and long COVID. Random effects meta-analyses were performed to estimate the pooled prevalence of sarcopenia for acute COVID-19 and long COVID patients. Subgroup analyses stratified by assessment tool, region, income, hospitalization status, and age were performed. The associations between sarcopenia and COVID-19-related clinical outcomes were further quantified. A total of 39 studies with 6,982 individuals were included. The pooled prevalence of sarcopenia was 48.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 39.6-57.9%) in acute COVID-19 and 23.5% (95% CI: 12.7-39.4%) in long COVID. In acute COVID-19 patients, sarcopenia was not significantly associated with length of stay (mean difference = 2.215, 95% CI: -0.004 to 4.433), mechanical ventilation (Odds ratio (OR) = 1.80, 95% CI: 0.84-3.85), admission to the intensive care unit (OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.63-1.77), or mortality (OR = 1.41, 95% CI: 0.86-2.32), but was significantly associated with tracheostomy (OR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.28-4.82). In conclusion, our findings indicate that sarcopenia is highly prevalent in acute COVID-19 and persists in a substantial proportion of long COVID patients, suggesting prolonged muscle loss beyond the acute phase. Future well-designed studies are needed to further investigate the association between sarcopenia and short-term and long-term prognostic outcomes in both acute and long COVID patients.",Annals of medicine,2025,Ying Xu; Jia-Wen Xu; You Wu; Li-Juan Rong; Li Ye; Oscar H Franco; Ching-Wen Chien; Xiao-Ru Feng; Jia-Yu Chen; Tao-Hsin Tung
40552744,Simultaneously Dealing With Immortal Time Bias and Residual Confounding: A Case Study of a High-Dimensional Propensity Score Approach With a Nested Case-Control Framework in Multiple Sclerosis Research.,"Observational studies of time-dependent treatments often face immortal time bias and residual confounding, complicating treatment effect estimation. We implemented a high-dimensional propensity score (hdPS) analysis within a nested case-control (NCC) framework to address both biases simultaneously. We used a retrospective cohort of 19 360 individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) in British Columbia, Canada, to examine the relationship between disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) and all-cause mortality. A 1:4 NCC analysis addressed immortal time bias, and hdPS was applied to handle residual confounding. Sensitivity analyses tested the robustness of findings across various hdPS parameters and matching strategies. We matched a total of 3209 cases to 12 293 controls in the NCC analysis, and demonstrated a 28% reduction in mortality risk associated with exposure to DMDs (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62-0.84) in the NCC-hdPS analysis. Sensitivity analyses using different propensity score estimation techniques and control-matching strategies yielded consistent results, with HRs ranging between 0.70 and 0.77. This study offers a practical framework for addressing immortal time bias and residual confounding simultaneously, improving the validity of effect estimates in real-world studies. We shared reproducible R codes for researchers to facilitate the adoption of this methodology in their research.",Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,2025,Md Belal Hossain; Huah Shin Ng; Feng Zhu; Helen Tremlett; Mohammad Ehsanul Karim
40552725,Cerebral Venous Thrombosis During Pregnancy and Postpartum: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a rare but life-threatening condition, particularly among pregnant and postpartum women. However, estimates of its incidence, recurrence, and associated adverse outcomes remain inconsistent. Moreover, the role of antithrombotic prophylaxis in mitigating these risks has not been fully established. This study aimed to synthesize global evidence on the incidence of CVT during pregnancy and postpartum, evaluate recurrence rates of CVT and noncerebral venous thromboembolism (VTE), assess adverse pregnancy outcomes, and explore the efficacy and safety of antithrombotic prophylaxis in high-risk populations. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Five major databases were searched for observational studies reporting CVT incidence, recurrence, or pregnancy outcomes in women with prior CVT or noncerebral VTE, covering the period from 1980 to September 2024, with an updated search completed on May 6, 2025. Data were pooled using random-effects models and heterogeneity was quantified via the I² statistic. Forty-seven studies encompassing 14,218 pregnancies were included. The pooled incidence of postpartum CVT was 7 cases per 100,000 deliveries (95% CI: 3-15), with significant regional disparities (Asia: 19/100,000; Europe: 3/100,000). The recurrence rate of CVT was 10.2 per 1,000 deliveries (95% CI: 5-21), while noncerebral VTE recurred in 15.3 per 1,000 pregnancies (95% CI: 8-28). The crude risk of spontaneous abortion was 15.7% (95% CI: 31.4-39.4), with higher rates observed in women not receiving prophylaxis. Antithrombotic prophylaxis appeared to reduce the risk of noncerebral VTE recurrence but did not significantly affect CVT recurrence. CVT and noncerebral VTE pose substantial risks during pregnancy, particularly in women with prior thrombotic events. Although antithrombotic prophylaxis may offer partial protection, its benefits must be carefully weighed against potential maternal and fetal risks. These findings underscore the need for individualized management and further research to inform evidence-based clinical guidelines.",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,2025,Xiaoming Zhang; Kun Fang; Yiran Zhang; Jiahao Song; Ruolin Wang; Xunming Ji; Ran Meng; Da Zhou
40552707,Personalized Treatment Selection for Multivariate Ordinal Scale Outcomes and Multiple Treatments.,"In this study, we present an innovative approach for tailoring treatment selection on an individualized basis in the presence of correlated multiple responses, particularly those measured on ordinal scales, including binary responses. Our methodology involves the utilization of rank lists for treatments, generated from probabilities of observing responses of higher order than each level of the ordinal outcome, conditional on patient covariate measurements. We introduce a rank aggregation technique designed to amalgamate multiple lists of ranks, allowing for correlations both within these lists and among elements within each list. Our approach is versatile, accommodating any number of treatments and responses, and is applicable across a wide range of models. Our method offers flexibility by allowing the integration of response weights, enabling customization based on patient and clinician preferences on an individual case basis for optimal treatment decisions. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method in finite samples, we conducted a simulation study. Furthermore, we provide two illustrative examples using data from clinical trials on Cystic Fibrosis and Alzheimer's Disease, demonstrating the application of our proposed procedure in real-world scenarios.",Pharmaceutical statistics,2025,Chathura Siriwardhana; Bakeerathan Gunaratnam; K B Kulasekera
40552686,Comparing Folic Acid Interventions and Arsenic Reduction Strategies for Neural Tube Defect Prevention in Bangladesh: A Systematic Review and Decision Analysis.,"Maternal intake of folic acid prevents most cases of neural tube defects (NTDs), and arsenic exposure may increase NTD risk. In Bangladesh, where arsenic exposures are high, understanding the potential impacts of arsenic reduction and folic acid-based interventions can guide decision-making. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of NTDs in Bangladesh. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Global Health, and Bangladesh Journals Online and extracted data using standardized forms. We used forest plots and random effects models to estimate the prevalence of all NTDs and spina bifida. Decision analysis used assumptions from the literature to compare expected NTD prevalence under strategies incorporating combinations of folic acid supplementation, fortification, and arsenic filters. Sensitivity analyses aimed to quantify the influence of adherence to supplements on estimates. Eleven studies were included. Prevalences of NTD and spina bifida were 27.4 and 11.2 per 10,000 births, respectively; however, when estimated from population red blood cell folate concentrations, NTD prevalence was higher in both high arsenic exposure (drinking water ≥ 50 μg/L) and lower arsenic exposure groups (34.3 and 25.3 per 10,000 births, respectively). Folic acid fortification reduced the prevalence of NTDs to 11.1 and 9.1 per 10,000 births among high exposure and low exposure groups, respectively. Arsenic filters provided little marginal benefit. Benefits of supplements equaled those of fortification when adherence to supplements exceeded 90%. Bangladesh has high rates of NTDs and high arsenic exposures. Folic acid fortification is projected to be the most effective strategy for NTD prevention.",Birth defects research,2025,Chih-Fu Wei; Ernani F Choma; Xingyan Wang; Carrie G Wade; Ya Luan Hsiao; Diane Bao; Sudipta K Mukherjee; David C Christiani; Marc G Weisskopf; Liming Liang; Maitreyi Mazumdar
40552685,Hearing Loss Profiles in Sporadic and Familial Microtia: Clinical Insights From an Ecuadorian Cohort.,"Microtia is a congenital anomaly of the external ear that often leads to hearing loss due to associated auditory canal and middle ear malformations. While right-ear predominance and conductive hearing loss are well-documented, few studies have compared anatomical and audiological differences between sporadic and familial cases, especially in underrepresented populations. To compare the clinical, anatomical, and auditory characteristics of patients with sporadic versus familial microtia in an Ecuadorian cohort. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 146 patients with microtia, classified as either sporadic or familial. Demographic, clinical, and risk factor data were collected through structured interviews. Audiological evaluations included auditory evoked potentials, otoacoustic emissions, tympanometry, pure-tone audiometry, and speech audiometry, based on patient age and canal patency. Statistical analysis included Mann-Whitney U and Chi-square tests (p < 0.05). Right-ear involvement was most common (45.45%). Grade 3 microtia was the most prevalent, while Grade 4 was observed exclusively in familial cases. Conductive hearing loss predominated (74.67% left ear, 83.33% right ear). Although no significant differences in hearing loss type or severity were found between groups, familial cases showed a trend toward more severe impairment. Otoacoustic emissions and stapedial reflexes were more frequently absent in right ears. Pure tone perception and speech recognition were also more impaired on the right side. Microtia is most commonly right-sided and associated with significant conductive hearing loss. Familial cases may present with more severe features. Early diagnosis and intervention are essential to mitigate developmental consequences, particularly in resource-limited settings.",Birth defects research,2025,Fabricio González-Andrade; Fausto Coello; Edwin Andrade; Henry Vásconez
40552657,Non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related cryptococcal meningitis with recurrent acute stroke: A case report.,"Cryptococcal meningitis has been reported to be primarily associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Herein, we report the case of a male patient in China with recurrent acute stroke as the first clinical manifestation, followed by several symptoms of intracranial infection, such as headache, a stiff neck, disturbance of consciousness, and high fever. The patient tested negative for human immunodeficiency virus and was diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis after lung computed tomography, cranial computed tomography, cranial magnetic resonance imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid examination. The combination of conventional amphotericin B and flucytosine tablets progressively worsened the patient's condition. This was accompanied by a series of complications, such as respiratory failure, hepatic and renal insufficiency, and infectious shock, leading to the patient's death. To date, only a few cases of non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related cryptococcal meningitis with recurrent acute stroke have been reported. This case report suggests that clinicians should be alert to the possibility of cryptococcal meningitis in patients with imaging manifestations of meningitis and promptly perform cryptococcal capsular antigen testing, a highly sensitive screening method. Therefore, this case study could lead to new insights into the clinical diagnosis and treatment of non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related cryptococcal meningitis with recurrent acute stroke.",The Journal of international medical research,2025,Bijun Ye; Jian Wu; Yinhong Qiu; Weiqiang Fan; Jiating Xu; Yiping Tang

40552614,Social Skill Profiles in ADHD and Comorbid Disorders.,"Many children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) demonstrate impairment in social skills. However, ADHD rarely occurs in isolation, with approximately one-third of children with ADHD having one additional disorder, and another third having two or three comorbidities. Few studies have considered the global and specific patterns of social skill performance based on comorbidity status. Using a large dataset containing 1400 carefully phenotyped children with ADHD (ages 7-12; 28% girls) in the United States and Canada, we characterized social skill deficit profiles associated with the presence of internalizing comorbidity (depression and/or anxiety), externalizing comorbidity (oppositional defiant or conduct disorder), and both internalizing + externalizing comorbidities. All children had parent and teacher ratings of social skills on a consistent measure, and we took a nuanced approach that considered both global social skills and specific subdomains of skills. Parent ratings indicated main and interaction effects of each comorbidity on lower social skill performance in a varied pattern. Both comorbidities were associated with poorer global social skills, responsibility, and self-control. In addition, internalizing was associated with poorer assertion, while externalizing was associated with poorer communication, cooperation, and empathy. Interaction effects suggested that the impact of externalizing overshadowed internalizing for poor responsibility and self-control; however, internalizing comorbidity attenuated the negative association between externalizing comorbidity and empathy. On teacher ratings, only externalizing comorbidity was associated with poorer global social skills, communication, cooperation, assertion, responsibility, empathy, and self-control. In addition, girls and younger children tended to have poorer global social skills (using a gender-normed standard score), while girls and older children showed better specific social skills (using a raw, not gender-normed score). Children with ADHD and these comorbidities had poorer social skills relative to children with ADHD only, as perceived by parents and teachers. There also may be different social skill profiles depending on the comorbid condition and informant. These findings may inform more personalized social skill interventions for children with ADHD.",Journal of attention disorders,2025,Caroline E Miller; L Eugene Arnold; Andrea Chronis-Tuscano; Lily Hechtman; Stephen P Hinshaw; Michael J Kofler; Brooke S G Molina; Sébastien Normand; Linda J Pfiffner; Amori Yee Mikami
40552560,Clinical and Genetic Findings in a Chinese Cohort of Dentatorubral-Pallidoluysian Atrophy Patients.,"Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of cytosine-adenine-guanine repeats in ATN1. Most studies on DRPLA to date are limited to case reports. We aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the clinical, genetic, biological, and magnetic resonance imaging characteristics of DRPLA using cross-sectional baseline data. This is a cross-sectional observational cohort study. We used an extensive battery of assessments, included clinical phenotypes, genotypes, cognitive performance, biological markers, and magnetic resonance imaging characteristics. We enrolled 116 DRPLA patients, including 96 manifest patients and 20 prodromal patients. We identified a previously unreported ATN1 haplotype consisting of 8 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Cognitive assessments revealed that 51 manifest patients (96%) and 4 prodromal patients (29%) scored <26 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Manifest patients showed impairments across all cognitive domains, whereas prodromal patients showed deficits only in phonemic fluency. Biological analyses showed significantly elevated plasma neurofilament light levels in manifest patients compared with prodromal patients (P < 0.001) and healthy controls (P < 0.001). Magnetic resonance imaging findings revealed widespread gray matter loss across the whole brain in manifest patients, whereas prodromal patients showed gray matter loss localized to the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres. This is the first DRPLA cohort study to comprehensively report clinical, genetic, cognitive, imaging, and plasma neurofilament light data. This study provides robust data to enhance our understanding of the overall features of DRPLA. We also propose clear definitions for the preclinical stage of DRPLA, and demonstrate the high diagnostic utility of plasma neurofilament light as a biomarker.

40552544,Reversal of Diabesity Through Modulating Sympathetic Inputs to Adipose Tissue Following Carotid Body Resection.,"The development of innovative strategies to treat diabesity and its comorbidities is of major societal importance. The carotid bodies (CB), classically defined as O<sub>2</sub> sensors, are also metabolic sensors whose dysfunction contributes to the genesis and progression of metabolic disturbances. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the CBs are key players in the neural hypothalamic-sympathetic circuit controlling glucose and energy homeostasis. Moreover, we investigated if abolishment of CB activity has an anti-diabesity effect in Wistar rats and C75BL/6J mice, associated with increased visceral white and brown adipose tissue (AT) metabolism and the restoration of sympathetic activity within these tissues. We demonstrate that resection of the carotid sinus nerve, the CB-sensitive nerve, promotes weight loss and restores metabolic function in obese rats and mice by enhancing tyrosine hydroxylase expression at the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and its efferent sympathetic neurons to the AT. Moreover, we found that CSN resection increases sympathetic integration and catecholaminergic action in the AT in a manner that restores or even increases AT metabolism. We provide groundbreaking and innovative data showing a new circuit involving the CB-hypothalamus-sympathetic efferents and the AT in controlling glucose and energy homeostasis and so a novel pathway for managing diabesity.","Acta physiologica (Oxford, England)",2025,Bernardete F Melo; Joana F Sacramento; Julien Lavergne; Fátima O Martins; Daniela Rosendo-Silva; Clara Panzolini; Cláudia S Prego; Aidan Falvey; Elena Olea; Paulo Matafome; Asuncion Rocher; Jesus Prieto-Lloret; Miguel C Correia; Phillipe Blancou; Silvia V Conde

40552535,Ciliary biology intersects autism and congenital heart disease.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and congenital heart disease (CHD) frequently co-occur, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms of this comorbidity remain unknown. Given that children with CHD are identified as newborns, understanding which CHD variants are associated with autism could help select individuals for early intervention. Autism gene perturbations commonly dysregulate neural progenitor cell (NPC) biology, so we hypothesized that CHD genes disrupting neurogenesis are more likely to increase ASD risk. Therefore, we performed an in vitro pooled CRISPR interference screen to identify CHD genes disrupting NPC biology and identified 45 CHD genes. A cluster of ASD and CHD genes are enriched for ciliary biology, and perturbing any one of seven such genes (CEP290, CHD4, KMT2E, NSD1, OFD1, RFX3 and TAOK1) impairs primary cilia formation in vitro. In vivo investigation of TAOK1 in Xenopus tropicalis reveals a role in motile cilia formation and heart development, supporting its prediction as a CHD gene. Together, our findings highlight a set of CHD genes that may carry risk for ASD and underscore the role of cilia in shared ASD and CHD biology.","Development (Cambridge, England)",2025,Nia Teerikorpi; Kate E McCluskey; Ethel Bader; Micaela C Lasser; Sheng Wang; Catherine H Nguyen; James D Schmidt; Elina Kostyanovskaya; Nawei Sun; Jeanselle Dea; Tomasz J Nowakowski; A Jeremy Willsey; Helen Rankin Willsey
40552492,"Nicotine dependence, quit intentions, and cessation efforts among daily tobacco-using healthcare students, professionals, and staff in Eastern India: insights from a multicentric study.","Tobacco use among healthcare workers compromises their role as cessation advocates. This study focuses on nicotine dependence, quit intentions, and cessation efforts among daily tobacco-using healthcare students, professionals, and staff in Eastern India. A multicentric cross-sectional study using a structured questionnaire was conducted in 24 healthcare institutions across Bihar and Jharkhand during July-August 2023, analysing data from 729 daily tobacco users among a total of 7619 participants. The mean nicotine dependence score was 4.6 ± 2.3, with 49.2% showing moderate dependence, 38.4% low, and 12.3% high. Among daily users, 63.1% expressed quit intentions. Two-thirds (67.9%) attempted to quit in the past year, with 36.6% using nicotine replacement therapy and 62.0% trying unaided. Participants without quit intentions had higher odds of moderate dependence [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 9.36] and high dependence (AOR = 28.8). Receiving no cessation advice increased the odds of moderate (AOR = 5.30) and high dependence (AOR = 16.15). Quit intentions were associated with lower nicotine dependence (AOR = 29.9 for low and 4.04 for moderate), receiving quit advice (AOR = 2.03), and awareness of tobacco control laws (AOR = 1.08 per unit). Quit attempts were influenced by quit intentions (AOR = 13.03), lower nicotine dependence (AOR = 2.68 for moderate), and receiving cessation advice (AOR = 2.82).

40552480,Coaxial Bioprinting of Schwann Cells and Neural Stem Cells in a Three-Dimensional Microenvironment for the Repair of Peripheral Nerve Defects.,"Currently, autologous nerve (AN) transplantation remains the gold standard for treating peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs). However, its inherent limitations, including donor site morbidity and immune rejection risks associated with allografts, have prompted the exploration of alternative therapeutic strategies. Among these, tissue engineering approaches have gained significant attention, with nerve conduit design emerging as a particularly promising research direction. Electrospinning technology has been widely adopted for its ability to fabricate nanofibrous scaffolds that closely mimic the native extracellular matrix. In this study, we engineered an aligned nanofiber conduit utilizing polylactic acid and gelatin through electrospinning, and integrated a sodium alginate hydrogel enriched with Schwann cells (SCs) and neural stem cells (NSCs) via coaxial bioprinting. The three-dimensional (3D) hydrogel microenvironment facilitated synergistic interactions between SCs and NSCs, augmenting the secretion of neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF). A dynamic perfusion culture system was further employed to optimize cell viability and functionality. In vivo studies revealed that the implantation of this conduit in a sciatic nerve defect model markedly enhanced motor function recovery, nerve regeneration, and muscle morphology. These improvements were substantiated by an increased sciatic functional index (SFI), heightened expression of S-100 and NF-200, and greater myelin thickness and axon diameter. Although the efficacy of the 3D-aligned nanofiber conduit cocultured with SCs and NSCs approximated that of AN transplantation, further research is imperative to identify more efficient seed cells and biocompatible 3D carriers to achieve optimal nerve regeneration. This study highlights the potential of tissue-engineered nerve conduits as a viable alternative for PNI repair, paving the way for future advancements in the field.",Journal of biomedical materials research.

40552465,How do different cell populations orchestrate myelin regeneration?,"Approximately 35 in 100,000 people are affected by diseases associated with loss of myelin, generally described as demyelinating diseases. Demyelinating diseases encompass many different pathological conditions characterized by heterogeneous and sometimes disease-specific etiopathological mechanisms. While several approaches aimed at ameliorating the symptoms and the progression of some of these diseases exist, the most effective cure for all demyelinating diseases would be regeneration of lost myelin. Myelin regeneration occurs spontaneously in the central nervous system in response to myelin damage but is inefficient for a variety of reasons, especially in human patients. In this review, we will discuss the contributions of different cell populations to the creation of conditions permissive for effective remyelination and to the formation of new myelin after injury. Moreover, we would like to highlight the importance of sphingolipids in the network of interactions between these cell populations. Mutations in genes encoding sphingolipid metabolic enzymes (such as GALC) represent a major risk factor for multiple sclerosis, and alterations in sphingolipid metabolism in specific cell types contribute to myelin damage. On the other hand, sphingolipid signaling, in particular through sphingosine 1 phosphate, directly affects the process of myelin regeneration, with distinct effects on different cellular populations.",Biochemical Society transactions,2025,Sara Grassi; Alessandro Prinetti

Diagnostic assessments are essential for effective treatment. However, research suggests that Child and Adolescent Psychiatry practices remain inadequate. Knowledge of healthcare processes is limited, with no consensus on conceptualising or measuring quality. This study aimed to investigate depression assessments in Swedish outpatient Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, including associations with predictors and diagnostic timeliness. <b>Methods:</b> Medical records (<i>n</i> = 284) from patients aged 8-17 with depression were collected from 10 services. Quality indicators for depressive symptoms, suicidality, comorbidities, and functioning were developed from guidelines. Indicator occurrences were assessed, summarised into components, and analysed using regression and correlations. <b>Results:</b> Indicator occurrences ranged from 8% to 84%, averaging 49%. Documentation varied considerably for risk aspects (57%). Distinct depressive characteristics (63%) occurred nearly twice as often as subtler symptoms (35%). Comorbidities (13%-22%) were rarely documented, whereas functioning and life situation (69%) were well-recorded. Predictors explained up to 28% of variance, with unidentified service-related factors explaining 10%. Better documentation weakly correlated with earlier diagnoses. <b>Conclusions:</b> Findings indicate the need for guideline implementation and further investigation into assessment inequities. Improving quality might promote earlier diagnoses.

40552445,Cultural perceptions and social determinants of health in perinatal mental health: An obstetric-psychiatric perspective.,"Perinatal mental health is significantly influenced by social and cultural determinants, including socioeconomic status, education, cultural beliefs, and healthcare access. These factors shape the prevalence, presentation, and outcomes of mental health disorders during pregnancy and postpartum, as well as influencing help-seeking behaviors and treatment efficacy. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated disparities, particularly among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, emphasizing the need for culturally sensitive amd socially informed care. This narrative review aims to compile current evidence on the intersection of cultural perceptions, social determinants, and perinatal mental health outcomes. Additionally, it proposes culturally acceptable interventions to address disparities in perinatal mental healthcare. The review integrates the existing literature, focusing on the bidirectional relationship between maternal mental health and obstetric outcomes. It highlights the disproportionate concentration of research in high-income, western countries and emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary approaches, such as the integration of psychiatric and obstetric perspectives, to address gaps in low- and middle-income settings. Key findings include the impact of economic instability, low maternal health literacy, limited healthcare access, and inadequate social support on perinatal mental health. Cultural factors, such as stigma, gender roles, and religious beliefs, further influence help-seeking behaviors and treatment outcomes. The review underlines the lack of culturally attuned randomized controlled interventions aimed at perinatal mental health disorders and the need for culturally adapted measurement tools and methodologies. Recommendations include expanding mental health literacy campaigns, improving healthcare accessibility, and addressing systemic discrimination. Future research should focus on evaluating interventions for perinatal mental disorders, incorporating diverse populations, and addressing multimorbidity through holistic, interdisciplinary approaches.",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,2025,Vidhi Vora; Shweta Kanyal; Annanya Chauhan; Pratik Agarwal; Yashendra Sethi
40552393,Understanding barriers in supporting service users with complex post-traumatic stress disorder: a pilot survey.,"<b>Background:</b> Experiences of complex trauma and complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) may be associated with barriers to effective intervention for service users and providers.<b>Objective:</b> This investigation sought to identify barriers to intervention and support for individuals with CPTSD and their service providers.<b>Method:</b> A pilot survey on barriers to services for CPTSD was distributed to members of the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies (ISTSS) Complex Trauma Special Interest Group (CTSIG). A total of 28 respondents provided quantitative ratings of potential barriers to CPTSD intervention and support, and qualitative opinion based on respondents' clinical and research experience. Quantitative data underwent descriptive analyses, and qualitative data were analysed using an inductive content analysis approach.<b>Results:</b> The majority of potential CPTSD-related barriers in this survey were perceived as 'usually' or 'almost always' barriers for service users and providers. The results highlighted CPTSD-related stigma/misunderstanding, inability to drive systemic change, and accessibility of resources as the most significant barriers to effective CPTSD intervention faced by service providers. The main perceived barriers facing individuals with CPTSD were access to supports and services, dissatisfaction with previous intervention(s), and availability of personal and resources. Qualitative remarks indicated relevant barriers in identification and recognition of CPTSD, availability of training, treatment challenge, misdiagnosis, vulnerability due to CPTSD experiences, structural barriers, and symptom-related difficulties.<b>Conclusion:</b> These findings extend our understanding of expert opinion related to CPTSD intervention barriers, and offer indicative directions for future research. Extension of these results is needed to integrate the opinions of more diverse expert groups.",European journal of psychotraumatology,2025,Martin Robinson; Christine A Courtois
40552372,Temporal associations between cultural identity conflict and psychological symptoms among Syrian young adults with refugee backgrounds: a four-wave longitudinal study.,"<b>Objectives:</b> The current study examined temporal associations between cultural identity conflict and psychological symptoms (posttraumatic stress [PTS] and anxiety/depression) in Syrian young adults, who recently migrated to the Netherlands. It was hypothesized that cultural identity conflict predicts intraindividual changes in PTS and anxiety/depression symptoms, in a course of one year, adjusting for trait-like stable invariant levels of both constructs.<b>Methods:</b> Data were obtained from Karakter, a four-wave longitudinal study, with a sample of 158 Syrian young adults with refugee backgrounds (<i>n </i>= 96 at wave 4); 69% men and age range 18-35. Levels of cultural identity conflict, PTS, and anxiety/depression were assessed four times, over 13 months.<b>Results:</b> Random intercept cross-lagged panel model analyses showed relative stability in levels of cultural identity conflict, PTS, and anxiety/depression from one wave to the next. No significant concurrent associations were found between deviations from people's usual levels of cultural identity conflict and PTS symptoms. Additionally, the results revealed two significant negative cross-lagged associations between cultural identity conflict and PTS. No cross-lagged associations were found between cultural identity conflict and anxiety/depression, except one negative directional effect from anxiety/depression at wave 2 to cultural identity conflict at wave 3.<b>Conclusions:</b> Findings indicate that after accounting for between-person differences, cultural identity conflict and psychological symptoms refer to stable, within-person processes over time. We speculate that early intervention focused on PTS, anxiety/depression as well as experienced cultural identity conflict may prevent these problems from becoming chronic, among Syrians with refugee backgrounds in the post-migration context.",European journal of psychotraumatology,2025,Haza F Rahim; Trudy T M Mooren; Jeroen W Knipscheer; Joanne M Chung; Odilia M Laceulle; Paul A Boelen
40552369,From suspicion of cognitive decline to dementia diagnosis: a systematic review of healthcare professionals' considerations and attitudes.,"Initiating diagnostic testing for dementia is a dynamic and complex process that often involves balancing competing interests. This systematic review aims to provide an overview of healthcare professionals' considerations and attitudes during the process from suspicion of cognitive decline to deciding to initiate diagnostic testing. Databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsychINFO) were systematically searched on 29 January 2024 for qualitative and mixed-methods studies published since 2005. Search concepts were: 'dementia', 'considerations and attitudes', 'healthcare professionals' and 'diagnosis'. Two screeners independently conducted title/abstract-screening using ASReview (efficient and transparent systematic review machine learning framework), and full-text screening. Findings were analysed by thematic synthesis. Thirty-three studies were included. Most involved primary care physicians (n = 25), primary care nurses (n = 1) or a combination (n = 7). The overarching phenomenon was that starting the diagnostic workup for dementia is a delicate process. Clusters influencing this process were: complexities arising from the nature of dementia; interaction with the patient and family; individual determinants of primary care practitioners (PCPs); expectations regarding the consequences of a diagnosis; factors related to the healthcare system; and societal factors. Together these clusters form PCPs' strategies and actions for deciding whether to start the diagnostic workup. Initiating the diagnostic workup for dementia is a delicate process influenced by various factors including fear, reluctance and stigma. The different strategies that PCPs use cannot be captured by a single right approach. Recommendations to better support PCPs in navigating this complex process include ensuring consistent communication and clarity about their roles, and promoting interprofessional collaboration.",Age and ageing,2025,Fleur C W Visser; Marleen Kloppenburg-Lagendijk; Liesbeth Hempenius; Nicolaas A Verwey; Marieke Perry; Marlise E A van Eersel; Barbara C van Munster
40552368,End-of-life dementia care: a qualitative study of the experiences and perceptions of minority ethnic and economically disadvantaged groups.,"Dementia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality amongst ageing populations. However, palliative care is often poor or non-existent. People from minority ethnic and economically disadvantaged communities are especially likely to miss out. Research exploring how inclusive end-of-life (EOL) care should be provided for people living with dementia (PLWD) is limited and commonly fails to include sufficient representation of people from minority ethnic groups and those living in poverty. Our aim was to understand the experiences and perceptions of EOL dementia care amongst underserved groups and investigate how ethnicity and socioeconomic status influence experiences and perceptions of EOL dementia care. Ten workshops were held with a total of 29 Experts-by-Experience (EbE). All had professional and/or personal experience of care for people from disadvantaged groups living with dementia in England. The groups explored (i) current evidence gaps, (ii) barriers and facilitators to EOL care for PLWD across different ethnic and socioeconomic groups and (iii) recommendations for care and future research. The discussions were recorded, transcribed and the qualitative data analysed thematically. Data point to cultural, socioeconomic and systemic barriers to accessing quality EOL care for PLWD. EbE described how there is fear and stigma of talking about dementia and EOL care, and a mistrust of health and care services. Financial concerns were pervasive throughout the data and were described by EbE as significant drivers of inequalities in access to quality care. EbE from minority ethnic and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups report poor experiences of EOL dementia care. Our data suggests there is a need to improve multiple aspects of care, including access and coordination. Future research should work with underserved communities to co-produce culturally sensitive interventions to address inequalities in dementia EOL care.",Age and ageing,2025,Louise Tomkow; Marie Poole; Efioanwan Damisa; Barbara Hanratty; Faith Tissa; Malcolm Ngouala; Josie Dixon; Maria Karagiannidou; Margaret Ogden; Felicity Dewhurst
40552323,Research progress on microglial pyroptosis and inflammasomes: a comprehensive analysis.,"Microglial pyroptosis and inflammasome activation play critical roles in neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). In recent years, substantial attention has been directed toward elucidating their underlying mechanisms, diagnostic approaches, and prognostic implications. This study aimed to analyze the current research landscape, hotspots, and trends in this field. Articles published over the past decade on microglial pyroptosis and inflammasomes were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. A comprehensive analysis was conducted, and high-impact articles were examined in depth. A total of 958 articles were included. Among these, 664 originated from China, which also had the highest H-index (68), followed by 147 articles from the United States, with an H-index of 48 and the highest centrality (0.68). Southern Medical University (China) was the leading institution in terms of articles (47) and achieved the highest H-index (19). Journal of Neuroinflammation published the most articles (59) in this field. High-impact studies predominantly focused on the roles of microglial pyroptosis and inflammasomes in neurodegenerative diseases, neuroinflammation and therapeutic intervention strategies. Keywords such as ""depression,"" ""cell death,"" ""recovery,"" and ""pathogenesis"" emerged as research hotspots over the past 3 years. Microglial pyroptosis and inflammasome activation have become research hotspots in neurodegenerative disease, with China and the United States leading in article output and research influence in this field. Southern Medical University (China) is the most influential institution, and the <i>Journal of Neuroinflammation</i> is the most prolific journal. Current research hotspots emphasize elucidating the pathological mechanisms of microglial pyroptosis and inflammasome activation in neurodegenerative diseases, especially in AD, PD, and MS, and exploring potential therapeutic strategies such as MCC950, quercetin, MicroRNA-7, and melatonin. Future studies are expected to focus on mechanism elucidation, disease specificity, dynamic regulation, targeted interventions, and clinical translation to enhance treatment outcomes and prognosis for neurological disorders.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2025,Xiaofang Wang; Zhenyu Li; Bingxiang Ma; Qianfang Jia
40552321,Study protocol: The efficacy of mushroom to prevent cognitive decline in at-risk middle-aged adults and young-olds living in the community.,"Cognitive function declines with increasing age and maintaining high cognitive functioning especially at late life remains a challenging question to be addressed. Emerging evidence in the role of mushroom in promoting cognition has been produced from limited observational studies but there is a lack of definitive evidence on both longitudinal relationships from prospective cohort studies and clinical efficacy from clinical trials. To explore the definitive evidence of mushroom on cognitive functions among at-risk middle-aged and young-olds. The first study is a 10-year cognitive assessment follow-up on an existing cohort, the Diet and Healthy Aging (DaHA), which recruited over 1,000 older adults from the year 2010 to the year 2016. The second is a carefully designed randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the role of mushrooms in promoting cognitive functioning among around 600 middle-aged adults and young-olds. Participants were selected based on specific inclusion criteria, such as being community-living adults aged 45-74 years with a family history of dementia, APOE ε4 allele, or subjective cognitive decline, while consuming mushrooms no more than once a week and having no dementia, along with the exclusion of individuals with neurological or psychiatric disorders and significant sensory or motor impairments. Participants in the intervention group will consume Pleurotus citrinopileatus mushroom powder daily for 24 months, with compliance monitored using electronic diary apps. The powder contains 7.0 mg/g of ergothioneine (dry weight). Cognitive function including Mini Mental State Examination, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Symbol Digit Modality test, Clinical Dementia Rating etc. along with mental health and biological markers will be measured at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years after baseline.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2025,Jiatong Shan; Luwen Cao; Jiuyu Guo; Kai Xuan Lim; Na Li; Yinxia Chao; Yizhen Xie; Jian Chen; Wei Ma; Su Lin Lim; Irwin Kee-Mun Cheah; Mihir Gandhi; Tih-Shih Lee; Lei Feng; Kaisy Xinhong Ye
40552318,Innovating beyond electrophysiology through multimodal neural interfaces.,"Neural circuits distributed across different brain regions mediate how neural information is processed and integrated, resulting in complex cognitive capabilities and behaviour. To understand dynamics and interactions of neural circuits, it is crucial to capture the complete spectrum of neural activity, ranging from the fast action potentials of individual neurons to the population dynamics driven by slow brain-wide oscillations. In this Review, we discuss how advances in electrical and optical recording technologies, coupled with the emergence of machine learning methodologies, present a unique opportunity to unravel the complex dynamics of the brain. Although great progress has been made in both electrical and optical neural recording technologies, these alone fail to provide a comprehensive picture of the neuronal activity with high spatiotemporal resolution. To address this challenge, multimodal experiments integrating the complementary advantages of different techniques hold great promise. However, they are still hindered by the absence of multimodal data analysis methods capable of providing unified and interpretable explanations of the complex neural dynamics distinctly encoded in these modalities. Combining multimodal studies with advanced data analysis methods will offer novel perspectives to address unresolved questions in basic neuroscience and to develop treatments for various neurological disorders.",Nature reviews electrical engineering,2025,Mehrdad Ramezani; Yundong Ren; Ertugrul Cubukcu; Duygu Kuzum
40552311,Multi-atlas ensemble graph neural network model for major depressive disorder detection using functional MRI data.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common mental disorders, with significant impacts on many daily activities and quality of life. It stands as one of the most common mental disorders globally and ranks as the second leading cause of disability. The current diagnostic approach for MDD primarily relies on clinical observations and patient-reported symptoms, overlooking the diverse underlying causes and pathophysiological factors contributing to depression. Therefore, scientific researchers and clinicians must gain a deeper understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in MDD. There is growing evidence in neuroscience that depression is a brain network disorder, and the use of neuroimaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), plays a significant role in identifying and treating MDD. Rest-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is among the most popular neuroimaging techniques used to study MDD. Deep learning techniques have been widely applied to neuroimaging data to help with early mental health disorder detection. Recent years have seen a rise in interest in graph neural networks (GNNs), which are deep neural architectures specifically designed to handle graph-structured data like rs-fMRI. This research aimed to develop an ensemble-based GNN model capable of detecting discriminative features from rs-fMRI images for the purpose of diagnosing MDD. Specifically, we constructed an ensemble model by combining functional connectivity features from multiple brain region segmentation atlases to capture brain complexity and detect distinct features more accurately than single atlas-based models. Further, the effectiveness of our model is demonstrated by assessing its performance on a large multi-site MDD dataset. We applied the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) to handle class imbalance across sites. Using stratified 10-fold cross-validation, the best performing model achieved an accuracy of 75.80%, a sensitivity of 88.89%, a specificity of 61.84%, a precision of 71.29%, and an F1-score of 79.12%. The results indicate that the proposed multi-atlas ensemble GNN model provides a reliable and generalizable solution for accurately detecting MDD.",Frontiers in computational neuroscience,2025,Nojod M Alotaibi; Areej M Alhothali; Manar S Ali
40552310,Vesicular trafficking and cell-cell communication in neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration.,"Regulation of vesicle biology and trafficking plays a critical role in cell viability. Vesicular trafficking is a process that entails vesicle biogenesis, transport, and sorting of materials such as proteins, enzymes, hormones, and neurotransmitters to different cellular compartments. This phenomenon is especially important in cells of the central nervous system, including neural progenitors, neurons, and glial cell populations, because of their highly polarized architecture. In line with that, disruption in vesicular trafficking during cortical development affects progenitor proliferation and differentiation and leads to brain malformations. On the other hand, neuronal cells require long-range vesicular trafficking to reach distant locations, such as the distal part of the axons, and synaptic vesicles are essential for cell-cell communication. Neurons have high energy demands. Therefore, any malfunction in vesicular trafficking is a trigger to spiraling into neurodegeneration. Here, we give a comprehensive review of the role of intracellular and extracellular vesicles in cortical development and neurodegeneration, and we discuss how trafficking between organelles in specific cell types contributes to brain pathologies. Finally, we highlight the emerging evidence linking disruption in vesicular trafficking to neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and autism.",Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,2025,Salma Amin; Elena Taverna
40552281,TMEM115: a promising marker for glioma immunotherapy and prognosis.,"Glioma is a common malignant primary brain tumor characterized by a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and unfavorable prognosis. Transmembrane protein 115 (TMEM115) is a protein-coding gene. It may play a role in the retrograde transport of proteins from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum. At the same time, it may also play an indirect role in protein glycosylation at the Golgi. However, the role of TMEM115 in glioma progression is still unclear and, therefore, needs further exploration. RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas databases of glioma patients and multiplex Immunohistochemistry by glioma tissue microarrays were analyzed to determine the expression and localization of TMEM115. Functional assessment of TMEM115 involved cell proliferation, migration, and invasion assays. Pearson's test was utilized to evaluate the association between TMEM115 protein levels, tumor immune infiltrating cells, and immune checkpoints. In addition, χ<sup>2</sup> test and Cox regression analyses were performed to investigate whether TMEM115 protein expression is related to clinical characteristics and patient outcomes. The results revealed a significant increase in TMEM115 expression in tumors than in non-tumor brain tissues, and knockdown of TMEM115 affects the ability of glioma cell lines to proliferate, migrate, and invade. Additionally, a significant correlation between TMEM115 protein, M2 macrophages (CD68<sup>+</sup>CD163<sup>+</sup>), and programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1). Further analysis confirmed a correlation between TMEM115 protein expression in glioma tissues, World Health Organization Grade, and patients' poorer prognosis. These findings support TMEM115 as a potential independent prognostic biomarker in glioma and suggest its promise as a target for immunotherapy.",Frontiers in immunology,2025,Hang Yin; Feng Wang; Haiyan Xu; Manyu Xu; Pengpeng Lu; Xiaojing Zhang; Lei Yang; Bing Lu; Pingping Sun; Jianfei Huang
40552280,Tryptophan pathway profiling in multiple sclerosis patients treated with ocrelizumab.,"L-Tryptophan (Trp) metabolism is impaired across various chronic inflammatory pathologies, including Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Trp processing relies on three metabolic routes, namely Kynurenine, Serotonin and Indole pathways. The host microbiota significantly impacts Trp metabolism, primarily by being responsible for Indole metabolites production and secondarily by shaping both Kynurenine and Serotonin pathways. Pathological conditions and pharmaceutical treatments can elicit changes in microbial populations, leading to alterations in metabolites production and therefore determining rearrangements in host metabolism. Currently, no simultaneous exploration and comparison of all three Trp related metabolic routes has been performed in the context of MS patients before and after Ocrelizumab (OCR) treatment. By performing mass spectrometry on plasma samples collected from healthy controls and MS patients before and six months after OCR treatment we provided a comparative investigation of Trp metabolomics profile. Our data points out to concurrent alterations of Trp-related pathways among both OCR treated and untreated MS patients. Furthermore, MS treated patients presented a pattern resembling health state for various metabolites across the pathways. The results reported in our research may contribute to unveiling new perspectives and understanding regarding MS pathogenetic mechanisms.",Frontiers in immunology,2025,Carolina Ricci; Matteo Pivetta; Eleonora Martinis; Viviana Valeri; Carolina Colliva; Nicola Giacchè; Simone Lorenzut; Daniela Cargnelutti; Barbara Frossi; Silvia Tonon
40552243,Built environment factors and their impacts on outdoor walking activity among people living with dementia: a spatial analysis approach.,"As the population of people living with dementia in Canada continues to grow, understanding the built environment's role in facilitating outdoor activity is increasingly critical. While prior qualitative and quantitative research has established the benefits of outdoor walking for the physical, mental, and social well-being of people living with dementia, empirical spatial analysis of built environment factors influencing their walking behavior remains limited. This study serves as a proof of concept, demonstrating the feasibility of applying spatial analysis to assess the impact of built environment variables on outdoor walking among people living with dementia. Using data from 25 participants in Metro Vancouver, this study integrates Geographic Positioning System (GPS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) tracking with exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and multiple linear regression (MLR) to examine the relationship between built-environment characteristics and walking distances. Despite the small sample size, statistical analyses met standard validity criteria, identifying three key factors influencing walking distance: (1) Macro environment-accessibility to public transportation and street network characteristics (<i>p</i> = 0.007, 439.6 m increase), (2) Micro environment-pedestrian-oriented design (<i>p</i> = 0.065, 286.5 m increase), and (3) General characteristics-mixed land use and sidewalk suitability (<i>p</i> = 0.015, 388.5 m increase). These findings provide preliminary evidence of the built environment's role in shaping mobility for people living with dementia, offering valuable insights for public health policy makers, urban planners and designers, and transportation professionals in designing dementia-friendly neighborhoods. By integrating spatial analysis with environmental design principles, this study contributes to the development of inclusive and accessible urban environments for people living with dementia.",Frontiers in public health,2025,Mohammadjavad Nouri; Habib Chaudhury
40552234,Pre-COVID era pediatric disease incidence in Kazakhstan: regional panel data analysis of multiple disease groups (2010-2019).,"While child morbidity in Kazakhstan is studied, existing research often prioritizes mortality or infectious diseases over non-communicable conditions. This study fills this gap by examining socioeconomic, demographic, and healthcare factors linked to respiratory diseases, asthma, and nervous system disorders among children aged 0-14 years across Kazakhstan from 2010 to 2019 highlighting regional context. Panel data from 14 regions were analyzed using linear mixed models with autoregressive covariance to address regional and temporal heterogeneity. Log-transformed incidence rates of respiratory diseases (J00-J99), asthma (J45), and nervous system diseases (G00-G99) were modeled against predictors including GRP per capita, unemployment, population density, Gini coefficient, pediatrician density, and hospital resources. Other variables with variance inflation factors ≥5 were excluded to mitigate multicollinearity. Respiratory diseases showed the highest mean incidence (57,329.86 per 100,000), with significant regional variation. Aqtöbe, Atyrau, and South Kazakhstan had 12-25% lower incidence compared to Zhambyl (reference), while Pavlodar and North Kazakhstan had 35-61% higher rates. A 1% increase in population density correlated with a 1.05% decrease in respiratory disease incidence (<i>p</i> = 0.008), whereas unemployment was linked to a 0.41% rise (<i>p</i> = 0.029). Asthma incidence increased by 140% over the decade, with higher rates in regions with greater income inequality (0.26% increase per 1% rise in low-income households, <i>p</i> = 0.032). Nervous system disorders showed limited associations, with unemployment as the sole predictor (0.69% increase per 1% rise, <i>p</i> = 0.040). Temporal trends revealed declines in most diseases, but neoplasms, diabetes, and asthma increased significantly. The study addresses the lack of localized socioeconomic and healthcare analyses for respiratory diseases, asthma, and nervous system disorders among children, providing evidence for region-specific policy interventions. Respiratory diseases and asthma among Kazakhstani children 0-14 years had associations with the regional economic conditions, healthcare utilization, and inequality. Population density and income inequality were consistent predictors, while nervous system disorders showed fewer clear associations. Our findings show distinct regional patterns in pediatric morbidity, linking health outcomes to localized socioeconomic and healthcare conditions.",Frontiers in public health,2025,Nurlan Smagulov; Olzhas Zhamantayev; Aidar Aitkulov; Nurbek Yerdessov; Karina Nukeshtayeva; Zhanerke Bolatova; Zhyldyz Kurzhunbaeva
40552233,Behavioral intervention for mental health of pregnant women experiencing domestic violence: a randomized controlled trial.,"The intersection of domestic violence (DV) during pregnancy has multiple detrimental effects on the mother and family, resulting in mental health impairment. In a cognizant effort to empower pregnant women who have experienced DV, a Behavioral Intervention Package (BIP) was developed and used. The BIP incorporates yoga-based techniques for self-development, interpersonal skill development, and awareness sessions. The study aims to assess the effect of a BIP on the quality of life (QOL), DV, anxiety, depression, PTSD and coping mechanisms of Indian women experiencing violence during pregnancy. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving pregnant women experiencing DV and attending antenatal care (ANC) was conducted at Lok Nayak (LN) Hospital in New Delhi. It is a tertiary care government hospital that provides free maternal healthcare services and primarily caters to individuals from low and middle socio-economic status. Based on the inclusion criteria, 921 participants were screened, and finally, 211 women were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (<i>n</i> = 105) or the control group (<i>n</i> = 106). The intervention consisted of two components: (A) a BIP and (B) standard care. The intervention group received both A and B, while the control group received only B. The BIP, delivered over 11 sessions, aimed to empower women to attain better physical and mental health. Over the seven-month period, each participant in both groups attended 11 sessions to receive the full intervention package. The mean age of women in the intervention group was 25.3 years, and in the control group, it is 24.5 years. The intervention group showed significant improvements in QOL, with increases in physical (6.933 vs. -3.121) and mental health scores (7.802 vs. -3.623). Anxiety decreased (effect size 9.979), and there were significant reductions in depression scores (8.882), PTSD, and DV. Improvements in coping strategies (MD = 1.1, 95% CI = -1.47, -0.71) and social support (MD = 1.57) were also observed. The BIP can positively impact the mental health of pregnant women experiencing DV and attending ANC in India. As no standardized intervention exists for this population attending ANC in a hospital in India, integrating the BIP as an intervention during ANC is recommended.

40552218,"Unveiling barriers to maternal mental health in Pakistan: knowledge, attitudes and stigmas toward postpartum depression in social support systems.","Postpartum depression (PPD) poses a significant mental health concern for mothers globally. Despite a substantial prevalence, PPD often goes undetected and untreated, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) like Pakistan. This study assesses the knowledge and attitudes toward postpartum depression among the social support system of pregnant women in Pakistan. A cross-sectional study was conducted at three healthcare institutions in Pakistan, investigating the knowledge and attitudes surrounding PPD among the support system of gravidarum women. Participants included a diverse sample of 363 individuals, above 18 years forming the social support system for pregnant women. Data were collected through interviews using validated questionnaires, providing insights into their demographic profiles, knowledge, and attitudes toward PPD. IBM-SPSS version 26.0 was used for data analysis, employing statistical tests like Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, Spearman correlation to examine associations. The sample (<i>N</i> = 363) was demographically diverse, with participants aged 18-60 years, predominantly urban-dwelling (83.5%), educational levels ranged from uneducated (19.6%) to higher education (38%). Findings reveal a moderate level of awareness (44.6%) but a negative attitude (47.5%) toward PPD among participants. Stigmatizing concerns regarding disclosure highlights the need for non- judgmental support, while positive attitudes toward non-mystical explanations (Black Magic and Jinns) of PPD suggest progress in mental health understanding. This study highlights the need for targeted interventions to address the stigma surrounding PPD and promote supportive environments for pregnant women in Pakistan. Enhancing awareness and fostering open dialog about PPD within social support networks can play a crucial role in mitigating its impact on maternal mental health.",Frontiers in public health,2025,Jawaria Shahzad; Laiba Nazim; Laraib Hussain; Hurais Malik; Rozina Mustafa; Muhammad Usama Jamil; Muhammad Abdullah; Mah Zaib Masood Awaisi; Syed Hassan Ahmed; Abdul Rehman; Muhammad Hudaib; Ahmad Umais Ahad; Khabab Abbasher Hussien Mohamed Ahmed
40552213,Noncoding RNA and Alcohol Use Disorder: A Scoping Review of Current Research and Knowledge Gaps.,"Alcohol use and misuse can result in substantial disease burden and mortality, with significant public health and social costs. The need for better diagnoses and medications development for all conditions associated with alcohol use emphasizes the need for research into underlying molecular mechanisms. Noncoding ribonucleic acids (ncRNAs) are an explanatory mechanism for transducing environmental effects into cells and tissues. ncRNAs are regulatory RNAs that are diverse in size and function and greatly outnumber protein-coding RNAs in mammals. ncRNAs may play a major role in the pathogenesis and consequences of alcohol use and misuse, and studies in this area could pave the way to developing novel methods of diagnosis and therapy. This scoping review examines the extent, range, and nature of the research linking ncRNAs to alcohol, with a focus on identifying gaps in the existing literature. This scoping review followed the ""Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews."" Peer-reviewed journal articles for all species, including human, animal, or cells, published until December 2023, were included. Publications were retrieved using keyword searches in three online databases: Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), and Academic Search Ultimate (EBSCO). Identified articles were imported in Covidence systematic review software for screening. Each article was evaluated by at least two independent reviewers, and only those receiving votes from both were included in the review. Key findings were then extracted from the included studies, further analyzed, and summarized in a table and figures using Microsoft Excel. Details, including year of publication, species, sex, sample type, and sample processing methods for different types of ncRNAs (i.e., microRNAs [miRNAs], long noncoding RNAs [lncRNAs], circular RNAs [circRNAs]) were also reported. In total, 3,358 studies were identified and imported in Covidence. After removal of duplicates, 1,937 studies were processed for title and abstract screening, and 400 studies were subsequently selected for full-text screening. From these, 338 studies were included in the scoping review. In total, 3,020 initially captured studies were excluded. Among all ncRNAs, miRNAs were the most frequently investigated, followed by lncRNAs and circRNAs. Whereas many studies investigated ncRNA associations with alcohol phenotypes, mechanistic studies were more limited. Studies spanned pathologies related to alcohol use across tissues and organs, including liver, brain, heart, pancreas, placenta, gastrointestinal system, muscle, and bone. However, key variables, including biological sex, age, and genetic variation, were not adequately addressed. The analyses uncovered significant gaps in the research literature, relating primarily to underlying mechanisms. The field of ncRNA research in pathologies associated with alcohol use is still emerging. Given the enormous sizes and species variations of mammalian ncRNA genomes, a significant amount of research is needed to identify relevant ncRNAs in different organs, and at all stages of pathology, and to identify underlying mechanisms. Initial studies show promise that ncRNA research could significantly improve the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol use disorder.",Alcohol research : current reviews,2025,Deepa Upreti; Rosaline P Kumar; Justin B J Chen; Sneha L Sonti; Abigail V Bowring; Sheila W Green; Rajesh C Miranda

The primary outcomes assessed were dynamic balance and motor function, with secondary outcomes including fall risk. <b>Results:</b> Six studies, encompassing 198 participants, were included in this review. They demonstrated significant improvements in dynamic balance and motor function following Frenkel exercise interventions. Five studies reported enhanced balance, measured by the Berg Balance Scale and timed up and go test. Frenkel exercises also contributed to a reduced fall risk and improved mobility. Consistent with other studies, our results show that Frenkel exercises effectively boost self-confidence and physical function. <b>Conclusion:</b> Frenkel exercises improve dynamic balance and motor function while lowering fall risk in elderly individuals with neurological disorders. Its simplicity and low cost make it a practical option, but more long-term studies are needed to confirm these benefits.",Journal of aging research,2025,Alireza Vasiee; Faraz Tayyar-Iravanlou; Fatemeh Rahmani; Azin Zeidani; MohammadHossein Sahami Gilan
40552150,The role of Poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) enzymes in chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairments - parallels with other neurodegenerative disorders.,"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes are critical in repairing DNA damage induced by chemotherapy and/or radiation. Due to PARP's role in DNA repair, inhibiting PARP leads to genomic instability and accumulation of damaged cells in cell cycle arrest. Previous studies have shown that PARP1 activation contributes to the development of various malignant disorders, and using PARP inhibitors is a promising intervention in these diseases. However, PARP activation is also common in neurological and inflammatory disorders. PARP inhibitors were studied in preclinical models of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In neurodegenerative disorders like AD, activated PARP1 induces Aβ and forms Tau tangles, worsening cognitive symptoms. PARP inhibitors are currently used in combination therapy with chemotherapy drugs, including cisplatin and temozolomide, which are all described as having significant rates of central and peripheral nervous system side-effects, raising the potential question of using PARP inhibition not only as a cancer treatment but as an approach to mitigate the toxicity of the cancer drugs. This review will summarize evidence for the potential use of PARP inhibitors for neurologic disorders and discuss future prospects of how PARP inhibitors could be repurposed as neuroprotective agents against the cognitive complications of chemotherapeutic drugs.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2025,Dahlia A Ordaz; Kalpna Gupta; Daniela A Bota
40552124,<i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i>-induced periodontitis promotes neuroinflammation and neuronal loss associated with dysfunction of the brain barrier.,"In our previous study, <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i> (<i>P. gingivalis</i>)-induced periodontitis caused cognitive impairment which was associated with abnormal amyloid β (Aβ) metabolite in the brain. The brain barrier is critical in maintaining homeostasis, controlling influx and efflux transport and regulating waste clearance. However, the specific role of the brain barrier in linking periodontitis to cognitive function remains unclear. A murine model of periodontitis-induced cognitive impairment was constructed via oral topical application of <i>P. gingivalis.</i> Neuroinflammation was observed by detecting the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and glia activation. Western blot (WB), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) were used to detect the expression of tau-related molecules and neuronal loss. WB, Evans blue staining and flow cytometry were used to evaluate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) function including the infiltration of <i>P. gingivalis</i> and immune cells, and BBB permeability. The changes of meningeal lymphatic drainage were observed using an in vivo animal imaging system and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The effect of <i>P. gingivalis</i> on lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) was further verified using IF and RT-PCR. <i>P. gingivalis</i>-induced periodontitis exacerbated cognitive impairment by the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine and glia activation. In the brain of periodontitis mice, p-Akt and p-GSK3β levels were reduced, leading to tau hyperphosphorylation and neuronal loss including cell bodies and neurites. <i>P. gingivalis</i>-induced periodontitis enhanced BBB permeability, promoted P. gingivalis and immune cell infiltration, and downregulated the expression of Occludin and ZO-1. In addition, the meningeal lymphatic drainage was impaired and the mRNA levels of lymphangiogenesis-related factor LYVE1 were decreased in the dura matter of periodontitis mice. After <i>P. gingivalis</i> infection, the inflammatory response was increased, and LYVE1 and ZO1 expression was decreased in LECs. Periodontitis aggravated neuroinflammation and neuronal loss which was associated with tau hyperphosphorylation. The impaired meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLV) and disrupted BBB affected the brain barrier function, further inhibiting the clearance of pathogenic substances and enhancing immune cell infiltration in periodontitis mice. These results indicated that brain barrier dysfunction may be the link between periodontitis and cognitive impairment.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2025,Yiting Jiang; Lina Xu; Xuri Zhao; Hui Shen; Che Qiu; Zhiyan He; Zhongchen Song; Wei Zhou
40552120,A multi-omics study of magnesium sulfate to improve prognosis in sepsis-related encephalopathy: integrating clinical data-driven network pharmacology.,"Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) constitutes a significant neurological manifestation of sepsis, characterized by high mortality rates and posing a critical threat to patient outcomes. Magnesium sulfate has multiple effects in the nervous system, including neuroprotection, sedation, anticonvulsant activity, enhanced neuroplasticity, anti - inflammation and promotion of nerve repair. It can regulate calcium homeostasis, exert antioxidant effects, and reduce the release of inflammatory factors, thereby alleviating neuronal damage and neurological deficits. This study integrated MIMIC-IV database and network pharmacology to explore magnesium sulfate's neuroprotective mechanisms and clinical impact on SAE outcomes. Retrospective data from 4,650 SAE patients in MIMIC-IV 3.0 were analyzed. Propensity score matching balanced covariates. Cox models and Kaplan-Meier curves evaluated magnesium sulfate's association with 28-day all-cause mortality (ACM). Network pharmacology identified magnesium sulfate's core targets and pathways. 4183 patients (89.96%) received magnesium sulfate during ICU, while 467 (10.04%) did not receive. The 28-day ACM in patients with SAE was 11.05%. After propensity score matching participants with and without magnesium sulfate administration had 28-day ACM of 17.29% and 30.42%, respectively (P < 0.001). Magnesium sulfate administration was associated with reduced 28-day ACM. Subgroup analysis revealed this association differed in several stratification. Network pharmacology revealed magnesium sulfate targets TNF, IL6, IL1B and CXCL8, modulating pathways including inflammatory response, immune regulation, and cellular stress. Magnesium sulfate use correlates with improved SAE survival, particularly those with comorbid chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute kidney injury, and using vasoconstrictors, likely through multi-target modulation of inflammatory response and immune regulation. Prospective studies are needed for validation.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2025,Yingming Kong; Yanghao Tai; Bin Chen; Meng Zhang; Haoyu Ji; Rongke Feng; Liang Shi; Hao Chen
40552019,Cystamine reduces neurodegeneration and epileptogenesis following soman-induced status epilepticus in rats.,"Acute exposure to a seizure-inducing dose of an organophosphorus nerve agent inhibits acetylcholinesterase, leading to pharmacoresistance if benzodiazepine treatment is delayed. Following soman-induced status epilepticus (SE) in rats, prolonged seizure is associated with severe and widespread neurodegeneration. We evaluated the aminothiol cystamine, the oxidized form of cysteamine, for neuroprotective potential against soman-induced SE and associated neurodegeneration. Cystamine has a myriad of effects including antioxidant properties, neuroprotective effects, and immunomodulation, among others, which is of interest in evaluating neuroprotective efficacy against cholinergic-induced neurodegeneration. Adult male rats implanted with telemetry transmitters for continuous EEG recording were exposed to soman and treated with the muscarinic antagonist atropine sulfate and the oxime asoxime dimethanesulfonate 1 min after exposure to increase survival. Midazolam was administered 30 min after seizure onset. Cystamine (10 or 50 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered 30 min after seizure onset and again 4 h after soman exposure. The initial seizure duration, the EEG power integral at 6 h after exposure, and the percentage of rats that developed spontaneous recurrent seizure were reduced in rats treated with cystamine, compared to those that received only midazolam. In addition, cystamine reduced neurodegeneration in seizure-sensitive brain regions following soman exposure, compared to midazolam. Our findings highlight the potential for aminothiols to serve as adjunctive therapy to midazolam in treating cholinergic-induced toxicity and suggest broader applications of aminothiols in neuroprotection and neurological disorders.","Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",2025,Abiel K Biney; Caroline R Schultz; Michael F Stone; Donna A Nguyen; Annie Wang; Marcio de Araujo Furtado; Lucille A Lumley
40552018,Deep brain stimulation for dystonia treatment in cerebral palsy: efficacy exploration.,"Dystonia, a challenging movement disorder, poses significant therapeutic challenges due to its resistance to treatment, resulting in both physical impairment and substantial mental distress, ultimately impacting overall quality of life. Cerebral palsy (CP) is a major non-genetic cause of secondary dystonia, characterized by diverse clinical presentations. This study aims to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a therapeutic intervention for individuals with dystonic CP. We conducted a systematic analysis of studies assessing the safety and effectiveness of DBS, with a focus on its long-term outcomes [PROSPERO (Unique identifier: CRD42023399285)]. We examined factors that influence treatment response and proposed strategies to enhance patient quality of life. DBS, especially when targeting the basal ganglia or innovative targets, shows promise as a therapeutic approach for dystonic CP. While existing controlled studies confirm its safety and effectiveness, a thorough evaluation of long-term efficacy remains crucial. This research highlights the potential of DBS in improving the lives of individuals with dystonic CP, providing hope for further refinement, innovation, and broader clinical application of this therapeutic approach.","Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",2025,Haoyang Zheng; Duo Zhang; Wei Xiang; Yong Gan; Zesheng Peng; Yuyi Wu; Peng Fu
40552006,PKC in the perspective of dopamine receptor signaling.,"Protein kinase C (PKC) is widely distributed in various tissues, organs, and cells. By catalyzing the phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues on various proteins, PKC regulates the metabolism, growth, proliferation, and differentiation of multiple cells and plays a crucial role in transmembrane signal transmission. In dopamine receptor signal transduction, PKC regulates numerous physiological functions, such as dopamine release, internalization of the dopamine transporter, downregulation of dopamine receptors, etc. In disease conditions, hyperactivation of PKC can lead to disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease, while reduced PKC signaling may be associated with Alzheimer's disease. In the past few decades, researchers have paid increasing attention to the transduction role of PKC in dopamine receptor signaling, aiming to identify and discover potential targets for dopaminergic diseases. This review, from the perspective of signal transduction between dopamine receptors and PKC, reveals the pivotal hub position of PKC in the intracellular signal transduction network and its regulation of various physiological functions, providing ideas for future research on PKC and therapeutic interventions for dopaminergic diseases.",Acta biochimica Polonica,2025,Haixiang Ma
40551989,"PANoptosis: Cross-Talk Among Apoptosis, Necroptosis, and Pyroptosis in Neurological Disorders.","Cell death mechanisms play a critical role in organismal development and homeostasis, primarily categorized into energy-dependent programmed cell death (PCD) and energy-independent necrotic cell death. PCD, regulated through various forms such as apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and autophagic cell death, is essential for maintaining tissue stability and eliminating abnormal cells. Dysregulation of PCD is associated with numerous diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Recent studies have revealed extensive crosstalk and coordination among classical cell death pathways, leading to the identification of a novel programmed cell death mode termed PANoptosis. PANoptosis involves the dynamic assembly of the PANoptosome complex, which simultaneously activates apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis pathways in response to pathogen infection or tissue damage. In neurological diseases, PANoptosis exhibits dual roles: it can eliminate pathogen-infected cells but may also exacerbate neuroinflammation and neuronal death, contributing to the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. This review critically evaluates the molecular mechanisms of PANoptosis, its dual roles in neurological diseases (eg, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and glioma), and potential therapeutic strategies targeting PANoptosis, including small-molecule inhibitors, genome editing, and delivery technologies. By addressing conflicting evidence and outstanding questions, this review aims to provide a comprehensive framework for future research and clinical applications. Future research should focus on elucidating the molecular regulatory networks of PANoptosis, developing specific inhibitors, and advancing clinical applications to provide novel insights into the precise treatment of neurological diseases.",Journal of inflammation research,2025,Pengpeng Li; Yangyang Gao; Zhenxing Tao; Zhenqian Mu; Shiqing Du; Xudong Zhao
40551967,Phenotypic Characterization of ALS-Causing SOD1 Mutations Affecting Polypeptide Length.,"<b>Background:</b> Some 234 mutations in the small <i>SOD1</i> gene have been reported to cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, the pathogenic mechanisms, particularly of those mutations affecting polypeptide length, are contested. It is presently unknown whether all reported nonsense mutations in SOD1 are causative for ALS. The emergence of promising new anti-SOD1 drugs has made it imperative to gain further insight into clinical-genetic aspects of ALS for deciding which patients to treat in clinical practice and include in drug trials. <b>Objective:</b> This study is aimed at comprehensively analyzing the clinical phenotypes associated with ALS-causing SOD1 mutations that alter the polypeptide length. The specific focus is on the age at which symptoms manifest and the survival duration. <b>Methods:</b> Data were collected from web databases, published reports, conference presentations, and personal communications up to November 2023. The clinical endpoints, including age at symptom onset and age at death, were subjected to survival analysis. Comparative analyses were performed between frameshift and nonframeshift variants. <b>Results:</b> A cohort of 146 ALS patients harboring 38 different nonmissense <i>SOD1</i> variants was analyzed. The mean age of disease onset was 46.9 years, with a mean survival duration of 49 months. Significant heterogeneity was observed in clinical outcomes, with earlier disease onset and reduced survival associated with specific mutations. Notably, frameshift mutations proximal to the N-terminus showed a higher risk of early ALS onset compared to more distal mutations. <b>Conclusions:</b> The clinical phenotypes of ALS patients with nonmissense SOD1 mutations are highly variable and dependent on the specific mutation. These findings underscore the necessity of including diverse <i>SOD1</i> mutation carriers in therapeutic trials and suggest that both loss-of-function and gain-of-function mechanisms may contribute to ALS pathology.",Human mutation,2025,Mariusz Berdyński; Krzysztof Safranow; Peter M Andersen; Cezary Żekanowski
40551933,Disseminated Nocardiosis: Poorly Controlled Diabetes as an Immunocompromising State.,"<i>Nocardia</i> species are environmental pathogens that cause rare infections, primarily affecting immunocompromised individuals. These infections can present as pulmonary, cutaneous, or disseminated diseases, often involving the central nervous system. The most common portal of entry is via inhalation or skin breakdown; it is often found in soil, water, and vegetable matter. While typically associated with organ transplantation, malignancy, and immunosuppressive therapy, this case highlights how poorly controlled diabetes may also function as an immunocompromised state, therefore increasing susceptibility to severe <i>Nocardia</i> infections.  We present a case of a 74-year-old man with poorly controlled type two diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) greater than 8% who developed a diffuse vesicular rash, altered mental status, and generalized muscle aches. During hospitalization, imaging revealed bilateral lung nodules with cavitation and focal brain enhancement. He was initially treated for a disseminated varicella-zoster virus infection. However, further infectious workup, including molecular testing and tissue culture, confirmed <i>Nocardia</i> infection. The patient demonstrated significant clinical improvement with intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and was discharged on a prolonged course of oral antibiotics.  This case focuses on uncontrolled diabetes as a potential immunocompromising condition that may increase the risk of <i>Nocardia</i> infection. The initial misdiagnosis underscores the diagnostic challenges of this rare disease, particularly in patients without overt immunosuppression. Given the rising global prevalence of diabetes, clinicians should maintain a broad differential when evaluating diabetic patients with systemic illness and unexplained neurological symptoms. Early recognition and targeted treatment of nocardiosis can prevent severe complications, including central nervous system involvement.",Cureus,2025,Danielle G Iben; Emily Dobrzynski; Ritu Garg
40551892,Correlation between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and peripheral neuropathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"To investigate the correlation between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and to evaluate its predictive value for DPN. Participants were divided into three groups based on 25(OH)D levels: deficient, insufficient, and normal. The relationship between 25(OH)D and DPN, as well as the correlation of 25(OH)D and DPN with various indicators, was analyzed. Compared to the non-DPN group (NDPN), the DPN group had significantly lower levels of 25(OH)D3 (22.10 ± 0.77 vs. 24.45 ± 0.66 ng/mL) and total 25(OH)D (23.12 ± 0.74 vs. 25.68 ± 0.67 ng/mL). In addition, significant differences were observed in body mass index (BMI), resting heart rate (RHR), triglyceride (TG), free triiodothyronine (FT3), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) between the two groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Multivariate analysis identified 25(OH)D3, total 25(OH)D, FT3, BMI, and RHR as risk factors for DPN. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that the optimal cutoff value for 25(OH)D3 in predicting DPN in T2DM was 18.85 ng/mL [area under the curve (AUC) 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.697-8.823], while the optimal cutoff for total 25(OH)D was 19.94 ng/mL (AUC 0.765, 95% CI: 0.703-0.828). Serum 25(OH)D levels can serve as a simple and effective screening tool to predict the occurrence of DPN in patients with T2DM.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2025,Senzhen Chen; Jinfeng Chen; Shujing Zheng; Yiling Yan; Mengting Huang; Nuoqi Chen
40551882,Feasibility and acceptability of combining cognitive remediation and tDCS in long-term psychiatric clinical care.,"Cognitive impairments are commonly experienced by individuals with severe mental illness (SMI) and are associated with problems in everyday life. This pragmatic, randomized, controlled, pilot trial explored the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effects of cognitive remediation (CR) combined with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for cognitive and everyday functioning in individuals with SMI in long-term psychiatric clinical care. We hypothesized that combining CR and tDCS is feasible and acceptable to individuals with SMI. Twenty-four individuals with SMI were randomized to either CR + active tDCS (<i>n</i> = 13) or CR + sham tDCS (<i>n</i> = 11) over 32 sessions (16 weeks). Acceptability was evaluated in semi-structured interviews. Cognitive and everyday functioning were evaluated at baseline, post-16 week waiting period, post-intervention, and 6-months post-intervention. Overall, participants were positive about the training. Over 60 % of participants successfully finished at least 20 sessions, meeting the predefined criteria for feasibility. CR appeared to yield subjective improvements to participants, significant improvements in cognitive tests post-intervention and at follow-up and improved self-reported negative symptoms at follow-up. Observer-rated everyday functioning and cognition, and subjective cognitive complaints did not change following CR. This study concludes that CR is an acceptable and feasible intervention for individuals with SMI in long-term psychiatric clinical care. The addition of tDCS requires further investigation to ascertain its potential benefits.",Schizophrenia research.

40551820,"A teaching tool for tic disorders: using ""disinhibition"" to unify the spectrum.","Chronic Tic Disorders (CTDs) including Tourette's Disorder are common pediatric conditions that, like many other mental health conditions, are under-recognized and under-managed in the primary care setting. Pediatric Primary Care Providers (PCPs) often feel undertrained in mental health evaluation and management, but the Medical Home partnership between PCPs and their patients and families usually serves as the most available opportunity for timely and comprehensive assessment and care coordination of mental health concerns; PCPs and families may feel confused, surprised, and bewildered by the wide range in the clinical presentations of tics and their seemingly dissimilar coexisting conditions that appear to blur the margins between mental health and neurology. This article endeavors to teach PCPs - who can thereby teach families of children with CTDs - a general clear and understandable principle that bridges mental and behavioral health with neurophysiology. This principle is one of ""disinhibition,"" which is believed to underpin tic behaviors and a variety of symptoms of frequent coexisting conditions. The teaching approach set out in this article is schematic and takes advantage of active learning methods. Once understood, families and PCPs can then use their knowledge of disinhibition to help prioritize concerns and engage with greater purpose and direction in management of symptoms, anticipation of possible symptom evolution, and to advocate more persuasively for appropriate educational or related services when indicated.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2025,Samuel H Zinner
40551817,Altered static and dynamic functional connectivity in major depressive disorder accompanied by high anxiety: evidence from the REST-meta-MDD consortium.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent mental health condition characterized by persistent low mood, diminished interest in pleasurable activities, and anhedonia. Some patients with depression experience high levels of anxiety, complicating clinical treatment. However, the underlying pathological mechanisms remain unclear. The sample comprised 178 participants, including 73 MDD with high anxiety symptom subjects, 55 MDD with low anxiety symptom, and 50 healthy controls registered from multiple sites based on the REST-meta-MDD Project in China. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data were recorded. Large-scale static and dynamic functional connectivity analyses were conducted to identify specific brain connectivity distinguishing MDD with low and high anxiety symptoms. While MDD patients with high and low anxiety symptoms exhibit overlapping alterations in dynamic functional connectivity between the auditory cortex and nodes of the salience network, their distinct clinical profiles may be associated with differential functional connectivity patterns between the components of the default mode network (DMN) and the visual network (VN), as well as between the components of the basal ganglia network (BGN) and VN. The VN-DMN-BGN functional circuit may help elucidate the underlying pathological mechanisms associated with varying levels of anxiety in depressive disorders. Understanding this neural correlation could contribute to the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for MDD.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2025,Lujun Li; Zhijun Zeng; Yaling Zhou; Jinfei Lin; Jiayuan Li
40551816,Association between overactive bladder and suicidal ideation in US adults: a population-based study.,"Suicidal ideation, a critical public health issue, is notably associated with mental health disorders. Overactive bladder (OAB), a prevalent urological disorder, significantly impacts patients' quality of life and is associated with mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. This study investigates the association between OAB and suicidal ideation in US adults. This population-based cross-sectional study utilized data from six consecutive NHANES datasets (2007-2018). Suicidal ideation was assessed using the ninth item of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and OAB was identified through a simplified Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS). Multivariate logistic regression models, Restricted Cubic Splines, and subgroup analyses were used to analyze. The association between OAB and suicidal ideation, adjusting for potential confounders. Among the 28,085 participants, 3.30% reported suicidal ideation, and 20.39% were identified with OAB. Individuals with suicidal ideation had a significantly higher prevalence of OAB compared to those without suicidal ideation. After adjusting for covariates, each point increase in OABSS was associated with a 15% higher likelihood of suicidal ideation (OR=1.15, 95% CI: 1.10-1.20). Participants with OAB had a 47% increased likelihood of suicidal ideation compared to those without OAB (OR=1.47, 95% CI: 1.26-1.72). Subgroup analysis proved the robustness of the results of this study. The findings indicate a significant positive association between OAB and suicidal ideation in US adults. These findings underscore the necessity of integrating urological and mental health care to enhance suicide prevention strategies.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2025,Heng Liu; Huqiang Dong; Mingchu Jin; Yu Zhou; Haidong Hao; Yutang Yuan; Hongtao Jia; Junyong Li

40551742,The role of nutrition and gut microbiome in childhood brain development and behavior.,"The intricate relationship between nutrition, the gut microbiome, and brain development has garnered significant attention in recent years, concerning its implications for child behavior and cognitive function. The gut-brain axis mediates this relationship through microbial modulation of inflammation, neuroactive compounds, and blood-brain barrier integrity, particularly during prenatal and early postnatal periods. Healthy dietary patterns such as whole foods, high-fiber foods, and minimally processed foods play a crucial role in shaping the gut microbiota, promoting microbial diversity and overall gut health. As a result, a balanced and diverse microbiome supports healthy brain function and development. Furthermore, disruptions in gut microbiota composition have been linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders in children, including autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and anxiety. By integrating findings from animal models, clinical trials, and epidemiological studies, this review summarizes current advances on how early-life nutrition and gut microbiota interaction influence brain development and childhood behaviors. Ultimately, this paper underscores the potential for dietary interventions to promote optimal neurodevelopmental health and address behavioral issues in children.",Frontiers in nutrition,2025,Yue Jiang; Yuanyuan Li
40551736,"Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3): efficacy, safety, and implications in public health.","Vitamin D₃ (cholecalciferol) is a fat-soluble secosteroid with essential roles in calcium-phosphorus metabolism, bone health, and an expanding range of extraskeletal processes. Upon synthesis in the skin via ultraviolet B exposure or ingestion from dietary sources, cholecalciferol is hydroxylated in the liver and kidneys to form its active metabolite, calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D), which exerts pleiotropic effects through vitamin D receptor (VDR)-mediated genomic and non-genomic pathways. This narrative review synthesizes evidence on the systemic effects of high-dose cholecalciferol on bone health, metabolism, cardiovascular and immune function, and its emerging roles in neurological, gastrointestinal, reproductive, oncologic, and psychiatric disorders. High-dose vitamin D₃ has demonstrated benefits in specific populations, including improved bone mineral density, immune homeostasis, glycemic control, and reduced inflammation. In patients with chronic kidney disease, cystic fibrosis, and inflammatory bowel disease, targeted supplementation has been associated with clinical improvements. Preclinical models support calcitriol's antiproliferative and neuroprotective functions, and its synergistic effects with chemotherapy, although large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have yielded mixed or inconclusive results, particularly in cancer, cardiovascular events, and cognitive decline. Methodological variability-such as inconsistent dosing regimens, baseline vitamin D status, and heterogeneous populations-limits definitive conclusions. While vitamin D supplementation is generally safe within recommended limits, excessive intake may cause hypercalcemia or nephrolithiasis, emphasizing the need for personalized strategies. Food fortification and targeted screening remain underutilized yet cost-effective public health interventions. Overall, vitamin D₃ represents a promising but complex therapeutic agent, necessitating further rigorously designed clinical trials to establish evidence-based guidelines for its use in diverse pathological conditions.",Frontiers in nutrition,2025,Esteban Ortiz-Prado; Jorge Vasconez-Gonzalez; Juan S Izquierdo-Condoy; Isaac A Suárez-Sangucho; José Guillermo Prieto-Marín; Karen Bereniss Villarreal-Burbano; Mateo Alejandro Barriga-Collantes; John Alexander Altamirano-Castillo; Domenic Anahi Borja-Mendoza; Jean Carlo Pazmiño-Almeida; María Paz Cadena-Padilla

We conducted an inductive thematic analysis of the written descriptions of indirect intrusions reported in the offspring sample and related to WWII survivor experiences.<b>Results:</b> The analysis indicated the following themes: Cruelty (with several subthemes), Perspective (first or third person), Sensory perceptions, and Emotions.<b>Conclusions:</b> Offspring mostly described intrusions about WWII as visual cruel images from a first-person perspective, provoking distress and other strong emotions. Indirect intrusions may signify intergenerational consequences of parental traumatic events. Therefore, special attention is needed to the presence and content of indirect intrusions among offspring of survivors of wars or other traumatic events.",European journal of psychotraumatology,2025,Patricia Dashorst; Trudy Mooren; Wencke Donath; Anne Blonk; Rolf Kleber; Peter de Jong; Rafaele Huntjens
40551682,Innovative Approaches to Neural Differentiation: Chondroitin 4-Sulfate and Chondroitinase Induce Differentiation in Human-induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.,"Stem cells have recently gained prominence in regenerative medicine, particularly in the treatment of neurological disorders. As a result, Human-induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hiPSCs) have become a significant focus. This study aimed to differentiate hiPSCs into neural lineages under in vitro conditions using forskolin and retinoic acid in an induction medium combined with chondroitin 4-sulfate and chondroitinase. Optimal component concentrations were determined using the MTT assay and acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining. Subsequently, neural-specific genes (NSE, MAP-2, β-tubulin III, Oligo-2, and GFAP) and proteins (gamma enolase, MAP-2, and β-tubulin III) were assessed using Real-time PCR analysis and immunofluorescence staining to provide a comprehensive evaluation of differentiated cells. Our study demonstrated a significant enhancement in neural-specific gene and protein markers during the 7th and 14th days of differentiation in the presence of combined chondroitin 4-sulfate and chondroitinase, demonstrating a higher efficacy compared with the application of isolated enzymes or substrates. These findings emphasize the potential importance of chondroitin 4-sulfate and chondroitinase as important factors in promoting the neural differentiation of hiPSCs. It seems that chondroitin 4-sulfate may activate cellular signaling pathways that are effective in inducing neural differentiation. Our findings in this research provide new opportunities to advance regenerative therapies for neurological disorders.",Current stem cell research & therapy,2025,Mohsen Ghiasi; Mohammad-Taher Moradi; Raheleh Halabian; Marzieh Ghollasi; Abdolreza Dayani
40551671,The effect of cannabidiol on neurometabolite levels in alcohol use disorder.,"Preclinical research demonstrates that cannabidiol (CBD) attenuates alcohol-seeking behaviour and may have a neuroprotective effect against adverse alcohol consequences on the brain. This preliminary clinical study aimed to examine the effect of CBD on modulating neurometabolites in individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). Twenty-two non-treatment seeking participants were randomized to receive 800 mg CBD or matched placebo/day in a crossover double-blind, randomized trial. Presence of GABA+, NAA, Glx, Cho, and glutathione (GSH) in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex was measured using in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in each session. There were no significant treatment effects across each of the neurometabolites (p's ≥ .28) but post hoc analyses revealed significant treatment effects when considering recent alcohol consumption. Specifically, CBD sessions were associated with significantly higher GSH (P < .001) and GLx (p = .001) concentrations relative to placebo sessions for participants who consumed alcohol the previous day while this effect was not observed in those who were abstinent. Similarly, GABA concentrations were significantly higher during CBD sessions and lower during placebo sessions for participants who consumed alcohol the previous day and this relationship was not observed for individuals who were abstinent the previous day (P = .0024).

Acupuncture adjusts the microbiota-gut-brain axis through regulating the structure and metabolic state of gut microbiota, improving the intestinal microenvironment, restoring the stability of intestinal mucosal barrier and blood-brain barrier, stimulating vagus nerve, reducing inflammation and modulating neurotransmitters, so that nervous system diseases, mental diseases, digestive system diseases and metabolic diseases can be treated. With the latest research trends and the cutting-edge technologies considered, the studies in the future should deepen the mechanism of acupuncture on the physiological pathway for modulating the structure and composition of gut microbiota as well as its holistic elaboration.",Zhen ci yan jiu = Acupuncture research,2025,Min Xing; Li-Na Qiao; Hong-Ye Wan; Yong-Sheng Yang
40551656,[Advances of researches on acupuncture treatment of Parkinson's disease by regulating mitochondrial function].,"The pathological mechanism of Parkinson's disease (PD) is complex and affected by multi-system and multi-level factors including mitochondrial dysfunction (MD). It has been demonstrated that all patients with PD have a marked loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantial nigra pars compacta, and MD is an important initial factor causing dopaminergic neuron degeneration. Clinical practice has shown that acupuncture has a positive role in the treatment of PD. In the present article, we summed up recent research results about the mechanisms of acupuncture underlying improvement of PD from the standpoint of mitochondrial function. Acupuncture has been shown to be able in improving mitochondrial function, and restoring mitochondrial homeostasis, and protecting the normal morphological structure of mitochondria. It can also regulate the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1α), adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and Sirtuins (SIRT) to take part in mitochondrial biogenesis; decrease the levels of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), and mitochondrial fission protein 1 (Fis1) protein to preserve mitochondrial dynamic stability; and modulate the expression of PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), Parkin, P62, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3Ⅱ (LC3Ⅱ), and Beclin1 to promote autophagy. In addition, through controlling mitochondrial energy metabolism, preserving calcium homeostasis, reducing oxidative stress, and preventing neuronal apoptosis, acupuncture can also help improve mitochondrial dysfunction and prevent the onset and progression of PD. However, more researches are warranted to fully unravel the underlying mechanisms of acupuncture intervention before it can be popularized in clinical settings.",Zhen ci yan jiu = Acupuncture research,2025,Ru-Qi Zhang; Bing-Xu Zhu; Xiao-Jie Dong; Lin Chen; Sheng-Chun Wang

40551651,[Observation on the clinical efficacy on dyspepsia after ischemic stroke treated with elongated needle].,"To observe the effect of elongated needle, filiform needle and medication for attenuating belching, nausea and vomiting in patients with dyspepsia after ischemic stroke. A total of 102 patients with dyspepsia after ischemic stroke were randomly divided into an elongated needle group (34 cases, 1 case dropped out), a filiform needle group (34 cases), and a medication group (34 cases, 2 cases dropped out). In the elongated needle group, the elongated needle with the length of 125 mm was inserted perpendicularly at Zhongwan (CV12), Qihai (CV6), Liangmen (ST21, bilateral) and Tianshu (ST25, bilateral). After inserted with the depth of 70 mm to 90 mm, the needle was lifted beneath the skin, with the depth of 45 mm to 75 mm. In the filiform needle group, the filiform needle, with the length of 40 mm was used and inserted perpendicularly at CV12, CV6, ST21 (bilateral) and ST25 (bilateral), with the depth of 20 mm to 30 mm. Acupuncture therapy was delivered once daily, 6 times a week for 2 weeks in these two groups. In the medication group, domperidone was prescribed orally, 10 mg each time, 3 times a day, for 2 weeks. The scores of Leeds dyspepsia questionnaire (LDQ), Nepean dyspepsia life quality index (NDLQI) and the dyspepsia symptom of TCM were evaluated before and after treatments. The clinical efficacy was compared among the 3 groups and the safety was evaluated. After treatment, the scores of LDQ and TCM dyspepsia symptom decreased markedly compared with the baseline (<i>P</i><0.05), and NDLQI score increased (<i>P</i><0.05) in the 3 groups. After treatment, when compared with the filiform needle group and the medication group, the scores of LDQ and TCM dyspepsia symptom were decreased in the elongated needle group (<i>P</i><0.05) and the NDLQI score was increased (<i>P</i><0.05). The total effective rate was 93.94% (31/33), 76.47% (26/34) and 71.88% (23/32) in the elongated needle group, the filiform needle group and the medication group, respectively. The total effective rate in the elongated needle group was superior to either the filiform needle group or the medication group (<i>P</i><0.05). The serious adverse reaction was not found and the safety was high in the 3 groups. Elongated needling therapy with deep insertion can significantly relieve the symptoms of dyspepsia after ischemic stroke and promote the recovery in the patients.

A total of 36 SD rats were randomly divided into sham operation group, spinal cord injury group, and Jiaji EA group, with 12 rats in each group. The spinal cord injury model was established using Allen's method. The Jiaji EA group was treated with EA at EX-B2 (once a day, 30 min each time, for a total of 14 d). After the treatment, the Basso Beattie Bresnahan (BBB) score was used to evaluate the hindlimb motor function of rats in each group. HE staining was used to observe the morphological changes of spinal cord tissues. TUNEL staining was used to observe the pathological changes and neuronal apoptosis rate of the spinal cord. Western blot was used to detect the relative expression levels of phosphorylated (p)-JAK2, p-STAT3, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), and Caspase-3 proteins in the spinal cord. Compared with the sham operation group at the same time point, the BBB score decreased (<i>P</i><0.01), the spinal cord tissue structure in the injury area was disordered, the cell body shrank, and the neuronal apoptosis rate increased (<i>P</i><0.01), the expression levels of p-JAK2, p-STAT3, Bax, and caspase-3 proteins increased (<i>P</i><0.01) while the expression level of Bcl-2 protein decreased (<i>P</i><0.01) in rats of the spinal cord injury group. Compared with the spinal cord injury group, the BBB score increased on the 7<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> day of intervention (<i>P</i><0.01), the spinal cord tissue structure tended to be normal, the degree of neuronal damage was reduced, and the apoptosis rate decreased (<i>P</i><0.01), the expression levels of p-JAK2, p-STAT3, Bax, and caspase-3 proteins decreased (<i>P</i><0.01, <i>P</i><0.05), while the expression level of Bcl-2 protein increased (<i>P</i><0.05) in rats of the Jiaji EA group. EA at EX-B2 can improve the motor function of rats with spinal cord injury, up-regulate the expressions of anti-apoptotic factors, down-regulate the expressions of pro-apoptotic factors, and reduce neuronal apoptosis in spinal cord injury.

40551644,[Effect of acupuncture on intracerebral mitochondrial function in mice with cerebral hemorrhage].,"To observe the effect of acupuncture on the recovery of neurological function in mice with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), so as to explore its mechanism of regulating mitochondria in brain tissue of ICH mice through the utilization of RNA sequencing and m6A methylation sequencing technology. Twenty-four male C57BL/6J mice were ramondly divided into sham operation, model, and acupuncture groups (<i>n</i>=8 in each group). The ICH model was established by injection of the rat's auto-blood (10 μL) into the right caudatum region. Acupuncture group received manual acupuncture stimulation of ""Baihui"" (GV20) for 30 min, once every 12 h for 7 d. After the intervention, the behavioral scores of mice in each group were evaluated. The contents of glutathione peroxidase malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in brain tissue were detected by ELISA. The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification genes of ICH mice brain tissue were analyzed using RNA and m6A sequencing. The protein expression level of mitochondrial outer membrane translocase 20 (TOMM20) was detected by Western blot. The mRNA expression levels of Ndufb3、Ndufb6、Uqcr11、Cox7c、Ndufv1、Ndufb11 and Cytb were detected by PCR. Compared with the sham operation group, the suspension test score, balance walking test score, GSH-Px and SOD contents in the brain tissue were decreased (<i>P</i><0.01), while the MDA content in the brain tissue was increased (<i>P</i><0.01) in the model group. After the intervention and compared with the model group, the scores of the suspension test, the balance walking test and the contents of GSH-Px and SOD were increased (<i>P</i><0.01, <i>P</i><0.05), while the content of MDA was decreased (<i>P</i><0.01) in the acupuncture group. RNA sequencing showed that a total of 780 differentially expressed genes were screened in the model group compared with the sham operation group, a total of 1 097 differentially expressed genes were screened in the acupuncture group compared with the model group, and the shared differential genes in the sham group vs model group and model group vs acupuncture group were 342;and 50 common differential genes were obtained after intersection with mitochondrial-related genes. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses of the screened differentially expressed genes revealed that the above differential genes were mainly enriched in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. PCR and Western blot verification results showed that compared with the sham operation group, the expression levels of Ndufb3, Ndufb6, Uqcr11, Cox7c, Ndufv1, Ndufb11 and Cytb mRNA, and the expression level of TOMM20 protein were decreased (<i>P</i><0.01) in the model group.

A total of 84 male SD rats were used in the present study. The CIRI model was established by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and reperfusion (MCAO/R), followed by dividing the CIRI rats into model group, EA group, and edaravone group (<i>n</i>=21 in each group). And another 21 normal rats were used as the sham operation group. For rats of the EA group, EA (2 Hz/15 Hz, 1 mA) was applied to ""Baihui"" (GV20) and ""Zusanli"" (ST36) on the affected limb for 20 min, once a day for 3 days. Rats of the edaravone group were intraperitoneally injected with edaravone injection (3 mg/kg), once a day for 3 days. The modified neurological severity score (mNSS) was used to evaluate the neurological behavior of rats. TTC staining was used to detect the percentage of cerebral infarction volume. HE staining was used to observe the pathological changes of cerebral cortex in ischemic area. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the changes of BBB ultrastructure in ischemic cortex. Evans blue (EB) staining was used to evaluate BBB permeability. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the expression of HIF-1α and VEGF protein in ischemic cortex. The protein and mRNA expressions of HIF-1α, VEGF, MMP-9, Zonula Occludens 1 (ZO-1), Occludin and Claudin-5 in the ischemic cortex were detected by Western blot or real-time PCR, respectively. Compared with the sham operation group, the neurological deficit score, the percentage of cerebral infarction volume, EB leakage, the positive expressions of HIF-1α and VEGF, the protein and mRNA expressions of HIF-1α, VEGF and MMP-9 of ischemic cortex were increased (<i>P</i><0.01) in the model group , while the protein and mRNA expressions of ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin-5 were decreased (<i>P</i><0.01). After the intervention and compared with the model group, the neurological deficit score, the percentage of cerebral infarction volume, EB leakage, the positive expressions of HIF-1α and VEGF, the protein and mRNA expressions of HIF-1α, VEGF and MMP-9 of ischemic cortex were decreased (<i>P</i><0.01, <i>P</i><0.05) in the EA and edaravone groups;the protein and mRNA expression of ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin-5 were increased (<i>P</i><0.05, <i>P</i><0.01) in the EA group;the protein and mRNA expression of Occludin were increased (<i>P</i><0.01, <i>P</i><0.05) and the mRNA expression of ZO-1 and Claudin-5 were increased (<i>P</i><0.05, <i>P</i><0.01) in the edaravone group. The ultrastructure of BBB was damaged in the model group, which were relatively milder in the EA and edaravone groups.

40551629,Attachment Differences Across Close Relationships Among Inpatients With Avoidant or Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Pathology.,"Two pathologies frequently presenting to treatment are the fear-based Cluster C variants of avoidant and obsessive-compulsive personality disorders. Despite their distinctive syndromes, the literature has noted similar presentations and therapist-patient interactions that challenge diagnostic and treatment efforts. This study used a large sample (N = 1728) of psychiatric inpatients to observe differences in attachment styles across important persons (e.g., mom, dad, partner and friends) for those with avoidant or obsessive-compulsive personality pathology. Results demonstrated variety in attachment style across important persons, particularly for those with avoidant personality disorder. A discussion of these results conveys their distinction as clinical syndromes, despite their grouping under the Cluster C category. Further, clinical implications are discussed to advocate for my tailored approaches to treating these conditions in psychotherapy and inpatient practice. SUMMARY: Inpatients with avoidant personality pathology demonstrated insecure attachment across more important figures than those with obsessive-compulsive personality pathology. Both avoidant and obsessive-compulsive PD inpatients share a maternal insecure attachment. The current DSM-5 categorization may overemphasize the degree of overlap between these Cluster C conditions.",Clinical psychology & psychotherapy,2025,John T Rucker; Katrina A Rufino
40551608,Association of Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Uncontrolled Hypertension in the Middle Aged 40-59 in Korean Population.,"Emerging evidence highlights the interplay between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and resistant hypertension. Therefore, we aimed to explore the association between OSA and uncontrolled hypertension in the Korean middle-aged population. This cross-sectional study utilized data from the 2019-2020 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey participants aged 40-59. OSA was identified using the STOP-BANG questionnaire, whereas hypertension control was defined as a systolic blood pressure of < 140 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure of < 90 mmHg, with stricter criteria for those with diabetes. The sociodemographic and health-related characteristics of the participants with and without OSA were evaluated. Finally, univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were performed to investigate the association between OSA and hypertension control. Of the 4,061 patients aged 40-59, 725 (17.9%) were identified as OSA. The proportion of patients diagnosed with hypertension was significantly higher in the OSA group than in the non-OSA group (48.1% vs. 10.5%, <i>P</i> < 0.001). The prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension was significantly higher in the OSA group, both among those with diagnosed hypertension (45.5% vs. 32.6%, <i>P</i> = 0.003) and those taking antihypertensive medication (39.8% vs. 30.1%, <i>P</i> = 0.024). After adjusting for confounders, OSA (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-2.26), diabetes (aOR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.10-2.64), and male sex (aOR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.05-2.71) were significantly associated with uncontrolled hypertension in patients with hypertension aged 40-59 years despite using antihypertensive medication. This study highlights a significant association between OSA and uncontrolled hypertension in the middle-aged Korean population and emphasizes the need for routine OSA screening in patients with hypertension at this age. Integrating OSA management into hypertension treatment could improve blood pressure control and reduce cardiovascular risk.",Journal of Korean medical science,2025,Eung-Joon Lee; Seung Jae Kim

40551592,Menopausal Hormone Therapy and the Risk of Stroke: A Nationwide Cohort Study.,"Most studies have reported that the risk of coronary heart disease decreases when menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is initiated before the age of 60 years or within 10 years of menopause. However, the findings regarding stroke risk remain conflicting. This study investigated the association between the risk of ischemic stroke and MHT, categorized by the type of MHT. This population-based, retrospective cohort study was based on the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (2004-2015). Participants were aged 45-60 years with no cardiovascular disease or preexisting stroke, classified as never, past, and current users of MHT. Among the study participants, 16915 (88.77%) women had never undergone MHT, 1437 (7.54%) had previously undergone MHT, and 703 (3.69%) were currently using MHT. During the study period, with a mean follow-up of 11.23±2.13 years, the risk of ischemic events was significantly higher among current users [hazard ratio (HR): 2.98, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.95-4.57, <i>p</i><0.001], particularly in those using estrogen-only MHT (HR: 3.49, 95% CI: 1.12-10.90, <i>p</i>=0.032) and tibolone (HR: 3.52, 95% CI: 2.05-6.03, <i>p</i><0.001), compared to never users. Meanwhile, no significant difference in the risk of ischemic events was observed between past users and never users, even after analyses accounting for estrogen type and progestin co-administration. Women currently receiving MHT without underlying cardiovascular disease exhibited an increased risk of ischemic stroke, particularly those treated with E-only MHT or tibolone. However, this increased risk returned to baseline after discontinuing MHT, indicating that past use of MHT was not associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke.",Yonsei medical journal,2025,Sung Pil Choo; Hyunji Park; Hyemin Park; Inha Lee; Sihyun Cho; Changsoo Kim; Kyung-Yul Lee; Jae Hoon Lee; Jong-Youn Kim
40551591,Exploring the Relationship between Parental Stress and Child Behavioral Problems in Precocious Puberty: The Role of Parenting and Coping Strategies.,"Children with precocious puberty undergo rapid physical changes that may lead to behavioral problems. Parenting style, along with parental stress and coping mechanisms, are important parental factors that affect the development of behavioral problems in children. Therefore, we examined the serial mediating effects of parenting style and parent's coping mechanisms on the relationship between parental stress and behavioral problems in girls with precocious puberty. This cross-sectional study analyzed a convenience sample of 200 mothers of girls with precocious puberty at a university hospital located in a metropolitan area of Korea. Mothers completed The Parental Stress Measurement, Parents as Social Context Questionnaire, Coping Inventory for Stress Situations, and Korean version of the Child Behavior Checklist 6-18. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, Pearson's correlations, and bootstrap analyses were used to analyze the collected data. Parental stress from family and personal roles triggers emotion-oriented coping, which reinforces negative parenting and contributes to children's behavioral issues. Conversely, stress from relationships promotes task-focused coping, which enhances positive parenting attitudes and reduces negative ones. Interventions should be developed and applied to help mothers of children with precocious puberty use task-focused coping strategies in stressful situations to positively impact their children's behavioral problems.",Yonsei medical journal,2025,Young Il Cho; Ahreum Kwon; Hyo Jin Kim; Eun Seo Park; Junghwan Suh; Dong Hee Kim
40551588,Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-Based Therapies for Parkinson's Disease: Challenges and Potential Solutions.,"Over 20 years of research on human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-based therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD) has recently culminated in clinical trials. The first clinical report on autologous transplantation of patient-derived hPSCs showed significant motor symptom improvement, validating the therapeutic promise of this approach. However, critical challenges remain, notably the limited engraftment and survival of donor cells. Cellular stress incurred during in vitro differentiation of hPSCs into midbrain dopaminergic progenitors and neurons contributes to the reduced survival of grafted mDA neurons. Additionally, the host brain environment at the injection sites becomes hostile to transplanted cells due to needle trauma, immune rejection, and alpha-synuclein pathology present in the brains of PD patients. This review discusses potential strategies to address both intrinsic donor cell stress and hostile host brain environment, aiming to enhance the long-term efficacy and engraftment of hPSC-based cell therapies for PD.",Yonsei medical journal,2025,Mi-Yoon Chang; Sang-Hun Lee
40551587,Predictive role of weight-adjusted waist index in diabetic peripheral neuropathy among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Obesity is a known risk factor for diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), but the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and DPN remains controversial. This study explores the relationship between weight-adjusted waist index (WWI) and DPN in Chinese patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), with the goal of establishing WWI as an effective tool for the early detection and risk stratification of DPN. A total of 1790 participants were included. The relationships between WWI, BMI, WC, and DPN were analyzed using logistic regression, restricted cubic spline, and subgroup analysis, with ROC-AUC used to assess the diagnostic performance of the obesity indices. During this cross-sectional study, a total of 895 cases of DPN were recorded. Each 1-SD increase in WWI was associated with an increased risk of DPN in Model 1 (OR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.37-2.16), Model 2 (OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.10-1.80), and Model 3 (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.06-1.77). A linear relationship was observed between WWI and DPN when WWI was greater than 10.757 cm/√kg (OR: 1.375, 95% CI: 1.115-1.7). BMI was nonlinearly associated with DPN (<i>p</i>-nonlinear < 0.05), and age significantly modified the relationship between BMI and DPN. ROC analysis indicated that WWI had superior diagnostic performance compared to BMI and WC. WWI is linearly and independently associated with DPN and demonstrates greater stability and predictive value than BMI and WC. Therefore, WWI may serve as a more reliable indicator for identifying individuals at risk for DPN.",Annals of medicine,2025,Meng-Ke Cheng; Yao-Yao Guo; Zi-Yin Zhang; Xiao-Nan Kang; Dan Wang; Hui-Hui Ren; Gang Yuan
40551577,Parental and Educator Perceptions of Implementing Standardized Screenings for Early Detection of Motor Skills in Preschoolers: A Representative Survey.,"Motor skill development in early childhood is essential for children's overall growth, including social participation and academic readiness. Despite the importance of motor skills, Austria's preventive health program for preschoolers currently lacks standardized motor screenings. This study explores the perceptions of parents and kindergarten educators regarding the potential implementation of regular, standardized motor skill screenings in kindergartens across Tyrol. In April-May 2024, questionnaires were distributed to 25 kindergartens across Tyrol. Parents and educators responded to structured and open-ended questions on the perceived importance, feasibility and potential impact of mobility screenings. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively, whereas qualitative data underwent thematic analysis to identify key themes regarding attitudes and practical considerations for implementing mobility screenings. A total of 892 parents and 19 educator teams responded. Both strongly supported mobility screenings, with 90.6% of the parents viewing them as important as existing health screenings and 100% of educators valuing their importance regarding children's motor development. Qualitative responses from parents emphasized the role of mobility screenings in promoting general development while highlighting the need for a child-friendly, voluntary approach. Educators not only showed strong support, noting the feasibility and benefit of daily routines, but also identified logistical and communication challenges regarding follow-up. Both groups acknowledged the potential of standardized screenings for early identification, allowing timely developmental support. The findings underscore the perceived importance of mobility screening in kindergarten to identify motor skill deficits in early childhood, an insight strongly supported by both educators and parents. Stakeholder support is a critical prerequisite for potential policy adaptations towards offering standardized kindergarten mobility screenings. To ensure effective integration, practical factors such as logistics, tool selection and accessibility must be addressed.","Child: care, health and development",2025,Barbara Scheiber; Sarah Mildner; Peter Federolf

However, the definitive pathogenic link between OXA1L variants and mitochondrial diseases as well as the underlying pathogenesis remains elusive. In this study, we identified bi-allelic variants of c.620G>T, p.(Cys207Phe) and c.1163_1164del, p.(Val388Alafs*15) in OXA1L gene in a mitochondrial myopathy patient using whole exome sequencing. To unravel the genotype-phenotype relationship and underlying pathogenic mechanism between OXA1L variants and mitochondrial diseases, patient-specific human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) were reprogrammed and differentiated into myotubes, while OXA1L knockout human immortalised skeletal muscle cells (IHSMC) and a conditional skeletal muscle knockout mouse model was generated using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 genomic editing technology. Both patient-specific hiPSC differentiated myotubes and OXA1L knockout IHSMC showed combined mitochondrial respiratory chain defects and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) impairments. Notably, in OXA1L-knockout IHSMC, transfection of wild-type human OXA1L but not truncated mutant form rescued the respiratory chain defects. Moreover, skeletal muscle conditional Oxa1l knockout mice exhibited OXPHOS deficiencies and skeletal muscle morphofunctional abnormalities, recapitulating the phenotypes of mitochondrial myopathy. Further functional investigations revealed that impaired OXPHOS resulting of OXA1L deficiency led to elevated reactive oxygen species production, which possibly activated the nuclear factor kappa B signalling pathway, triggering cell apoptosis. Together, our findings reinforce the genotype-phenotype association between OXA1L variations and mitochondrial diseases and further delineate the potential molecular mechanisms of how OXA1L deficiency causes skeletal muscle deficits in mitochondrial myopathy. OXA1L gene bi-allelic variants cause mitochondrial myopathy. OXA1L deficiency results in combined mitochondrial respiratory chain defects and OXPHOS impairments. OXA1L deficiency leads to elevated ROS production, which may activate the NF-κB signalling pathway, disturbing myogenic gene expression and triggering cell apoptosis.",Clinical and translational medicine,2025,Yongkun Zhan; Qian Wang; Ya Wang; Yanjie Fan; Dan Yan; Xianlong Lin; Yaoting Chen; Tingting Hu; Nan Li; Weiqian Dai; Hezhi Fang; Yongguo Yu
40551554,"Multimodal Model for Non-Invasive Detection of DRD2, SSTR2 and ESR1 Receptor Profiling in Pituitary Neuroendocrine Tumors: A Retrospective Study.","<b>Introduction</b>: The dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2), somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2), and oestrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) have been demonstrated to play a critical role in determining treatment response in pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs). However, the identification of these receptors preoperative presented a significant challenge. The objective of this study was to develop a predictive model that employs both radiomics and deep learning features in conjunction with conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict the expression of these three receptors in PitNETs in a retrospective study. <b>Materials and Methods</b>: A total of 186 patients with complete imaging data (coronal T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI) were included for model construction (training set, n = 148; validation set, n = 38). Semiquantitative analysis of re-verse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry of the samples was performed to complete the classification of high or low expressions of these three drug targets in patients. A multimodal model was validated using a receiver operating characteristic analysis on an independent validation set. <b>Results</b>: The dynamic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9571 (DRD2), 0.9191 (SSTR2), and 0.9485 (ESR1) in the training set and an AUC of 0.9260 (DRD2), 0.9084 (SSTR2), and 0.9409 (ESR1) in the validation set, which fitted well with the training set. The dynamic MLP classifier achieved the highest performance among all the individual models in the validation set. <b>Conclusions</b>: The dynamic MLP classifier can noninvasively predict the expression of key targets of PitNETs, which will help guide clinical drug treatment decisions.",Technology in cancer research & treatment,2025,Jianglong Lu; Xianpeng Wang; Jinghao Jin; Fanjie Xu; Runhua Tang; Cheng Han; Zerui Wu; Zhipeng Su; Yuhang Guo
40551549,Outcome of Haemopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in 21 Patients With Alpha-Mannosidosis.,"The outcomes of alpha-mannosidosis after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are incompletely described. This retrospective multi-center study evaluated the outcomes of patients who underwent HSCT for their alpha-mannosidosis after 2010. Twenty-one children (11 females) with enzymatically and/or genetically confirmed alpha-mannosidosis, diagnosed at a mean age of 14 months (0-60 months), were included. The median age at HSCT was 3.9 years (10 months to 13.3 years) with a median follow-up of 2.3 years (0.3-14.1 years). Seventy-four percent (14/19) of patients received an unrelated graft while the rest had a matched sibling donor. Primary engraftment was reached in 17 of 21 patients; four patients required a second HSCT with successful subsequent engraftment. Nine patients had severe post-HSCT infections, five patients developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) (> = grade II), and one patient had chronic GvHD. No patient died during follow-up. Seven out of ten patients received enzyme replacement therapy both pre- and post-HSCT. Among children with clinical symptoms, improvement was documented in hepatomegaly (40% of patients before HSCT, down to 10% after), recurrent infections (62%/30%), and hearing disorder (85%/65%). In 13 patients with developmental data, outcomes after HSCT suggested at least mild delays persisted post-HSCT in the majority (85%), with some trends of higher functioning with earlier treatment. Findings suggest HSCT has shown notable improvements in safety and is associated with clinical benefit in alpha-mannosidosis. Neurodevelopmental findings require longer-term study to account for phenotypic diversity.",Journal of inherited metabolic disease,2025,Robert Šáhó; Renata Formánková; Julie B Eisengart; Allan Meldgaard Lund; Cecilie Videbaek; Berrak Bilginer Gürbüz; Namık Yaşar Özbek; Fatma Al Jasmi; Pavel Ješina; François Feillet; Cécile Pochon; Anne-Sophie Guémann; Moeenaldeen AlSayed; Sabine Laktina; Sema Kalkan Uçar; Serap Aksoylar; Troy C Lund; Paul John Orchard; Fatma Tuba Eminoğlu; Talia İleri; Çiğdem Seher Kasapkara; Akif Yeşilipek; Ali Tunç Tuncel; Ansgar Schulz; Katarína Juríčková; Anna Hlavatá; Lucia Santoro; Martin Magner
40551535,Research progress in the use of botulinum toxin type a for post-stroke spasticity rehabilitation: a narrative review.,"Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability and death worldwide. Spasticity after stroke seriously affects patients' quality of life. If this state persists for a long time, it will lead to severe joint atrophy, reduced motor coordination, and even permanent disability. Therefore, clinical research has focused on the treatment of spasticity and the recovery of motor function after stroke. The aim of this paper is to explore the use of botulinum toxin type A in the rehabilitation of spasticity after stroke and to provide a theoretical basis for optimizing rehabilitation strategies, highlighting its potential value in reducing spasticity and improving motor function. This article reviews the latest research progress on the application of BTX-A in spasticity after stroke, discusses the potential and challenges of BTX-A in reducing spasticity and improving motor function in patients with stroke. Botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) is a local muscle paralytic agent that has received extensive attention in recent years for its application in reducing muscle spasticity and promoting post-stroke rehabilitation. This article confirms that botulinum toxin type A has a significant clinical effect in treating muscle spasticity after stroke and also helps improve motor function restoration in patients. Studies have shown that botulinum toxin type A injections are effective in reducing spasticity and, when combined with rehabilitation training, can facilitate the recovery of motor function in post-stroke patients. Therefore, botulinum toxin type A has a broad application prospect in the rehabilitation of post-stroke spasticity.",Annals of medicine,2025,Qianwen Xu; Hongbo Xiao; Zongjun Zhu; Yuanyuan Guan; Ya Wang
40551529,Management of Alzheimer's Disease With Nanotechnological Interventions and Novel Therapeutics.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition marked by cognitive deterioration, β-amyloid plaque buildup, intracellular tangles, and significant neuronal loss. The increasing prevalence of AD, along with its substantial economic burden, underscores the urgent need for effective therapeutic strategies in the near future. The challenge is early diagnosis and management, hindered by the lack of reliable biomarkers. Currently, there is no definitive cure for AD. Attaining improved therapeutic outcomes necessitates delivering optimal drug concentrations to the central nervous system (CNS) by effectively penetrating the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Recently, nanotechnology has emerged as a promising approach to address this challenge, enhancing brain-targeted drug delivery while highlighting recent advancements and future potential. Additionally, novel targeted therapies such as genetic therapeutics, stem cell therapy, and immunotherapy approaches overcome AD-based challenges, enhance treatment efficacy, and improve patient compliance. This review highlights recent advancements in the treatment of AD, focusing on nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems, and also explores genetic therapeutics, stem cell therapy, and immunotherapy approaches. Overall, the review provides a comprehensive overview of these therapeutic approaches, shedding light on the evolving landscape of AD treatment and the challenges that lie ahead.",Drug development research,2025,Mohd Shahrukh; Shadaan Ahmad; Mohammed Zaafar; Nazeer Hasan; Farhan Jalees Ahmad
40551523,Fargesin Exerts Neuroprotective Effect Against Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in Rats via Alteration of NF-κB Signaling Pathway.,"Neuro-inflammation is an important contributor in neurological disorders. Increased levels of cytokines and inflammatory markers are observed during brain damage. Fargesin is a naturally occurring compound classified as a lignan, a type of polyphenol frequently found in plants. It is particularly notable for its abundance in certain medicinal plants, such as Magnolia species, which are extensively used in traditional Asian medicine. Fargesis possess the potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect. We aim to investigate the inflammatory pathway-mediated neuroprotective effect of fargesin against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats. Different doses of fargesin were administered to the rats before they performed 2 h of right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) using the intraluminal filament technique, followed by 22 h of reperfusion. Neurological score, brain edema, brain water content, evans blue leakage, sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>)/calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)/potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) ATPase, antioxidant, cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and inflammatory parameters were estimated. Treatment with fargesin significantly (p < 0.001) suppressed the neurological parameters alongwith reduction of brain water content, brain edema, evans blue leakage and infract volume. Fargesin treatment remarkably (p < 0.001) suppressed the level of malonaldehyde (MDA) and boosted the level of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) along with alteration of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IL-10. Fargesin treatment significantly (p < 0.001) suppressed the level of inflammatory parameters inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin (PGE<sub>2</sub>), Nuclear factor kappa factor (NF-κB), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and MMP level such as MMP-2, MMP-3 and MMP-9 level. Fargesin treatment remarkably suppressed the mRNA expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), syndecan, colony-stimulating factor (CSF), aquaporin-1, REX1 and organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3). Fargesin demonstrated a brain protective effect against cerebral ischemia reperfusion through a lowering of inflammatory markers.",Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,2025,Ming Qiao; Yan Peng; Ting Yan; Jie Liu; JingFang Yue; Qing Zhu; XueGang Peng; ShuangXia Xiong; Gang Wen
40551458,"Utility, Costs and Cost-Utility of Amyloid-PET in the Diagnostic Process of Memory Clinic Patients: A Trial-Based Economic Evaluation From AMYPAD-DPMS.","Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) is instrumental in achieving an accurate diagnosis and may help to limit health-seeking behavior. Currently, amyloid-PET is not routinely used in clinical practice due to lack of evidence on cost-utility. We assessed the cost-utility of early versus no amyloid-PET in the diagnostic work-up of memory clinic patients after 6 months. We assessed cost-utility of patients enrolled in AMYPAD-DPMS (EudraCT Number: 2017-002527-21) from six European memory clinics and randomized in ARM1; early amyloid-PET, ARM2; no amyloid-PET or ARM3; (amyloid-PET at request of the managing physician). ARM3 was not part of the cost-utility analysis. The EuroQol classification system (EQ-5D-5L), visual analogue scale (VAS), and ICEpop Capability measure for older people (ICECAP-O) were collected at baseline and 6 months. Costs were calculated from cost diaries at baseline, 3 and 6 months. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated using EQ-5D-5L and a societal perspective. From April 2018, to October 2020, 844 participants were screened and 840 were randomized (290 ARM1; 270 ARM2 and 280 ARM3). N = 514 (250 ARM1; 264 ARM2) were included in the economic evaluation. Amyloid-PET resulted in higher costs at 6 months (ARM1 vs. ARM2 ∆€1384, bootstrapped 95% CI [7, 2761]). No significant difference in EQ-5D-5L, VAS or ICECAP-O was found. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was €461,333 per QALY. Although patients receive an early etiological diagnosis, the cost-utility after 6 months is not favorable for amyloid-PET. The cost-utility will need to be reassessed when considering amyloid-PET to select patients for anti-amyloid biologics.",European journal of neurology,2025,Ingrid S van Maurik; Daniele Altomare; Lyduine E Collij; Camilia Caprioglio; Christian Moro; Valentina Garibotto; Jean-François Demonet; Philip Scheltens; Gill Farrer; Rosella Gismondi; Andrew W Stephens; Jean Domingo Gispert; José Luis Molinuevo; Oriol Grau-Rivera; Paul Edison; Zuzana Walker; Frank Jessen; Alexander Dzrezga; Philip Zeyen; Pierre Payoux; Laure Saint-Aubert; Julien Delrieu; Agneta Nordberg; Frederik Barkhof; Giovanni B Frisoni; Johannes Berkhof
40551442,Clinical Features and Outcomes of Acute Intermittent Porphyria Presenting With Acute Quadriparesis: A Case Series and Follow-Up Study.,"A retrospective case series of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) presenting with acute quadriparesis is described with a focus on patterns of neuropathy and nerve conduction study findings. Six patients with acute polyneuropathy were diagnosed with AIP on the basis of characteristic clinical findings, urine porphobilinogen levels, and pathogenic variants in the hydroxymethylbilane synthase gene. Vital function impairment, neuropathic patterns, serial changes in nerve conduction studies (NCS), and laboratory findings are reviewed. A total of six patients with acute porphyric neuropathy were included. Patterns of weakness varied between upper and lower extremities. Three patients exhibited allodynia with preservation of large fiber sensory modalities in the acute polyneuropathy phase. Initial NCS revealed motor axonal polyneuropathy in four patients with sparing of motor conduction velocities and latencies. Relative sparing of tibial compound muscle action potential amplitudes is seen in two patients. Serial NCS revealed interval reduction of compound muscle action potential amplitudes in the upper extremity only in one patient and selective reduction of sensory nerve action potential amplitudes of the lower extremity in another patient. There were substantial delays in diagnoses, with all but one patient misdiagnosed as GBS. All but two patients required ambulation aids at last follow-up assessment. The findings in this series show variability in neuropathic patterns and NCS changes over time in AIP presenting with acute polyneuropathy. Small fiber neuropathy and allodynia with sparing of large fiber sensory modalities may serve as a diagnostic clue guiding early recognition of AIP in patients presenting with acute polyneuropathy.",European journal of neurology,2025,Reem M Alhammad; Rema A Almutawa; Abdulrahman S Ali; Nuha M Alkhawajah; Hana M Albulaihe; Afag M Osman; Mohammed A AlSheef; Alaa A Alsayed; Raashda A Sulaiman; Khalid J Alharbi
40551420,Postoperative Dysphagia Management in Hemifacial Spasm: A Case Report of Combined Catheter Balloon and Neuromuscular Stimulation.,"BACKGROUND Hemifacial spasm is a frequently encountered cranial nerve disorder caused by vascular compression, and microvascular decompression is considered the criterion standard treatment, particularly for cases resistant to pharmacological or botulinum toxin therapy. Although microvascular decompression is generally safe, it carries the risk of cranial nerve complications. Glossopharyngeal and vagus nerve dysfunction can result in cricopharyngeal dysfunction, leading to significant postoperative dysphagia characterized by poor upper esophageal sphincter (UES) opening, aspiration, and pharyngeal residue. Early and effective rehabilitation is critical but rarely documented in such cases. CASE REPORT We present a case of a 58-year-old man who developed severe dysphagia following microvascular decompression for left-sided hemifacial spasm. Postoperative videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) confirmed cricopharyngeal dysfunction, showing delayed hyoid elevation and restricted UES opening. A comprehensive rehabilitation protocol was initiated, combining neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) with balloon-guided volitional swallowing training (CBD). NMES targeted submental and laryngeal regions to facilitate muscle activation and enhance sensory feedback. CBD involved repeated, guided swallowing with balloon catheter assistance to promote UES opening. After 2 weeks of daily therapy, VFSS showed significant improvement in UES relaxation and pharyngeal clearance. The patient transitioned from nasogastric feeding to full oral intake, with a functional oral intake scale score of 6. CONCLUSIONS Cricopharyngeal dysfunction is a rare but disabling complication following microvascular decompression. This case demonstrates that early, combined rehabilitative approaches - especially integration of NMES and volitional CBD - can lead to meaningful recovery of swallowing function and better patient outcomes.",The American journal of case reports,2025,Qian Zhang; Shuang Wu; Yangmei Shi; Qian Chen; Jiajie Gao
40551418,Communication-related quality of life in adults with acquired neurological disorders who use augmentative and alternative communication: a scoping review of existing tools.,"Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) has potential to significantly enhance the QoL for those with severe communication impairment as a consequence of acquired neurological disorders. Whilst there has been a progress in the research on AAC for individuals with acquired neurological disorders and effects on QoL, there are still unanswered questions that need further investigation, specifically in the area of communication-related quality of life (CRQoL). The purpose of this scoping review is to explore tools to evaluate CRQoL in adults with acquired neurological disorders who use AAC. It examines areas of communication these tools are focused on and methods of access for individuals with acquired communication disorders who might also experience physical, cognitive, and linguistic impairment. Six databases were searched with predetermined search terms. Results indicated that 10 papers used assessment tools related to CRQoL. Gaps in the research included limited data on how communication partners were involved in assessment. Overall, findings indicate a lack of information about how AAC users can access assessment tools with adaptations or communication partner support. Future research should focus on CRQoL tools and access methods for AAC users.","Augmentative and alternative communication (Baltimore, Md. : 1985)",2025,Stavroulla Grigoriou; Mimi LaValley; Erasmia Kola; Rajinder Koul; Eliada Pampoulou
40551293,Clinical use and reporting of neurofilament quantification in neurological disorders: A global overview.,"Neurofilament light chain (NfL) quantification aids in diagnosing and predicting neurological disorders, but clinical and laboratory practices vary across centers. Differences in result interpretation and reporting further challenge test commutability. This study aimed to review the global analytical and post-analytical methods used for NfL measurement in routine clinical practice across different contexts. We established an international working group (WG) and distributed a survey to its members to gather information on context of use (COU), (pre) analytical methods, cutoff usage, as well as the interpretation and reporting of NfL measurements. Among the centers, 63% measured NfL in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 87% in blood, and 53% in both. COU was widespread, with 50% defining pathological cutoffs based on publications and 42% considering age. Reporting was primarily done through numeric results (95%). Harmonizing cutoffs, reporting, and interpretation across various clinical contexts will facilitate the incorporation of this biomarker into routine clinical practice.

40551292,Brain tissue electrical conductivity as a promising biomarker for dementia assessment using MRI.,"Dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease, involves cognitive decline linked to amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau protein aggregation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based brain tissue conductivity, which increases in dementia, may serve as a non-invasive biomarker for protein aggregation. We investigate the relationship between MRI-based brain electrical conductivity, protein aggregation, cognition, and gene expression. Brain conductivity maps were reconstructed and correlated with PET protein signals, cognitive performance, and plasma protein levels. The diagnostic potential of conductivity for dementia was assessed, and transcriptomic analysis using the Allen Human Brain Atlas elucidated the underlying biological processes. Increased brain conductivity was associated with Aβ and tau aggregation in specific brain regions, cognitive decline, and plasma protein levels. Conductivity also improved dementia discrimination performance, and higher gene expression related to ion transport, cellular development, and signaling pathways was observed. Brain electrical conductivity shows promise as a biomarker for dementia, correlating with protein aggregation and relevant cellular processes. Brain tissue conductivity correlates with Aβ and tau aggregation in dementia. Brain tissue conductivity correlates with cognitive scores and GMV. CSF conductivity correlates with plasma protein levels. Combining conductivity with GMV improves dementia diagnosis accuracy.

40551290,TMEM59 deficiency activates chaperone-mediated autophagy and ameliorates disease-like pathologies in tauopathy model mice.,"Tauopathy is characterized by the pathology of tau deposits in the brain. Transmembrane protein 59 (TMEM59) is correlated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of tauopathy. However, whether and how TMEM59 regulates tau pathology remains unknown. We analyzed TMEM59 levels in the brains of AD patients and the tau<sup>P301S</sup> transgenic (PS19) mice, evaluated behaviors and tauopathy-related pathologies in PS19 mice with TMEM59 haploinsufficiency, and studied the regulation of TMEM59 on chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) using biochemical analysis. TMEM59 levels increased in the brains of AD patients and PS19 mice at pathological stages. TMEM59 haploinsufficiency attenuated cognitive deficits and disease-related pathologies in PS19 mice. TMEM59 deficiency promoted lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A levels and CMA activity, whereas TMEM59 overexpression had the opposite effects. Our study identifies an important role of TMEM59 in regulating CMA and reveals the potential of targeting TMEM59 for tauopathy intervention. Transmembrane protein 59 (TMEM59) levels increase in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients and the tau<sup>P301S</sup> transgenic (PS19) tauopathy model mice at pathological stages. TMEM59 haploinsufficiency attenuates cognitive deficits, neurodegeneration, synapse dysfunction, gliosis, neuroinflammation, and tau pathology in PS19 mice.

40551285,"Diagnostic performance of plasma Aβ42/40 ratio, p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL along the continuum of Alzheimer's disease and non-AD dementias: An international multi-center study.","Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NfL), and amyloid beta ratio (Aβ42/40) may have diagnostic and prognostic value in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we assess which markers can best identify AD from controls and other non-AD dementias in a large international multi-center study. Plasma samples (n = 1298) were collected from six international centers. Aβ40, Aβ42, GFAP, NfL, and p-tau181 were measured using single molecule array. In each group, AD diagnosis/co-pathology was defined according to cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers or amyloid positron emission tomography. Validations were performed in three separate cohorts via single and dual cut-off models. p-tau181 showed the best area under the curve value to separate AD from frontotemporal dementia, controls, and Aβ- dementia with Lewy bodies. However, this discriminative power could not be reproduced by applying pre-defined cut-offs. p-tau181 was the best single plasma marker for detecting AD at any stage. Specific cut-offs are needed to maximize diagnostic performances. Phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181 provided a clear differentiation between controls and Alzheimer's disease (AD) participants, with evidence of increased levels in the preclinical stage of AD. Plasma biomarkers demonstrated that when amyloid co-pathology is removed from dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), only glial fibrillary acidic protein and neurofilament light chain remain to predict DLB. Given the low prevalence of amyloid co-pathology in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), p-tau181 and its ratio with amyloid beta 42 are strong biomarkers to differentiate FTD from AD.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,2025,James D Doecke; Giovanni Bellomo; Lisa Vermunt; Daniel Alcolea; Steffen Halbgebauer; Sjors In 't Veld; Niklas Mattsson-Carlgren; Katerina Veverova; Christopher J Fowler; Lynn Boonkamp; Isabel M Houtkamp; Marleen Koel-Simmerlink; Inge M W Verberk; Lorenzo Gaetani; Andrea Toja; Anna Lidia Wojdała; Juan Fortea; Yolande Pijnenburg; Afina Lemstra; Wiesje van der Flier; Jakub Hort; Markus Otto; Oskar Hansson; Lucilla Parnetti; Colin L Masters; Alberto Lleó; Armand González-Escalante; José Contador; Marc Suárez-Calvet; Aida Fernández-Lebrero; Albert Puig-Pijoan; Paula Ortiz-Romero; Esther Jiménez-Moyano; Carolina Minguillón; Marta Del Campo; Charlotte Teunissen
40551284,Comparative study on school-based mental health literacy in three Asian countries.,"Mental health literacy is essential for the recognition, management, and prevention of mental disorders among school-aged children. However, few studies have examined the implementation status of school-based mental health literacy in Asian countries. This study aims to compare the approaches taken by the Philippines, Indonesia, and Japan in managing school-based mental health literacy through curriculum-related policies. The collected documents of this study analyzed both policies (formulated from 2000 to 2023) and curricula (from grade 1 to grade 12) that were adapted to the deductive content analysis methods. Policies were analyzed using the policy triangle framework (Walt and Gilson in Health Policy Plan 9:353-370, 1994) and mapped using the review points (Margaretha et al. in Front Psychiatry 14:1126767, 2023). Curricula were analyzed using the definition of mental health literacy (Jorm in Am Psychol 67:231-243, 2012). This study focused on mental health laws and policies in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Japan, highlighting their success in addressing the needs of adults and school-aged children. By considering each country's unique socio-cultural contexts and basic educational approaches, this study identified diverse strategies and methodologies in addressing mental health challenges. Using a common analytic framework, this study collected and analyzed policies and curricula on mental health literacy from the three countries (Philippines, 22; Indonesia, 9; and Japan, 6). The basic education curricula developed by their respective Ministries of Education were used. This study highlights two key findings on school-based mental health literacy. First, mental health literacy is incorporated into health and physical education in Japan, health, values education and homeroom guidance in the Philippines, and religious education in Indonesia. Second, while the Philippines and Indonesia implement mental health education based on established policies, Japan lacks a core mental health literacy policy but has developed and implemented related curricula through its course of study guidelines. The curriculum analysis identified a specific challenge: a lack of ""first aid skills to support others who are developing a mental disorder or are in a mental health crisis"". This study revealed the partial implementation of mental health literacy education in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Japan. The Philippines offers a nearly comprehensive curriculum on mental health literacy (grades 1-12), Japan incorporates it into health education (grades 5-10), and Indonesia integrates it into religious education (grades 1-12). While the Philippines and Indonesia align with mental health policies, Japan relies on its national curriculum without a core policy. A key challenge was indicated involving teachers, guidance counselors, or school health personnel as key actors to support students with mental disorders or those potentially at risk, as well as to handle emergency cases of mental disorders in schools. Recommendations include systematic monitoring of the implementation of school-based mental health policies, collaboration with UN agencies to align with international standards while incorporating culturally tailored strategies for each country.",Tropical medicine and health,2025,Fumiko Shibuya; Masahide Usami; Marian Danille Santillan; Cut Warnaini; Ernesto Gregorio; Naoko Satake; Crystal Amiel Estrada; Gunawan Gunawan; Norieta Balderrama; Japhet Fernandez de Leon; Joie Fe Ancheta; Hamsu Kadriyan; Fernando Garcia; Jun Kobayashi
40551270,Distal electrical stimulation enhances neuromuscular reinnervation and satellite cell differentiation for functional recovery.,"Peripheral nerve injuries lead to significant motor deficits, with limited treatment options for full functional recovery. Distal electrical stimulation (E-stim) has shown promise in promoting neuromuscular reinnervation, though its mechanisms are not yet fully understood. This study aims to investigate the regulatory effects of distal E-stim on neuromuscular junction (NMJ) reinnervation and Satellite cell activity in denervated muscle injury. Using a sciatic nerve critical gap model in Sprague-Dawley rats (8-week-old, random sex), we applied distal E-stim and assessed neuromuscular and functional recovery through histological, biochemical, and functional evaluations over six weeks. The Sciatic Function Index (SFI) was measured at baseline and at subsequent time points post-injury. We quantified muscle mass, NMJ morphology, and neurotransmitter levels (acetylcholine and acetylcholinesterase), and analyzed muscle fiber electrophysiology using single-muscle electromyography to assess denervated muscle autoelectricity. Additionally, single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to examine gene expression in Satellite cells. Distal E-stim significantly enhanced neuromuscular reinnervation, as evidenced by improved SFI scores, increased muscle mass, and reduced muscle atrophy. Histological analysis showed larger muscle fiber cross-sectional areas and enhanced NMJ structure. Elevated levels of acetylcholine and acetylcholinesterase, along with reduced fibrillation potentials in muscle fibers, further indicated preserved NMJ function. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed upregulation of genes associated with muscle differentiation and angiogenesis in Satellite cell clusters, suggesting that distal E-stim fosters a regenerative environment. Our findings demonstrate that distal E-stim promotes functional recovery through NMJ preservation and Satellite cell differentiation, offering novel insights into molecular mechanisms that may enhance electroceutical therapies for peripheral nerve injuries. Further research could optimize E-stim protocols to maximize clinical benefits for patients with neuromuscular impairments.",Stem cell research & therapy,2025,Chun-Wei Lin; Szu-Han Chen; Siao Muk Cheng; Tzu-Chun Chung; Wentai Liu; Daw-Yang Hwang; Song Li; Sheng-Che Lin; Yuan-Yu Hsueh
40551252,"Abnormal α-synuclein binds to synaptotagmin 13, impairing extracellular vesicle release in synucleinopathies.","Despite increasing in vitro research, direct evidence of how abnormal α-synuclein (α-Syn) dysregulates vesicular transport and synaptic function in the human brain is lacking. We performed a transcriptome analysis using brain tissues from a multiple system atrophy (MSA) mouse model, which develops human α-Syn-positive glial cytoplasmic inclusion-like structures and neuronal cytoplasmic inclusion-like structures after tamoxifen injection. We then performed histologic and biochemical analyses using brain samples from 71 human cases (Parkinson's disease, n = 10; dementia with Lewy bodies [DLB], n = 19; MSA, n = 15; control: n = 27), a human blood sample (control: n = 1), and cultured cells. Based on the transcriptome of the MSA mouse model, we identified 10 vesicular transport proteins, including synaptotagmin 13 (SYT13), that might interact with α-Syn. Immunohistochemistry using human brain samples demonstrated that of the 10 vesicular transport proteins identified in the transcriptome analysis, only SYT13 was incorporated into both Lewy bodies and glial cytoplasmic inclusions. Proximity ligation assays revealed that SYT13 exhibited a higher degree of interactions with phosphorylated α-Syn than with endogenous α-Syn. Immunoprecipitation confirmed that SYT13 bound predominantly to phosphorylated α-Syn, SYT1, and the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes. Filter trap assays revealed interactions between SYT13 and soluble toxic β-sheet-rich α-Syn oligomers. Furthermore, fraction analysis showed a significant increase of SYT13 protein levels at the synapses in DLB and MSA. Notably, a correlation was observed between the levels of SYT13 and aggregated α-Syn at the synapses. SYT13 was observed to regulate extracellular vesicle release in association with SYT1 and the SNARE complexes in SH-SY5Y cells. SYT13 overexpression in SH-SY5Y cells impaired extracellular vesicle release. Consistently, the numbers of extracellular vesicles were significantly reduced in the brain homogenates of DLB and MSA cases compared with those in controls. Abnormal α-Syn impairs extracellular vesicle release through interactions with SYT13 in synucleinopathies. Our findings provide insights into therapeutic strategies for alleviating dysregulations of vesicular transport and synaptic function in patients with synucleinopathies.",Translational neurodegeneration,2025,Yasuo Miki; Shuji Shimoyama; Makoto T Tanaka; Hanae Kushibiki; Asa Nakahara; Xiaopeng Wen; Masanori Hijioka; Tomoya Kon; Megha Murthy; Tomonori Furukawa; Conceição Bettencourt; Fumiaki Mori; Hiroki Mizukami; Shirushi Takahashi; Mari Tada; Yoshihisa Kitamura; Akiyoshi Kakita; Thomas T Warner; Koichi Wakabayashi
40551205,Mechanisms of interventions targeting modifiable factors for dementia risk reduction.,"The global prevalence of dementia is increasing. With no widely available and accessible treatments to halt or reverse the progression of dementia, exploring preventative strategies is critical. Lifestyle-based interventions show promise in preventing or delaying dementia onset. However, understanding the complex and multifactorial mechanisms underlying dementia, and how interventions target these pathways, is essential for developing personalized and effective strategies. In this review, we examined the current evidence of the mediating pathways in dementia risk reduction. We focused on mechanisms investigated in single-domain interventions on physical exercise, cognitive training, diet, metabolic/cardiovascular or psycho-social risk factors in line with those combined in the landmark FINGER trial. Additionally, we synthesized existing literature on mechanisms of action in multimodal interventions combining multiple lifestyle changes. Most evidence was identified in relation to neuroimaging biomarkers with positive effects for all intervention components. The evidence among fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) (amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ), tau and neurofilament light chain (Nfl)) vascular markers, inflammatory markers, and neurotrophins were less conclusive, though physical exercise consistently appeared to impact several of these pathways. The findings of this review underscore the potential of lifestyle-based interventions in modulating several different types of pathophysiological pathways associated with dementia. As the number of dementia cases reach epidemic proportions, a multifaceted approach is needed. We propose that the next critical step in dementia prevention/risk reduction is to refine existing intervention tools and develop an adaptive platform that integrates different lifestyle interventions tailored to individual risk profiles and needs. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and biomarkers related to modifiable risk factors will be instrumental to optimising these interventions.",Molecular neurodegeneration,2025,Anna Matton; Ruth Stephen; Makrina Daniilidou; Mariagnese Barbera; Vilma Alanko; Marcel Ballin; Jamie Ford; Katri Hemiö; Jenni Lehtisalo; Sabsil López Rocha; Francesca Mangialasche; Tiia Ngandu; Anna Rosenberg; Gazi Saadmaan; Chinedu Udeh-Momoh; Kerttu Uusimäki; Alina Solomon; Miia Kivipelto
40551190,Early acetaminophen use is associated with the reduced mortality risk in patients with sepsis-associated encephalopathy: a retrospective study.,"Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE), a severe neurological complication of systemic infection, carries substantial morbidity and mortality risks. This study aims to examine the relationship between early acetaminophen use and survival rates in critically ill SAE patients. Using data from the MIMIC-IV database, we conducted a retrospective cohort study on patients with SAE, stratified by acetaminophen exposure within 48 h of ICU admission. Among the 4111 eligible patients (1689 acetaminophen recipients versus 2422 non-recipients), propensity score matching resulted in 3124 matched subjects (1562 per cohort). The primary outcome was 90-day mortality, while secondary outcomes included mortality rates at 30, 60, 180, and 365 days. Survival analyses utilized Cox proportional hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier curves, supplemented by subgroup analyses for 90-day mortality. Acetaminophen exposure was correlated with reduced 30-day mortality rate (HR = 0.78, 95%CI [0.65-0.94], p < 0.05), as well as decreased 60-day (HR = 0.71, 95%CI [0.60-0.83], p < 0.001), 90-day (HR = 0.70, 95%CI [0.60-0.81], p < 0.001), 180-day (HR = 0.70, 95%CI [0.60-0.80], p < 0.001) and 365-day (HR = 0.69, 95%CI [0.61-0.79], p < 0.001) mortality rate after PSM. The Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated significantly higher survival rates in the acetaminophen group compared to the non-acetaminophen group, with a persistent trend at 30, 90, 180, and 365 days (log-rank p < 0.05). The protective effect was consistent across subgroups except acetaminophen dosage ≥ 650 mg. Early administration of acetaminophen is associated with reduced short- and long-term mortality in SAE patients. These findings support a potential therapeutic role for acetaminophen in SAE and warrant further mechanistic and prospective validation.",European journal of medical research,2025,Fengzhen Huang; Jiping Yi; Tieqiao Zhou; Xiaoxiang Gong
40551181,Insidious meningitis induced by brucellosis: a case report.,"Brucellosis is a rare etiology for chronic neurological infections, posing a diagnostic challenge for patients due to the potential for atypical symptoms. We are presenting a rare case report of Brucella meningitis. A 25-year-old unmarried Syrian female without any prior medical history presented with a progressive headache that had persisted for over 10 months, accompanied by nausea and vomiting that worsened when lying down. Initially, the diagnosis was attributed to idiopathic intracrainal hypertension due to the absence of systemic symptoms and an incorrect cerebrospinal fluid test. A comprehensive re-evaluation was performed, and Wright test was positive and Brucella antibodies were detected in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples. This ultimately confirmed the diagnosis of Brucella meningitis. Our report emphasizes the importance of considering atypical bacteria as a cause for neuro-infection, and a wide investigation should be conducted to reach an accurate diagnosis and reevaluation of tests when necessary.",Journal of medical case reports,2025,Raghad Mahmoud Alsuliman; Heba Haj Saleh; Huda Hossin; Ibrahim Labbad
40551168,Delivery of LOXL1-AS1-siRNAs using targeting peptide-engineered extracellular vesicles with focused ultrasound to suppress medulloblastoma metastasis.,"Metastasis of medulloblastomas (MBs) is difficult to treat and remains the primary cause of death in children with this brain tumor. Current treatment focuses on radiotherapy to limit metastatic recurrence and maintain survival, but this may cause long-term neurocognitive deficits. This challenge emphasizes the need for novel targeted therapies to combat metastatic MB. In this study, we report an RNA therapy model using targeted extracellular vesicles (EVs) to deliver therapeutic small-interfering (si)RNAs to MB. First, MB-targeted EVs (MB-tEVs) were generated via genetic modification of EV-producing cells to express E1-3, an MB-specific peptide. Next, isolated MB-tEVs were loaded with siRNAs that targeted LOXL1-AS1, a pro-metastatic long non-coding RNA in sonic-hedgehog MB (SHH-MB). Expression of the E1-3 peptide increased MB-tEV internalization into MB cells, where the delivered siRNAs effectively silenced LOXL1-AS1 and suppressed LOXL1-AS1-mediated metastatic traits of SHH-MB cells in vitro. Locoregional application of microbubble-enhanced focused ultrasound (FUS) improved the accumulation of systemically injected EVs in the mouse brain. Mice treated with siRNA-loaded MB-tEVs had decreased LOXL1-AS1 expression, reduced metastases, and improved survival in an SHH-MB orthotopic model. Our study provides the first and very promising evidence for the combined use of tumor-targeted EVs and microbubble-enhanced FUS to deliver therapeutic siRNAs to suppress metastatic MB, potentially supporting conventional treatments and improving clinical outcomes of this malignant pediatric tumor.",Journal of nanobiotechnology,2025,Anh Duy Do; Shing-Shung Chu; Le Hien Giang; Pei-Lin Huang; Yu-Ling Lin; Che-Chang Chang; Tai-Tong Wong; Shian-Ying Sung; Chia-Ling Hsieh
40551167,Photobiomodulation mitigates blood-brain barrier disruption in APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease by activating the AMPK pathway.,"Photobiomodulation (PBM), which utilizes specific light wavelengths to regulate cellular metabolism, signal transduction, and gene expression, has emerged as a promising intervention for enhancing cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a critical role in protecting the central nervous system, and its dysfunction is a major contributor to AD pathogenesis. Although PBM has shown therapeutic potential, its effects on BBB integrity and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Six-month-old female APP/PS1 transgenic mice were subjected to PBM intervention (808 nm, 20 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) for six weeks. Cognitive function was assessed using behavioral tests, while biochemical and histological analyses were conducted to evaluate BBB integrity, β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, and protein expression related to tight junction proteins (TJs). In vitro, an inflammatory model was established by treating brain microvascular endothelial cells (bEnd.3) with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce an inflammatory response, and the mechanisms of PBM were further explored by analyzing mitochondrial function. PBM significantly improved cognitive deficits and anxiety-like behaviors in AD mice. It enhanced BBB integrity by upregulating the TJs Occludin, Claudin-5, and ZO-1, while also facilitating Aβ clearance via the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) pathway and microglial phagocytosis, thereby reducing Aβ accumulation in the brain. Mechanistically, PBM attenuated apoptosis and mitochondrial oxidative stress while promoting mitochondrial energy metabolism. Notably, PBM markedly increased phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK) levels in the brains of AD mice. In vitro, the protective effects of PBM on BBB integrity were substantially diminished upon AMPK inhibition, confirming that PBM exerts its neuroprotective effects through the activation of the AMPK pathway. This study demonstrates that PBM enhances BBB integrity and mitigates Aβ pathology in AD mice by activating the AMPK signaling pathway, underscoring its potential as a novel, non-invasive therapeutic strategy for AD.",Alzheimer's research & therapy,2025,Chunyan Ma; Yutong Ye; Xinyu Shi; Na Li; Zhiming Mu; Tao Tan; Huijuan Yin; Jianwu Dai; Yi Liu; Hongli Chen
40551158,Long-term electroacupuncture and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation differentially slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease in App<sup>NL-G-F</sup> mice.,"Both electroacupuncture (EA) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) possess the potential in combating the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we compared the effects of the two regimens as early long-term intervention in App<sup>NL-G-F</sup> mice, a new amyloid precursor protein (APP) knock-in model that recapitulates multiple AD-associated pathologies, including amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, microgliosis, astrocytosis, dendritic and synaptic degeneration. The 2-month-old freely moving model mice randomly received EA or rTMS for 2~3 sessions a week for 6 months. Cognitive tests were conducted in Y maze and Barnes maze sequentially at the age of 4, 6, and 8 months. The cortex and hippocampus were dissected thereafter for neurohistological and molecular analysis. Both regimens markedly prevented cognitive deterioration at 6 months old. EA maintained its significant prevention to 8 months old, but rTMS did not. At this age, EA remarkably reduced Aβ burdens with particular dense-core plaques; rTMS had similar effects on Aβ plaques, but not on dense-core plaques. Both regimens displayed greater suppression on microgliosis in the cortex than in the hippocampus, and equivalently inhibited astrocytosis in the two brain regions. While both EA and rTMS protected against dendritic degeneration surrounding Aβ plaques, EA further mitigated synaptic loss. These results demonstrated that EA produced more long-lasting and broad-acting effects than rTMS in alleviating memory impairment and pathological products of AD. EA could serve as an early long-term intervention and rTMS as adjuvant therapy in slowing the progression of AD.",Alzheimer's research & therapy,2025,Si-Min Song; Qian-Min Liu; Xi Huang; Ping Chen; Min Tao; Xia Pei; Hua-Ning Wang; Yan Han; Jian-Guo Chen; Wei Hong; Zhang-Jin Zhang
40551150,Harm reduction in photovoice knowledge mobilization with 2S/LGBTQ+ youth who use(d) drugs: A community showcase.,"Photovoice, a participatory photography approach, is an action-oriented research methodology that is increasingly being taken up in research with equity-owed populations and related to sensitive topics. This includes scholarship and activism with people who use(d) drugs, for which there are important ethical and pragmatic considerations. Among these is the challenge of drawing attention to substance use-related inequities yet not causing harm in (mis)representing communities, above all when sharing participant-produced photography with wider public audiences, including via photovoice exhibits. In this commentary, we draw from our recent photovoice research with 2S/LGBTQ+ youth who use(d) drugs to recount our process of planning and hosting a community photovoice exhibit, with the aim of highlighting implications for harm reduction-oriented and youth-engaged knowledge mobilization. We begin by introducing our Youth Action Committee, comprised of nine transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming youth who use(d) drugs, while briefly tracing our group's history of collaboration leading up the 'Queer Eyes, Queer Lives' photovoice exhibit, with Vancouver's 2024 Queer Arts Festival. Next, we discuss our participatory and intentional approach to planning this community event, including the steps we took to increase accessibility and turnout (e.g., venue selection, strategic partnerships) and make the exhibit youth-friendly and engaging (e.g., hiring a DJ, providing food, enlisting Youth Action Committee members as speakers). We then detail our approach to promoting youth choice in selecting generative and non-harmful photographs for the exhibit, such as by using photo-rating and photo-release processes during study data collection and deliberating with the Youth Action Committee to choose exhibit photographs that could most appropriately and respectfully represent research participant's multiple lived realities. We couch this practical discussion within a broader conversation about resisting damage- and deficit-focused narratives in substance use research, highlighting our group's active efforts to shift such narratives by showcasing photography reflecting community resiliencies, strengths, joys, and politicalities. The parts and sum of this commentary provide direction for other activist-scholars seeking to create, share, and mobilize art in substance use research and community intervention, and we end the paper by encouraging others to reinterpret and build on our approach through their own work.",Harm reduction journal,2025,Trevor Goodyear; Christian Barborini; Reid Gilmore; Apollo Collin-Gray; Mazal Jensen; Lee Young; Alec Hossain; En He
40551140,"The PKCι-β-arrestin2 axis disrupts SORLA retrograde trafficking, driving its degradation and amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease.","Variants of SORL1 have been associated with both late and early onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). SORL1 encodes the sorting-related receptor with A repeat (SORLA) protein, which belongs to the VPS10 receptor family. SORLA protects against AD pathogenesis through its sorting function, and reduced SORLA levels have been consistently observed in sporadic AD. Although the importance of SORLA in AD pathogenesis is well recognized, how it can be targeted for AD treatment remains to be established, owing to the inadequate understanding of its regulation by intracellular signaling. We employed combined biochemical, cell biological, and pharmacological approaches to investigate how SORLA trafficking and stability are regulated. Additionally, we used an AD mouse model, postmortem tissue samples, and iPSC-derived neurons to examine the functional outcomes of this regulation. We identified a novel direct interaction between SORLA and β-arrestin2 (βARR2), which impedes the interaction of SORLA with the retromer complex, thus reducing the retrograde trafficking of SORLA. βARR2 promotes the interaction between SORLA and the ESCRT0 complex, leading to the lysosomal localization and degradation of SORLA. We also found that PKCι/λ induces SORLA phosphorylation and enhances its interaction with βARR2, promoting SORLA degradation. Importantly, blocking PKCι/λ with auranofin disrupts the SORLA-βARR2 interaction, elevates SORLA levels, decreases amyloidogenic processing of APP, and improves cognition in the App<sup>NL-G-F/NL-G-F</sup> AD mouse model. Furthermore, PKCι is hyperactive in human AD brains, and auranofin reduces Aβ production in AD iPSC-derived neurons through increasing SORLA levels. Our study reveals the PKCι/λ-βARR2 axis as a key molecular mechanism that disrupts SORLA retrograde trafficking and drives its degradation. Our findings represent the first evidence that SORLA levels can be pharmacologically manipulated through blocking PKCι/λ to reduce Aβ production and alleviate AD-related phenotypes. Notably, repurposing auranofin, an FDA-approved drug for rheumatoid arthritis, may offer the potential for AD treatment.",Molecular neurodegeneration,2025,Hasibur Rehman; Shun Yan; Shalini Saggu; Mae Aida; Fang Zhang; Yang Shu; Alexis Jones; Amy Trang; Emily Dew; Wenbo Zhi; Emily T Claeboe; Anthony J Baucum; Guangyu Wu; Kai Jiao; Qin Wang
40551134,Effects of virtual reality-based exercise intervention in young people with attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder: a systematic review.,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder among the young population in the world. Young people with ADHD are often affected in their performance of attention, behavior, and executive functions (EFs), leading to a limited quality of life. Recently, Virtual reality (VR)-based exercise has been used as an intervention for young people with ADHD. Therefore, this review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of VR-based exercise in improving EFs and reducing ADHD symptoms in young people. This review aims to systematically review the effects of VR-based exercise on the overall EFs and their subdomains, as well as ADHD symptoms in young people with ADHD. This review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO CRD42024604205) and was funded by the National Science and Technology Council, R.O.C., with the project number 112-2314-B002-119-MY3. Studies were identified in five databases (Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, SCOPUS, and Embase) from September 2010 through September 2024. Studies that applied VR-based exercise intervention on young participants with ADHD were included in this systematic review. A total of 6 studies met the inclusion criteria and were considered high quality according to standardized assessment lists. Based on the 6 included studies and a total of 192 participants, the results showed that VR-based exercise with moderate to vigorous intensity provides positive effects on multiple subdomains of EFs (inhibitory control, attention, working memory, switching, and planning) and clinical symptoms in young people with ADHD. Furthermore, fully immersive and semi-immersive VR-based exercise interventions yielded similar results. VR-based exercise effectively improves EFs and is feasible for young people with ADHD, with benefits observed across ages and with sessions over 30 min. However, more evidence is essential for VR-based exercise intervention, which may compare the effects to other intervention types. Additionally, studies with rigorous experimental design are warranted.",Journal of neuroengineering and rehabilitation,2025,Jia-Ling Sun; Xiao-Jun Chaw; Shane Fresnoza; Hsiao-I Kuo
40551125,Magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of different compression locations in patients with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy.,"Studies showed that T2-weighted turbo spin-echo SPACE (T2-SPACE) could be superior to conventional two-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (2D MRI) to detect the locations of nerve root compression. However, there is a lack of evidence in patients with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy (CSR). This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic value of contrast‑enhanced 3D T2-SPACE sequence in patients with CSR. This cohort study enrolled 80 adult CSR patients from October 2021 to May 2023. Patients were allocated into 2D MRI positive and negative groups based on the findings of accurate location of nerve root compression. The nerve root compression diagnostic value was evaluated on 2D MRI, contrast‑enhanced 3D T2-SPACE MRI, and surgical findings. Cervical lordosis, the height of the foramina, and the proximal tilting angle of the nerve root (PTA) were measured. Of the 80 patients, 69 patients were diagnosed correctly by 2D MRI, and 11 patients were correctly diagnosed by contrast-enhanced 3D T2-SPACE MRI. Of those, 0 were false-positive and 9 patients were false-negative compression. Seven out of eleven patients from 2D MRI- group located nerve root compression at foraminal area and the other 4 located nerve root compression at lateral zone. All the negative cases in 2D MRI were correctly diagnosed by contrast-enhanced 3D T2-SPACE MRI. Larger PTAs could be indicators for the diagnosis of foraminal nerve root compression. Our results showed that contrast-enhanced 3D T2-SPACE MRI was more accurate than 2D MRI for detecting nerve root compression in patients with CSR. The contrast-enhanced 3D T2-SPACE could better visualize the nerve root compression intra- and extra-foramina than conventional 2D MRI.",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,2025,Yu Wang; Xiaolong Chen; Xiang-Yu Li; Dongfan Wang; Dongdong Rong; Zheng Sun; Jie Lu; Shibao Lu
40551099,Glymphatic dysfunction in classical trigeminal neuralgia: DTI-ALPS index stratification from healthy controls to post-MVD.,"The diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) index is a non-invasive marker of glymphatic function. Its relevance in classical trigeminal neuralgia (CTN), postoperative glymphatic changes after microvascular decompression (MVD), and associations with clinical and structural measures remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate glymphatic dysfunction in CTN, examine postoperative DTI-ALPS alterations, explore correlations with clinical indicators, and assess relationships with hippocampal, amygdala, and ventricular volumes. Fifty-three unilateral CTN patients undergoing MVD and 47 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent 3.0 T MRI including DTI and 3D T1-weighted imaging. The DTI-ALPS indices were computed preoperatively and at the 6-month follow-up, with volumes of the bilateral hippocampi, amygdalae, and lateral ventricles also being determined. Clinical variables included pain severity (VAS, BNI scales), neurovascular compression (NVC) grades, disease duration, carbamazepine dosage, psychological status (PHQ-9, GAD-7), and sleep quality (PSQI). Statistical methods included independent and paired t-tests, Pearson's and Spearman's correlation analyses, multivariate regression, and ROC curve analysis. Preoperatively, CTN patients showed significantly lower DTI-ALPS indices compared to healthy controls (HCs) on the left, right, and whole-brain (all p < 0.05). Six months post-MVD, only right-side indices remained reduced (p = 0.044). CTN patients also had smaller hippocampal and amygdala volumes and enlarged lateral ventricles versus HCs (all p < 0.05), with no postoperative recovery (all p > 0.05). Preoperative whole-brain DTI-ALPS indices positively correlated with hippocampal volumes and negatively with lateral ventricular volumes. Multivariate regression identified older age and female sex as predictors of lower DTI-ALPS index. ROC analysis indicated preliminary diagnostic potential for distinguishing CTN from HCs (AUC = 0.609, sensitivity/specificity = 83%). CTN is characterized by persistent glymphatic impairment and structural atrophy-hippocampal and amygdala volume loss with ventricular enlargement-that do not normalize at 6 months post-MVD. Older age and female sex are key modulators of glymphatic dysfunction, while classic clinical indicators show no correlation. Combined DTI-ALPS and volumetric MRI metrics may serve as biomarkers for central nervous system involvement and long-term monitoring in CTN.",The journal of headache and pain,2025,Xiaolin Hou; Bo Wu; Ruxiang Xu; Cheng Yin
40551098,Adverse events associated with gepants: a pharmacovigilance analysis based on the FDA adverse event reporting system.,"Gepants have demonstrated notable benefits in migraine therapy, yet their safety profiles are not thoroughly investigated. This study comprehensively analyzed the adverse event (AE) risk signals of the currently approved gepants using the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database, aiming to gain better understanding of their post-marketing safety features and potential risks. All data of the gepants (rimegepant, atogepant, ubrogepant, and zavegepant) from January 1st 2020 to December 31st 2024 were retrieved from the database. Descriptive analysis was conducted to characterize the features of gepant-associated AEs. Disproportionality analysis and subsequent sensitivity analysis were employed to evaluate the risk signals of the gepants utilizing the algorithms of reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), and information component (IC). A total of 7766 reports of rimegepant, 3672 reports of atogepant, 1958 reports of ubrogepant, and 463 reports of zavegepant were identified after data processing. Most AEs were occurred within 30 days after gepant administration. The integration of disproportionality analysis and sensitivity analysis indicated that ""feeling abnormal"" was the most reported AE of rimegepant (n = 185, 6.81%, ROR<sub>025</sub> = 6.46, IC<sub>025</sub> = 2.59, PRR = 7.24, χ<sup>2</sup> = 998.58), while ""constipation"" was the most common AE of atogepant (n = 288, 16.09%, ROR<sub>025</sub> = 19.99, IC<sub>025</sub> = 4.10, PRR = 20.72, χ<sup>2</sup> = 5418.12). The most prevalent AE of ubrogepant was ""fatigue"" (n = 60, 7.19%, ROR<sub>025</sub> = 1.88, IC<sub>025</sub> = 0.84, PRR = 2.38, χ<sup>2</sup> = 48.82), whereas ""dysgeusia"" was the most frequently observed AE of zavegepant (n = 150, 45.18%, ROR<sub>025</sub> = 212.07, IC<sub>025</sub> = 6.10, PRR = 181.96, χ<sup>2</sup> = 26,975.74). Comparative analysis of AEs revealed that two AEs were shared among all gepants and zavegepant had the largest collection of unique AEs (n = 15). The present pharmacovigilance study systematically revealed the significant risk signals of gepants. The common AEs and unique AEs of the four gepants were also identified and explored. Our results would provide valuable reference for the safe use of gepants, guiding personalized drug selection in clinical practice.",The journal of headache and pain,2025,Qi Song; Siyuan Gao; Yaqian Tan
40551077,Impact of self-rated health status on sleep disturbance among elderly diabetics: finding from the indonesian family life survey.,"Insufficient sleep quality is common among elderly adults with diabetes and can exacerbate existing health issues. Psychological factors, particularly self-assessed health status, play a key role in influencing sleep quality. This study aimed to examine the relationship between self-rated health status and sleep quality in older adults with diabetes. Data were analyzed from the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS-5), conducted between late 2014 and early 2015. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify key factors associated with sleep quality in elderly diabetics, with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) reported. The study found that 15.2% of elderly participants reported poor sleep quality. A significant association was observed between poor self-rated health and diminished sleep quality (ORs = 0.15; 95% CI = 0.49-0.47, P < 0.05), indicating that older adults with diabetes who perceive their health as poor are more likely to experience sleep disturbances. The findings emphasize the importance of improving health perceptions in this population through strategies like psychological support, health education, and stress management. Sleep quality is a critical component of overall health. Addressing psychological and social factors that impact sleep may help mitigate the negative effects of poor sleep on the health of elderly adults with diabetes. Targeted interventions could improve health outcomes and enhance quality of life for this vulnerable group.",Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung,2025,Yuni Asri; Hsiao-Yean Chiu; Faizul Hasan
40551074,"Profiles of Alcohol Use Disorders, Problematic Pornography Use, and Compulsive Sexual Behavior: The Role of Mental Health, Moral Disapproval, Thought Suppression, and Self-Concealment Among Israeli-Arab Adolescents.","Alcohol use disorders (AUDs), compulsive sexual behavior (CSB), and problematic pornography use (PPU) are prevalent disorders among adolescents. Research indicates an increase in the number of adolescents engaging in daily alcohol, porn consumption, and sexual behavior, as well as an increase in the number of adolescents diagnosed with these disorders. The aim of the current study was to detect unique factors of these addictive behaviors with mental health, moral disapproval, thought suppression, and self-concealment and examine whether these factors could explain the different profile severities of AUDs, PPU, and CSB among Israeli-Arab adolescents. The sample comprised 622 Israeli-Arab adolescents (64% boys, 36% girls; ages 14-18). First, by using network analysis we found three factors: (1) alcohol use, (2) CSB, problematic pornography use, and mental health, and (3) moral disapproval, thought suppression, and self-concealment of pornography and sexual behavior. Second, by using latent profile analysis we identified five distinct profiles based on the three detected factors: (1) low alcohol use amidst high CSB and moral disapproval, thought suppression, and self-concealment; (2) low CSB, pornography, and alcohol use; (3) average CSB, pornography, and alcohol use; (4) high CSB, pornography, and alcohol use; and (5) high CSB, pornography, and alcohol use amidst low disapproval, thought suppression, and self-concealment levels. The findings underscore that unique profiles strongly correlate with different addictive behaviors among adolescents. The current research contributes to the field by offering a more personalized approach to comprehending addictive behaviors and culture-related risk factors among Israeli-Arab adolescents.",Archives of sexual behavior,2025,Misk Kabaha; Yaniv Efrati
40551064,Near-Infrared Spectroscopy to Assess Covert Volitional Brain Activity in Intensive Care.,"Detecting covert consciousness in unresponsive patients is challenging. Although functional magnetic resonance imaging and advanced electroencephalography paradigms can identify volitional brain activity, the limited accessibility of these technologies necessitates alternative approaches. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy may provide a portable solution in the intensive care unit. We assessed the feasibility of functional near-infrared spectroscopy with verbal motor commands to detect volitional brain activity in acute disorders of consciousness (DoC). Functional near-infrared spectroscopy recordings and clinical assessments were obtained from 50 patients with DoC with acute brain injury, with data analyzed post hoc and visually at the bedside. Twenty healthy volunteers served as controls. After quality control, data from 19 controls and 36 patients were analyzed. Cortical activation was detected in 18 (96%) controls and 16 (44%) patients. Among 13 minimally conscious patients, volitional activity was found in 8 (62%), whereas 8 (35%) of 23 clinically unresponsive patients showed activation. Volitional brain activity in the latter was associated with higher odds of command following within a week, although it was not statistically significant (odds ratio 3.1, 95% confidence interval 0.7-15.8; p = 0.14). Visual bedside analysis showed high specificity (90%) but moderate agreement (κ = 0.4) with post hoc computational analysis. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy with motor commands can detect volitional brain activity in acute DoC, although data quality issues remain a limitation.",Neurocritical care,2025,Pardis Zarifkar; Matthew Kolisnyk; Marwan H Othman; Melika Hassani; Karen Irgens Tanderup Hansen; Morten Hylander Møller; Kirsten Møller; Christine Sølling; Jens Christian Nilsson; Sigurdur Thor Sigurdsson; Michael E Benros; Jack de Jeu; Karnig Kazazian; John Hauerberg; Kåre Fugleholm; Peter F Birkeland; Tobias S Andersen; Jesper Kjaergaard; Daniel Kondziella
40551024,Closed-loop electrical stimulation prevents focal epilepsy progression and long-term memory impairment.,"Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) are expressed in epileptic networks and disrupt cognitive functions. It is unclear whether addressing IED-induced dysfunction could improve epilepsy outcomes, as most therapeutic approaches target seizures. We show, in a kindling model of progressive focal epilepsy, that IEDs produce pathological oscillatory coupling associated with prolonged, hypersynchronous neural spiking in synaptically connected cortex and expand the brain territory capable of generating IEDs. A similar relationship between IED-mediated oscillatory coupling and temporal organization of IEDs across brain regions was identified in human participants with refractory focal epilepsy. Spatiotemporally targeted closed-loop electrical stimulation triggered on hippocampal IED occurrence eliminated the abnormal cortical activity patterns, preventing the spread of the epileptic network and ameliorating long-term spatial memory deficits in rodents. These findings suggest that stimulation-based network interventions that normalize interictal dynamics may be an effective treatment of epilepsy and its comorbidities, with a low barrier to clinical translation.",Nature neuroscience,2025,Jose J Ferrero; Ahnaf R Hassan; Zelin Yu; Zifang Zhao; Liang Ma; Cynthia Wu; Shan Shao; Takeshi Kawano; Judah Engel; Werner Doyle; Orrin Devinsky; Dion Khodagholy; Jennifer N Gelinas
40550993,Feasibility of a web video-based positive word stimulation program for older patients with cardiac disease and subthreshold depression admitted to an acute care ward: a pilot randomized controlled trial.,"Major depressive disorder can exacerbate morbidity and hasten mortality from cardiac disorders among geriatric patients, so mitigation of subthreshold depression (StD) may help improve long-term outcome. Subliminal priming with supraliminal reward stimulation (SPSRS), in which subjects view videos with embedded positive words, may be an effective intervention strategy for StD symptom reduction. The purpose of this pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to evaluate the feasibility of an SPSRS intervention for older patients with cardiac disease and StD admitted to acute care wards. Thirty older patients with cardiac disease and comorbid StD (79.2 ± 7.55 years, six female) were randomly assigned to the intervention (SPSRS) group (n = 15) or the control group (n = 15). The intervention group viewed 10-min videos containing positive word stimulation once per day for 5 consecutive days, while the control group viewed YouTube videos containing no positive word stimulation following the same protocol. The primary outcome was a change in score on the Japanese version of the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). There were no dropouts and no adverse events during the trial. Linear mixed models showed no significant improvement in BDI-II in the intervention group compared to the control group (P = 0.72). This pilot RCT supports the feasibility of the SPSRS intervention for older patients with cardiac disease and StD. A full-scale RCT would require a larger sample size, modifications to the content for this patient group, increased frequency of daily interventions, and a more sensitive depression symptom assessment tool.

40550925,Comparative efficacy and safety of different durations of dual antiplatelet therapy in acute minor non-cardioembolic stroke: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"International guidelines recommend short-course dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for secondary prevention in patients with acute minor stroke. However, the optimal duration of such therapy remains unclear. This review aims to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of different DAPT durations in the secondary prevention of acute minor ischemic stroke. The present study systematically searched PubMed, Embase (via Ovid), Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify relevant randomized-controlled trials. The primary outcome was the incidence of all recurrent strokes. Data synthesis was performed through network meta-analysis and paired meta-analysis methodologies. A total of 7 studies with 34,646 participants were included. Compared with aspirin alone, each course of DAPT reduced the risk of recurrent stroke but increased the risk of bleeding: aspirin-clopidogrel 21 day DAPT (OR 0.75,95% CI 0.66-0.85)/(OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.16-1.89); aspirin-ticagrelor 30 day DAPT (OR 0.81,95% CI 0.70-0.95)/(OR 3.98,95% CI 1.74-9.10); aspirin-clopidogrel 90 day DAPT (OR 0.75,95% CI 0.60-0.93)/(OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.42-2.88). Compared with aspirin-clopidogrel 21 day DAPT, aspirin-ticagrelor 21 day DAPT was more efficacious with an increased risk of bleeding (OR 0.78,95% CI 0.65-0.92)/(OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.39-2.49). Network meta-analysis showed that aspirin-clopidogrel 21 day DAPT had the best risk-benefit profile, followed by aspirin-ticagrelor 21 day DAPT and aspirin-clopidogrel 90 day DAPT, with aspirin alone being the least effective. The risk-benefit profile of 21 day DAPT with aspirin-clopidogrel was superior to that of other short-course DAPTs.",Journal of neurology,2025,Wuchaonan Liu; Shengping Luo; Ruiyu Huang; Yujia Li; Dingxiang Li; Yihui Deng
40550877,Comprehensive evaluation of plasma tau biomarkers for detecting and monitoring Alzheimer's disease in a multicenter and multiethnic aging population.,"Over 20% of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) worldwide are Chinese, although the efficacy of existing blood-based measures of AD biomarkers is largely unknown in Asian cohorts. Here we explored how plasma tau biomarkers correlated with cross-sectional and longitudinal AD-related outcomes and their diagnostic performance in 1,085 participants from three independent studies, including two Chinese cohorts, Greater-Bay-Area Healthy Aging Brain Study (n = 425) and Huashan (n = 297), and the North American Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort (n = 363). Plasma p-tau217 performed best in classifying Aβ-positron emission tomography (PET) and tau-PET positivity throughout the AD continuum and correlated with all AD-related outcomes. A two-cutoff approach suggested that participants with intermediate plasma p-tau217 levels experienced rapid accumulation of Aβ-PET and entorhinal tau-PET, as well as accelerated hypometabolism and cognitive decline. Increased plasma p-tau217 was also associated with rapid longitudinal changes in Aβ-PET, tau-PET and neurodegeneration. These results suggest that plasma p-tau217 is superior in detecting multiple aspects of AD-related pathological changes and tracking disease progression.",Nature aging,2025,Guoyu Lan; Mengjie Wang; Fernando Gonzalez-Ortiz; Laihong Zhang; Anqi Li; Binyin Li; Mingxing Jiang; Jie Yang; Xuhui Chen; Dai Shi; Xiang Fan; Yue Cai; Pan Sun; Lin Liu; Jieyin Li; Zhengbo He; Lili Fang; Xin Zhou; Linting Chen; Yiying Wang; Mingxu Li; Zhen Liu; Qingyong Wang; Linsen Xu; Liemin Zhou; Guanxun Cheng; Xinlu Wang; Pengcheng Ran; Lu Wang; Kun Sun; Ying Han; Yihui Guan; Kaj Blennow; Fang Xie; Tengfei Guo
40550863,Two distinct cell types of the medial mammillary body forming segregated subcircuits.,"The medial mammillary body (MM) is an integral component of the Papez circuit and the extended hippocampal system essential for cognitive and emotional functions. However, whether MM contains morpho-electrophysiologically distinguishable, genetically identifiable neuron types, and how they interact to process information underlying diverse MM functions, has remained largely unexplored. Here we employed a multidisciplinary approach in mice, combing genetic labeling, electrophysiological recording, morphological reconstruction, viral tracing, activity monitoring and manipulation, and behavioral testing to perform an integrative analysis of MM. We identified two major neuron types in MM, distinguished by the expression of calbindin (CB) and parvalbumin (PV). These neuron types occupy complementary MM territories and exhibit discernable anatomical and physiological characteristics. Further, they display segregated outputs and differential inputs, with scarce local connectivity, forming independent subcircuits for parallel information processing. Using optogenetic activation and calcium fiber photometry, we demonstrated that CB-expressing MM neurons, but not PV-expressing ones, drive place aversion and hyperlocomotion and exhibit elevated activity during locomotion. In summary, our findings reveal the neuronal composition of MM, delineate its local and long-range circuit organization, and uncover functionally divergent, cell-type-specific subcircuits, establishing a robust framework for future investigations in both healthy and diseased states.",Molecular psychiatry,2025,Hongzhi Liu; Yun Shi; Qi Zhang; Meihui Yue; Yanqing Qi; Benlei Xu; Jiayu Jing; Linhong Zhang; Kangqi Yang; Mingfang Zheng; Jingfeng Zhou; Jiangteng Lu; Ling Gong; Miao He
40550832,Transdiagnostic neuromodulation of impulsivity: current status and future trajectories.,"Impulsivity, increasingly perceived as a transdiagnostic characteristic, significantly influences diverse psychiatric conditions and emanates beyond the boundaries defined by traditional classification systems. Transdiagnostic research has shed light on the complex clinical manifestations of impulsivity, and the underpinning neural circuitry. The pressing challenge now is to translate this enhanced understanding into precise and potent interventions tailored to these different aspects of impulsivity. Recent advancements in neuromodulation, specifically targeting brain circuits, have provided encouraging evidence for improvements in clinical symptoms, and neural circuitry across various psychiatric conditions, signposting a transformative phase in crafting interventions that tackle impulsivity from a transdiagnostic perspective. However, the field continues to ascertain a universally embraced framework that effectively amalgamates these discoveries into a unified clinical methodology. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) delivers a neuroscientifically informed framework that aims to reconcile the neurobiological underpinnings with clinical symptoms, thereby facilitating targeted neuromodulation strategies. In this context, we propose a pioneering RDoC-compliant framework that strategically targets the neural circuits implicated in clinical impulsivity symptoms, applicable across diagnostic categories. Furthermore, we introduce a set of meticulously selected tools for each stage within this framework, thus reinforcing its applicability and aiding future investigative pursuits in this area.",Translational psychiatry,2025,Gangliang Zhong; Tianzhen Chen; Na Zhong; Tara Rezapour; Abbas Haghparast; Haifeng Jiang; Hang Su; Tifei Yuan; Trevor William Robbins; Jiang Du; Min Zhao
40550812,Distinct oscillatory mechanisms in low and high alpha-band activities for screening and potential treatment of Schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia (ScZ) is characterized by prominent perceptual abnormalities. A deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying these abnormalities is crucial for developing precise treatment strategies. Our study aimed to address the following primary questions. First, the functional role of various sub-oscillations within the alpha band remains unclear. Second, we aimed to identify biomarkers for the diagnostic purposes of ScZ. Third, the broader question of whether the diagnostic biomarker can also function as a treatment biomarker remains unknown. Resting-state EEG data from 55 ScZ patients and 61 healthy controls were analyzed to compare different sub-oscillations in the alpha band and their correlation with clinical symptoms (as measured by the general psychopathology scale). We discovered that distinct topographic patterns in low (~8 Hz) and high (~12 Hz) alpha may serve specific diagnostic and evaluative purposes respectively. Moreover, a pronounced gender bias was also observed. Low-alpha-band activity appeared to have more diagnostic relevance in females. On the other hand, the high-alpha difference was more relevant for evaluating the severity of symptoms in ScZ males. Our research has brought new insights into the neural oscillation mechanism of schizophrenia, which could substantially assist the formulating diagnosis of ScZ and the development of its treatment strategies.",Translational psychiatry,2025,Chuanliang Han; Bin Wang; Xing Peng; Meijia Li; Zhizhen Zhang; Chen Yao; Mengyu Tu; Xiaoyan Chen; Jia Zhou; Changming Wang; Xixi Zhao
40550810,Long-term outcomes of Aripiprazole long-acting injectable: a 10-year mirror image study of patient acceptability and treatment effectiveness.,"Relapses are frequent in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. While long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) are effective in preventing hospital admissions and improving adherence and patient outcomes, they are still under-utilised. Furthermore, evidence from newer formulations and longitudinal studies, despite their commonly long-term use, remains limited. To address this scarcity of data, this study aims to evaluate the long-term effectiveness and acceptability of once-monthly Aripiprazole long-acting injectable (ALAI), the only third-generation antipsychotic available in long-acting formulation. In this pragmatic, independent, ten-year mirror-image study conducted within a large urban mental health service in London, UK, we assessed hospital admission rates and treatment retention over 5 years following ALAI initiation in a naturalistic adult cohort. Frequency and length of hospitalisations in the 5 years pre- and post-initiation were recorded using electronic records, as were discontinuation rates and reasons. Separate analyses were performed comparing outcomes between treatment completers and discontinuers, as well as between those with schizophrenia vs other diagnoses. In total, 135 patients were included in the study (63% with Schizophrenia, 37% with other diagnoses). The discontinuation rate was 47% at 5 years (23.7%, 13.6%, 7.9%, 7.3% and 5.3% in years 1 to 5 respectively). Among the 53% who completed 5 years of ALAI treatment, we observed an 88.5% reduction in mean number (1.57 to 0.18, p < 0.001) and a 90% reduction in mean length of hospitalizations compared to 5 years pre-ALAI initiation (103 to 10 days, p < 0.0001). Median admissions and length fell from 1 to 0 and 68 to 0 days (p < 0.001), respectively. In contrast, discontinuers (47%) exhibited inferior outcomes and showed only a 29.9% reduction in admissions over 5 years. Patients were more likely to discontinue due to poor compliance and ineffectiveness and rarely due to tolerability issues. Apart from switching to ALAI from another LAI, there were no major clinical or demographic predictors of treatment continuation. Outcomes were consistent independent of diagnosis. Potential confounders however must not be overlooked, such as the exclusion of a large number of patients due to strict eligibility criteria as well as changes to healthcare policy over the study period. This is the first study to report 5-year hospitalisation and treatment persistence outcomes with ALAI. Its sustained use was associated with substantial reductions in hospital use, with 85% of completers requiring no further admissions, compared to 30% of discontinuers. These real-world findings support the long-term value of ALAI and may help address common barriers to LAI adoption in clinical decision-making.","Schizophrenia (Heidelberg, Germany)",2025,Joshua Barnett; Sofia Pappa
40550806,Digital phenotyping of Parkinson's disease via natural language processing.,"Frontostriatal degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with language deficits, which can be identified using natural language processing, a remarkable tool for digital-phenotyping. Current evidence is mostly blind to the disorder's cognitive phenotypes. We validated an AI-driven approach to capture digital language markers of PD with and without mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, PD-nMCI) relative to healthy controls (HCs). Analyzing the connected speech of participants, we extracted linguistic features with CLAN software. Classification was performed using SVM and RFE. Discrimination between PD and HCs reached an AUC of 77%, with even better results for subgroup analyses (AUC: 85% PD-nMCI vs. HCs; 83% PD-MCI vs. HCs; 75% PD-nMCI vs. PD-MCI). Key linguistic features included retracing, action verb, utterance error, and verbless-utterance ratios. Despite the small sample size, which may limit statistical power and generalizability, this study highlights the foundational potential of linguistic digital markers for early diagnosis and phenotyping of PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2025,Simona Aresta; Petronilla Battista; Cinzia Palmirotta; Serena Tagliente; Gianvito Lagravinese; Paola Santacesaria; Allegra Benzini; Davide Mongelli; Brigida Minafra; Christian Lunetta; Adolfo M García; Christian Salvatore
40550805,Multi-omics dissection of MAPK-driven senescence unveils therapeutic vulnerabilities in KIAA1549::BRAF-fusion pediatric low-grade glioma models.,"Pilocytic astrocytomas (PA), the most common pediatric low-grade gliomas (pLGGs), are characterized by genetic MAPK pathway alterations leading to constitutive activation and oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) accompanied with the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). This study investigates the molecular mechanisms of signaling pathways regulating OIS and SASP in pLGGs using a multi-omics approach. We utilized senescent DKFZ-BT66 cells derived from a primary KIAA1549::BRAF-fusion positive PA to generate RNA-sequencing and phospho-/proteomic datasets before and after treatment with the MEK inhibitor trametinib. Multi-omics factor analysis (MEFISTO) and single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) were employed to identify key OIS effectors and differentially regulated pathways upon MAPK inhibition. Trametinib treatment inhibited MAPK activity, OIS and SASP signatures across all omics levels, functionally underscored by reduced sensitivity towards senolytic drugs. We constructed a pathway network using a prior knowledge approach, mapping n = 106 upregulated and n = 84 downregulated direct downstream effectors of MAPK leading to OIS/SASP. These effectors are associated with better progression-free survival in pLGG patients, independent of tumor site, level of resection, and genetic aberration. Several compounds targeting signaling nodes (SOD-1, IRS1, CDK1/2, CK2) involved in OIS and under MAPK control were identified, of which n = 4 were validated in an additional primary KIAA1549::BRAF fusion pLGG model as potential new therapeutic vulnerabilities for the treatment of pLGG. Our unbiased multi-omics signaling pathway analysis identifies a specific and comprehensive network of MAPK-OIS-SASP interdependencies in pLGGs and suggests new therapeutic strategies for these tumors.",Signal transduction and targeted therapy,2025,Romain Sigaud; Anja Stefanski; Florian Selt; Daniela Kocher; Diren Usta; Daniel Picard; Isabel Büdenbender; Marc Remke; Stefan M Pfister; David T W Jones; Tilman Brummer; Olaf Witt; Till Milde
40550791,Chronic exposure to milk odorant might ameliorate the depressive-like behavior of mice through gut-brain axis.,"Mental disorders are one of the leading causes of global health burden, while food flavors play a significant role in promoting the appetite and mood of people. This study aimed to investigate the intervention effects of two kinds of pleasant food odorants on depressed mice induced by reserpine. After 6-week exposure, beef odorant and milk odorant could effectively reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α), restored hippocampal structure, elevated neurotransmitters (5-HT, DA, NE), and upregulated BDNF/GFAP expression. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis revealed that both odorants could ameliorate the gut microbiota dysbiosis, increasing the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and reducing Firmicutes. Overall, milk and beef odorants showed reletively positive effect on depressed mice through gut-brain axis, where milk odorant was more pronounced. GC-MS analysis identified oleic acid in milk odorant as a potential active component. These findings highlighted food-derived odors as promising nutritional interventions for depression through neuroinflammation modulation and microbiota-gut-brain axis regulation.",NPJ science of food,2025,Yan Jin; Hongze Wang; Ziyao Zhang; Enhui Jin; Can Yang; Jing Meng; Tao Wu; Min Zhang
40550764,[A study on the relationship between etiology and influencing factors of burning mouth syndrome].,"To analyze the etiology and related influencing factors of burning mouth syndrome (BMS). A total of 109 patients with BMS who visited the Department of Stomatology of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University from November 2022 to October 2023 were selected, and 84 healthy volunteers who participated in the survey during the same period were selected as the control group. The basic information of the research subjects was recorded, and oral health status, periodontal health status and psychological status of the research subjects were evaluated. Student's t test, Chi-square test and binary logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the factors affecting the incidence of BMS with SPSS 27.0 software package. Mono-factor analysis showed that residual crown, residual root, periodontitis, anxiety status, depressive status, sleep disorders, menopause, diabetes, digestive system diseases and lacunar infarction were related to the incidence of BMS (P＜0.05). The variables with P＜0.1 in mono-factor analysis were selected for multivariate logistic regression analysis. The results showed that periodontitis, COVID-19, anxiety status, depressive status, sleep disorders, lacunar infarction, and digestive system diseases were factors affecting the incidence of BMS (P＜0.05 and OR＞1). The diagnosis and treatment of BMS require multidisciplinary cooperation of specialists such as psychiatry, neurology and gastroenterology, and active treatment of systemic or related diseases. In addition to strengthening oral hygiene and periodontal health management for patients, clinical practitioners should also pay attention to the aggravation of BMS patients' pain intensity, sleep quality and anxiety caused by COVID-19 pandemic, and provide timely psychological counseling to better control the development of BMS.",Shanghai kou qiang yi xue = Shanghai journal of stomatology,2025,Huirong Zhou; Xiaoping Lin
40550749,Resolving heterogeneity in first-episode and drug-naive major depressive disorder based on individualized structural covariance network: evidence from the REST-meta-MDD consortium.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex and heterogeneous disorder, and this heterogeneity poses a significant challenge for advancing precision medicine in patients with MDD. MRI-based subtyping analysis has been widely employed to address the heterogeneity of MDD patients. In this study, we investigated the subtypes of first-episode and drug-naive (FEDN) MDD patients based on the individualized structural covariance network (IDSCN). In this study, we used T1-weighted anatomical images of 164 FEDN MDD patients and 164 healthy controls from the REST-meta-MDD consortium. The IDSCN of participants was obtained using the network template perturbation method. Subtypes of FEDN MDD were identified using k-means clustering analysis, and differences in neuroimaging findings and clinical symptoms between the identified subtypes were compared using two-sample <i>t</i>-tests. This study identified two subtypes of FEDN MDD: subtype 1 (<i>n</i> = 117) and subtype 2 (<i>n</i> = 47) by characterizing 10 edges that were significantly altered in at least 5% of patients (i.e., 8 patients) in the IDSCN. Compared with subtype 2, subtype 1 had significantly higher anxiety symptom scores, stronger structural covariance edges in 9 edges within the thalamus, and a significantly reduced gray matter volume (GMV) in the frontal and parietal regions, and in the thalamus. Our results suggest that patients with FEDN MDD can be classified into two different subtypes based on their IDSCN, providing an important reference for personalized treatment and precision medicine for patients with FEDN MDD.",Psychological medicine,2025,Songhao Hu; Li Zhu; Xiangyang Zhang
40550726,"Predictors, Morbidity, and Healthcare Costs of Acute Kidney Injury in Diabetic Ketoacidosis: A Decade-Long Retrospective Cohort Study of 464,057 US Hospitalizations.","Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) frequently results in acute kidney injury (AKI), elevating mortality and healthcare costs. However, comprehensive national studies on AKI risk factors in DKA patients are scarce. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 464,057 hospitalizations for DKA throughout the United States from 2010 to 2019, using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database. Instances of AKI were identified through ICD-9/10 diagnostic codes, and multivariable logistic regression was applied to assess risk factors, including demographic characteristics, preexisting comorbidities, complications and institutional variables. In the analyzed cohort, 175,233 patients (37.8%) developed AKI, with its prevalence increasing from 28.2% in 2010 to 46.3% by 2019. The multivariate analysis indicated several independent risk factors: age ≥ 45 years; Black race; comorbidities ≥1; bed size of hospital (medium, large); urban and teaching hospitals; region of hospital (Midwest/North Central, South, West); preexisting comorbidities [congestive heart failure, coagulopathy, fluid and electrolyte disorders, other neurological disorders, pulmonary circulation disorders, chronic kidney disease (CKD) excluding end-stage renal disease (ESRD), weight loss, pancreatitis]. Protective factors included being female, Hispanic/Native American, having Medicaid, private insurance/self-pay, and undergoing elective admission. The development of AKI was associated with worsened outcomes, including increased complications, a greater need for invasive therapies (dialysis, ventilator support), prolonged hospital stays (median 4 vs. 3 days; P < 0.001), higher median treatment costs ($31,386 vs. $20,157; P < 0.001), and increased mortality rates (4.1% vs. 0.9%, P < 0.001).

40550723,Estimating diagnostic delay in patients with pituitary adenomas in Sweden: a cross-sectional study.,"A delayed diagnosis of pituitary adenomas (PAs) can lead to increased morbidity and reduced quality of life. The aim was to estimate diagnostic delay and investigate the concordance between patient-reported symptoms and the medical record documentation in patients with PA. Cross-sectional study. Seven university hospitals. 654 patients: non-functioning PA (NFPA, 314), prolactinoma (118), acromegaly (164) and Cushing's Disease (CD, 58). Questionnaires and medical record extraction. Type of first healthcare contact, delay of PA diagnosis and patient-reported symptoms and symptoms documented in medical records. First healthcare contact was usually a general practitioner. Estimated time from symptoms to diagnosis varied from <1 year (66%), 1-5 years (12%), 5-9 years (13%) and >10 years (9%). The longest diagnostic delays were observed in acromegaly and CD. A longer delay was observed in women compared with men (p<0.001). The most frequent patient-reported symptoms among NFPA were headache and visual disturbances; for prolactinomas, menstrual irregularities and headache; for acromegaly, change in appearance and snoring; and for CD, weight gain and tiredness. Concordance between patient-reported symptoms at diagnosis and medical records was found for visual disturbances in NFPA and prolactinomas (<i>Cohen's</i> kappa >0.6) and for menstrual irregularities in prolactinomas (<i>Cohen's</i> kappa >0.7). We report a large variation in symptom duration before diagnosis with a substantial diagnostic delay in patients with CD and acromegaly.

40550722,"Protocol for 'Re: CBT Dialysis': a realist evaluation-why, for whom and in what circumstances does cognitive behaviour therapy work for people with depressive symptoms receiving dialysis?","Nearly 40% of adults receiving life-saving dialysis for kidney failure report depressive symptoms. With more than 40 000 Canadians on dialysis, this is a significant health burden. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been shown to be effective for treating depressive symptoms; however, it is rarely considered or used for people receiving dialysis. The aim of this realist study is to evaluate and explain how, why, for whom and in what circumstances therapist-guided and remotely delivered CBT works in order to provide equitable mental healthcare to individuals with depressive symptoms receiving dialysis. The project will include a realist synthesis, a quantitative cohort study and a realist evaluation. Realist methodology is a theory-driven approach that seeks to explain how generative mechanisms are shaped by contextual features, giving rise to outcome patterns. We will begin by developing an initial programme theory (IPT) from the literature and interviews with CBT therapists to understand how CBT is intended to work and for whom. We will use data from the quantitative cohort study to identify contexts that may shape outcome patterns in CBT for people receiving dialysis. This includes previously collected survey data and data from a longitudinal cohort study, both sourced from people across Canada undergoing dialysis. We will test and refine the IPT using data from a realist evaluation and existing literature. The realist evaluation will involve participants from the quantitative cohort study who received therapist-guided, remotely delivered CBT. Ethical approvals have been granted. We have planned a wide range of dissemination strategies: journal manuscripts and conference presentations, executive memos for administrators of renal programmes in Canada, an online inventory of resources for depressive symptoms and presentations of findings together with patient partners at all participating sites.

40550578,Inspiratory muscle training for people with Parkinson's disease: a protocol for a mixed methods randomised controlled trial.,"Inspiratory muscle weakness is a known consequence of Parkinson's disease and could be a potential contributor to the dyspnoea experienced by many people living with the condition. Inspiratory muscle training is effective in improving inspiratory muscle strength and reducing dyspnoea in other chronic diseases. However, inspiratory muscle training has received little attention in people with Parkinson's disease, and it is unclear how this training affects inspiratory muscle strength, dyspnoea and quality of life. This mixed methods, randomised controlled trial will recruit 50 participants with idiopathic Parkinson's disease who will be randomly allocated to either the experimental group, for 8 weeks, or the control group. Inspiratory muscle strength (maximum inspiratory pressure) will be the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes include motor experience of daily living (Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part II), rate of perceived exertion (modified Borg Scale), exercise capacity (6-minute walk test) and quality of life (39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire). Quantitative data will be analysed using descriptive statistics. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with participants who underwent inspiratory muscle training. Inductive reflexive thematic analysis will be used to explore the participants' experiences of inspiratory muscle training and its impact on dyspnoea, activities of daily living and overall quality of life.

40550571,Exploring the mental health research priorities of parents with depression and their children.,"While patient and public involvement (PPI) in research is growing, PPI in the setting of research priorities at an early stage of the research process has been limited to date. Where research priorities have been assessed, this has been done by working with members of the general public. Research priorities are likely to vary between different groups, and families affected by depression have been recognised as an important group for research. We aimed to explore the mental health research priorities of parents with a history of depression and their children. Data came from the Early Prediction of Adolescent Depression (EPAD) study-a UK longitudinal cohort study of parents with a history of depression and their children. During interviews, parents (n=161) and their young adult children (n=131) were asked open-ended questions about their research priorities. Responses were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Parents and their young adult children highlighted the following research priority categories: treatment and intervention, including prevention and early intervention, public understanding of mental health, environmental or social factors that might contribute to poor mental health, the role of genetics in intergenerational transmission, and a developmental and intergenerational approach to research. While prior research has identified the importance of intervention and social factors, our study also identified public understanding of mental health and aetiological research, particularly on the contribution of genetics relative to environmental factors, as priorities for parents with depression and their children. Findings highlight the value of involving diverse groups in priority-setting exercises, including groups that are recognised as important for research, to allow their views to be incorporated into agenda-setting initiatives, including for research funding.",BMJ mental health,2025,Victoria Powell; Emma Meilak; Chloe Booth; Lucy Owen; Lucy Brookes-Howell; Anita Thapar; Frances Rice
40550563,"Novel fusion superkine, <i>IL-24S/IL-15</i>, enhances immunotherapy of brain cancer.","Glioblastoma (GBM) is a rapidly growing, aggressive brain tumor with very poor prognosis without currently effective therapies. The immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in GBM hinders the development of effective tumor-eradicating immunotherapies. This hostile TME can be modulated by administering immune-activating cytokines in combination with agents inducing tumor cell death. To achieve these objectives, we sought to harness the cancer-selective cell death-inducing properties of an enhanced ""Superkine"" version of melanoma differentiation associated gene-7/interleukin-24, <i>IL-24S</i>, and the immune-activating properties of <i>IL-15</i> to modulate the TME of GBM to maximize therapeutic outcomes. A fusion ""Superkine"" (<i>FSK</i>) comprised of <i>IL-24S</i> linked to <i>IL-15</i> was generated, and antitumor effects were evaluated when transduced by a type 5 adenovirus (Ad.5) in a GBM immunocompetent mouse tumor model. To target the delivery of Ad.5 <i>FSK</i> systemically, we employed an innovative approach of focused ultrasound (FUS) paired with microbubbles (MBs), FUS-DMB (FUS plus double MB), to safely transport the <i>FSK</i> engineered Ad.5 construct into mouse brain to overcome limitations of systemic viral delivery and selectivity of the blood-brain barrier. The <i>FSK</i> stimulated higher tumor regression and enhanced survival in vivo than the individual ""Superkine"" or cytokine in GBM cancer models. Apoptosis of GBM cells was induced, as well as increased tumor infiltration of T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells. The antitumor-inducing activity of FSK is a consequence of induction of cancer-specific growth suppression and induction of apoptosis (IL-24S) as well as diverse effects on immune cells (IL-15 and IL-24S). Antibody neutralization indicates that a primary immune mediator of anticancer activity of FSK is through recruitment and activation of NK cells. Global cytokine analyses indicated no changes in inflammatory cytokines during therapy, suggesting that this strategy will be safe. In summary, treatment with an <i>FSK</i>, consisting of a fusion of <i>IL-24S</i> to <i>IL-15</i>, promotes GBM cell killing and remodeling of the TME by recruiting and activating immune cells supporting the feasibility of developing safe and effective cancer immunotherapeutic fusion proteins and selective delivery in the brain for the therapy of GBM.",Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,2025,Amit Kumar; Praveen Bhoopathi; Padmanabhan Mannangatti; Santanu Maji; Anjan K Pradhan; Esha Madan; Alexander L Klibanov; Rajan Gogna; David D Limbrick; Luni Emdad; Swadesh K Das; Paul B Fisher
40550444,The Cognitive and Neurological Implications of Toxoplasma gondii Infection: Evidence from a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Toxoplasma gondii, a neurotropic parasite, has been implicated in cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD) and, to a lesser extent, Parkinson's disease (PD). While frequently asymptomatic, latent infections can disrupt neurotransmitter systems, provoke chronic neuroinflammation, and impair neuronal metabolism-mechanisms that may accelerate cognitive deterioration. This systematic review and meta-analysis included 34 observational studies with over 24,000 participants, evaluating the association between T. gondii infection and cognitive outcomes in both AD and PD populations. Meta-analytical findings demonstrated a significant association between T. gondii infection and AD (log OR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.25-0.79), with pronounced impairments observed in global cognition, verbal fluency, and memory domains. In contrast, no statistically significant association was found between T. gondii infection and PD. These findings support a potential role for T. gondii in AD pathogenesis through mechanisms such as neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction, while its relevance to PD remains inconclusive. Longitudinal and mechanistic studies are warranted to further clarify causality and inform potential therapeutic strategies targeting parasite-mediated neural injury.",Acta tropica,2025,Mahshid Kavakebian; Tina Ghandali; Hasti Nasiri; Fatemeh Ramezani-Moghadam; Saba Alizadeh; Sara Alizadeh; Melika Silakhor; Mohammad Rajabi; Amirali Mirmazhari; Parham Asgarian; Hosein Rahimi; Mehdi Karimi; Mahmood Moosazadeh

However, it is often associated with complications, including neurodevelopmental disorders, endocrine dysfunctions, and obesity. This review explores the endocrine complications linked to cranial irradiation, focusing on its impact on the pituitary gland, hypothalamus, salivary glands, and thyroid gland. We discuss how radiation-induced hormonal imbalances contribute to growth restriction, obesity, and reproductive dysfunctions, with an emphasis on gender-specific differences in these outcomes. The underlying mechanisms likely involve the heightened radiation sensitivity in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, leading to complex disruptions in hormonal regulation.

40550417,Trajectories of antidiabetic medication adherence in older adults and the effect of depression and anxiety symptoms.,"Common mental health disorders, such as anxiety and depression, significantly impact medication adherence in various chronic conditions. However, few studies have captured the evolving nature of adherence behavior, indicating a need for further investigation. The objectives were to describe adherence trajectories to antidiabetic medications among older patients and to explore the potential association between these trajectories and the presence of anxiety and depression. We conducted a secondary analysis of the ESA-S study involving 282 elderly participants who were prevalent users of antidiabetic medications. Medication adherence was measured using claims data over a 12-month period. Group-Based Trajectory Modeling (GBTM) was employed to identify distinct adherence trajectories. The association between the presence of common mental health disorders, assessed using self-reported symptoms and diagnostic codes from medico-administrative data, and adherence trajectories was estimated through multinomial logistic regressions. Four distinct adherence trajectories were identified and defined as low adherence (6.7%), fair adherence (18.1%), high adherence (37.9%), and nearly perfect adherence (37.2%). These patterns were also stable during the 12-month follow-up period. No significant association was found between common mental health disorders and medication adherence trajectories in this cohort, even after adjusting for potential confounders. Older patients with diabetes mostly depicted high adherence. Depression or anxiety did not impact adherence trajectories. However, our study was underpowered to detect small to moderate effects of these common mental health disorders.",Endocrine practice : official journal of the American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists,2025,Giraud Ekanmian; Carlotta Lunghi; Helen-Maria Vasiliadis; Line Guénette
40550391,Effect of Continuous Nursing Care on Social Function and Medication Compliance of Female Patients with Schizophrenia.,"Continuity of care is considered to be a critical indicator of quality of care and key to effective management of schizophrenia. Current studies are generally represented by data on male patients. This study examines the effects of continuity of care on social functioning, medication adherence, and readmission rates in female schizophrenic patients. 50 female patients with schizophrenia discharged from a ward of a psychiatric hospital in XX, Anhui province were selected and randomly divided into 2 groups. This is a randomized controlled trial. Patients in the intervention group were given discharge routine care, education on medication taking methods and precautions, monthly telephone follow-up visits and reminders for outpatient review, followed by continuous nursing. Patients in the control group were given conventional care. The registration number of this study is ChiCTR2400089061. When comparing the two groups at different time points, except for the pre-intervention score which was not statistically significant between the two groups, the total social functioning score of the intervention group was higher than that of the control group at all other time points, and the difference was statistically significant. The effect of intervention factors on medication adherence scores was statistically significant when compared at different time points, and the medication adherence scores of the intervention group were higher than those of the control group at all time points, with statistically significant differences. We found that patients who received extended care had significantly improved social functioning and higher medication adherence than usual care patients at various time points.",Asian nursing research,2025,Min Gao; Ke Xu; Shiyang Wang; Cuifeng Yang; Guifang Ru; Liying Chen; Gaofeng Yao; Chuanbing Li; Yumei Cai
40550381,"Prenatal exposure to benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) and the risk of autism spectrum disorders in children aged 16-37 months: A prospective cohort study.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as a neurological disorder can result from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors such as air pollution and exposure to chemical pollutants. This study tested the hypothesis that living in areas near petrochemical industries and exposure to benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) may adversely affect maternal and fetal health and increase the risk of autism. We conducted a prospective cohort study from 2019 to 2024, following 110 pregnant women divided into exposure and control groups, along with 145 children born during the study [exposure group (n = 80) and control group (n = 65)]. Prenatal urinary BTEX concentrations were measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The MCHAT-R/F screening tool was used to track the child's behavior in terms of the occurrence of autism spectrum symptoms. The results showed that the mean concentration of prenatal BTEX urine concentration in the exposed group (557 ng/l) was significantly higher than that in the control group (258 ng/l). The M-CHAT-R/F screening indicated moderate ASD risk in six exposure group children and three control group children; and high ASD risk for four exposure group children and one control group child. The findings in the exposure group revealed a higher incidence of ASD among boys compared to girls (4:2 in medium risk and 3:1 in high risk). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the prevalence of autism in the exposed group was significantly associated with exposure to benzene (OR, 2.10; 95%CI, 1.93-2.17; P<sub>value</sub><0.05) and toluene (OR, 1.7; 95%CI, 1.62-1.81; P<sub>value</sub><0.05). Living in industrial areas and perinatal exposure to BTEX compounds may increase the risk of ASD. Therefore, health impact assessment studies focusing on the health of vulnerable groups before the construction of petrochemical industries, as well as the monitoring of relevant health indices during the operational phase, should be prioritized.","Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2025,Fallah Hashemi; Lori Hoepner; Hassan Hashemi; Mohammad Hoseini; Elma Omeragić; Farahnaz Soleimani Hamidinejad; Daniela Haluza; Magdalena Mititelu; Cui Guo
40550295,Xiaoyaosan alleviates chronic psychological stress-induced TH17/Treg imbalance via modulation of the FKBP5/NF-κB axis.,"Xiaoyaosan (XYS), a classical herbal formulation indicated for ""depression syndrome"", can improve chronic stress-related mood disorders and immune disorders through multi-target modulation of inflammatory mediators, although its precise mechanism in regulating Th17/Treg balance remains to be clarified. This study aims to elucidate the regulatory impact of XYS on the peripheral Th17/Treg immunological imbalance generated by chronic psychological stress through modulation of the FKBP5/NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby establishing a mechanistic foundation for developing innovative interventions with dual stress-adaptogenic and immunoregulatory properties. FKBP5 knockout (FKBP5<sup>-/-</sup>) and C57BL/6 mice underwent a 35-day chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) paradigm. C57BL/6 mice were subsequently treated with XYS (1.61, 3.22, and 6.44 g/kg/d), fluoxetine (3 mg/kg/d). Behavioral phenotyping included the Open Field Test (OFT), Tail Suspension Test (TST), Forced Swimming Test (FST) and Sucrose preference test (SPT). Serum inflammatory cytokines (IL-17A, IL-23, IL-10, TNF-α) measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent test (ELISA). Splenic Th17/Treg subset ratios were analyzed using multicolor flow cytometry. Western blotting evaluated FKBP5 expression and NF-κB pathway dynamics (IκB-α degradation, P65 nuclear translocation). UPLC-HRMS-based phytochemical profiling coupled with molecular docking elucidated XYS-FKBP5 interactions. FKBP5/IKKα/β complex formation was validated through confocal immunofluorescence (IF) colocalization and reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation (CO-IP) assays. CUMS mice exhibited significant depression-like behaviors and hippocampal neuronal damage, concomitant with elevated serum corticosterone levels and Th17/Treg immune dysregulation. Medium- and high-dose XYS interventions substantially ameliorated these behavioral abnormalities, reversed hippocampal pathological alterations, suppressed pro-inflammatory responses, and rectified Th17/Treg imbalance. Crucially, XYS exerted therapeutic effects through targeted suppression of FKBP5-IKK complex interaction, effectively blocking NF-κB nuclear translocation, thereby restoring Th17/Treg homeostasis. XYS ameliorates chronic psychological stress-induced Th17/Treg immune imbalance through FKBP5-targeted suppression of NF-κB hyperactivation. This multicomponent synergistic mechanism establishes a novel therapeutic strategy for stress-associated inflammatory comorbidities, particularly depression with immune dysregulation.",Journal of ethnopharmacology,2025,Yi Zhang; Xiao-Ru Luo; Yu-Hang Zhou; Qian-Yin Xue; Shu-Ya Wu; Jing-Yu Xu; Guo-Hui Li; Bu-Ping Liu; Ming-Jia Zhang; Guang-Dong Tong; A O Hai-Qing; Mian-Mian Liao
40550283,Covarying gray and white matter networks characterize schizophrenia and bipolar disorders on a continuum: A data fusion machine learning approach and a brain network analysis.,"Schizophrenia (SZ) and Bipolar disorder (BD) share genetic and cerebral abnormalities, supporting an expanded continuum hypothesis. In this paper, we aim to better characterize differences and commonalities of gray and white matter features between SZ and BD to clarify how they align or diverge on this continuum. We transposed independent vector analysis (tIVA), a data fusion technique, to the gray and white matter images of 128 individuals diagnosed with SZ, 128 with BD and 127 healthy controls (CTRL), matched for gender, age and IQ. Of the 18 tIVA networks detected, three differed between SZ and BD (tIV9,14,15), primarily involving fronto-temporal regions. These same networks plus two more (tIV3,4), differed between SZ and CTRL indicating a larger compromission, whereas only one network (tIV9) differed between BD and controls. Overall, SZ displayed the more pronounced GM-WM abnormalities in both extent and severity. With BD lying in an intermediate position. Of note, one network differed among all three groups (SZ, BD, and CTRL). Random forest classification confirmed these results by indicating the tIV9 as the main predictors that separate the three groups. Moreover, to appreciate eventual differences between networks across the three groups a network analyses was performed. Individuals with SZ demonstrated a significantly different clustering coefficient and density compared to CTRL. While the comparison between individuals with BD and controls did not show marked differences. This study sheds new lights on the expanded continuum hypothesis according to which individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder lay on the same continuum of neurological abnormalities.",Journal of affective disorders,2025,Alessandro Grecucci; Alessandro Scarano; Francesco Bruno; Gerardo Salvato; Xiaoping Yi; Massimo Stella
40550277,Phenotyping extracellular vesicles and their serotonin transporter cargo in major depressive disorder.,"With their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, transport and regulate the release of various signaling molecules, extracellular vesicles (EVs) constitute a novel avenue to study intercellular communication in various pathologies, including psychiatric disorders. We studied 34 major depressive disorder (MDD) patients and 57 healthy controls and characterized EVs isolated from plasma using digital holographic tomography (DHT) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). EVs detected in DHT were markedly smaller and less variable in size in MDD patients. Furthermore, a lower variance of refractive indices related to the dry mass density of EVs was observed in patients. Meanwhile, NTA revealed a trend for elevated concentration of EVs in MDD. In DHT, EV dimensions correlated with plasma mRNA expression of exosomal markers CD63 and CD9, with corresponding alterations in MDD. Levels of EV concentration and CD9 were both negatively correlated with antidepressant treatment response. Utilizing electron microscopy and immunoblots we confirmed the presence of serotonin transporters (SERT) as EV cargo. SERT levels in EVs correlated with cerebral SERT binding potential in the amygdala measured using positron emission tomography. Next to the implication of altered EV communication in mood disorders, the pronounced differences in plasma EV characteristics and exosomal markers in MDD might inform the development of assays with diagnostic or prognostic value for clinical practice.

40550276,Bidirectional relationships between cognitive decline and depression: A study of middle-aged and older adults using cross-lagged panel network analysis.,"Cognitive decline and depressive symptoms are common in middle-aged and older adults. Two competing theories-Scar Theory and Vulnerability Theory-offer insights into this relationship. Scar Theory suggests depression causes cognitive impairments, while Vulnerability Theory posits cognitive deficits predispose individuals to depression. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing effective interventions, especially in underrepresented regions like China. We applied cross-lagged panel network (CLPN) analysis to three waves (2015, 2018, 2020) of data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), comprising 14,961 participants aged ≥45 years. Cognitive functions were assessed using the MMSE subscales, and depressive symptoms using the CESD-10. Analyses were conducted separately for males and females, and network centrality metrics were used to identify key bridge symptoms. The results show that cognitive functions (particularly memory and orientation) predicted depressive symptoms at earlier stage, while hopelessness and low energy subsequently contributed to cognitive decline. Centrality analysis found memory and hopelessness emerged as key bridge symptoms. Sex-specific patterns were also observed: cognitive-to-depressive pathways were more prominent in females, whereas depressive-to-cognitive effects were more pronounced in males. Causal inference is limited by the observational design. COVID-19 in the 2020 wave may have introduced external confounders. These findings provide empirical support for both the scar and vulnerability hypotheses and underscore the importance of early, symptom-specific interventions-particularly those targeting memory and hopelessness-in mitigating the reciprocal risks of depression and cognitive decline in Chinese aging populations.",Journal of affective disorders,2025,Xu Ma; Xingyu Zhou; Yuran Qiu
40550274,Comorbidities and emotions - unpacking the sentiments of pediatric patients with multiple long-term conditions through social media feedback: A large language model-driven study.,"The emotional and psychological challenges faced by children with multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs) remain underexplored. This study aimed to analyze sentiments and emotions expressed by this vulnerable population and their caregivers on social media, assess the effects of comorbidities and the COVID-19 pandemic on emotional well-being. Narratives from the Care Opinion platform (2008-2023) were analyzed by a model called CoEmoBERT, developed using the large language model, distilroberta-base transformer model. The CoEmoBERT-based sentiment analysis categorized emotions into ""Positive"", ""Negative"", and ""Neutral,"" with further refinements into specific emotions such as ""Sad,"" ""Fear"", ""Satisfied"" etc. through pretraining and transferring process. Comorbidity associations with emotions were analyzed. We further examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient sentiments and investigated temporal trends in emotional expressions. Of 389 narratives, 93.8 % reflected negative sentiments, with ""Sad"" (60.9 %) and ""Fear"" (15.4 %) being the most prevalent. Negative emotions were linked to severe comorbidities like asthma, cancer, and chronic pain, highlighting the emotional burden of managing MLTCs. Positive sentiments (5.9 %) were associated with effective communication and exceptional healthcare experiences. The analysis revealed strong associations between certain comorbidity combinations and specific emotional responses, with mental health conditions showing the most diverse range of comorbidities and emotional impacts. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated negative sentiments, particularly sadness and disgust. This study underscores the significant emotional burden on children with MLTCs, emphasizing the need for integrated care approaches to both physical and emotional well-being. These findings can guide the development of patient-centered care for this population.",Journal of affective disorders,2025,Temidayo I Oluwalade; Hossein Ahmadi; Lin Huo; Richard Sharpe; Shang-Ming Zhou

The findings highlight the urgent need for high-quality research across all four domains on older trauma survivors. Future studies should focus on older under-represented groups, such as women; individuals with multiple comorbidities, including neurocognitive disorders; and populations in low-income and middle-income countries.

40550222,Sclerostin: A Potential Link between Osteoporosis and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are age-related health conditions that significantly impact patients and society. Sclerostin, a glycoprotein secreted by osteocytes, regulates bone metabolism by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which controls bone formation. Elevated sclerostin levels in osteoporosis contribute to increased bone resorption and reduced osteoblast activity. Recent studies suggest that sclerostin also affects the central nervous system, where its expression in brain tissues may impair synaptic function and accelerate cognitive decline in AD. Both osteoporosis and AD share common risk factors, such as aging, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress, which exacerbate disease progression. Targeting sclerostin with therapies like Romosozumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits sclerostin activity, has shown promise in treating osteoporosis by promoting bone formation. Given the potential connection between sclerostin and AD, there is growing interest in exploring sclerostin modulation as a therapeutic strategy for AD, though challenges such as crossing the blood-brain barrier remain. This review discusses the emerging relationship between osteoporosis and AD, emphasizing the shared molecular pathways and the potential for sclerostin-targeted therapies to benefit both conditions. Further research is needed to understand the causal links between sclerostin, osteoporosis, and AD, and to assess the effectiveness of sclerostin modulation in managing both diseases simultaneously.",Neuro-degenerative diseases,2025,Ziyang Guo; Qian Xu; Kexin Zhang; Yujie Ma; Sufang Sheng; Dongqing Jing; Xiaodong Sun; Chengxia Kan; Xinjun Yu
40550173,Circadian Rhythm Resynchronization as a Targeted Intervention for Mood Stability in Bipolar Disorder.,"The circadian rhythm is a ubiquitous process, primarily regulated by the fluctuation in light and temperature. Research has shown that the implication of the circadian rhythm spans all aspects of physiology, including cognitive and mood functions. The circadian rhythm is a highly conserved transcriptional translational feedback loop. Specifically, the protein products of Bmal1 and Clock genes heterodimerize outside the nucleus and re-enter to activate their repressing genes. All nucleated cells in mammalian body express this intrinsic clock, and all the tissues are synchronized by the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus which receives light information from the retina. Emerging evidence shows that dysregulation of the circadian rhythm underlies the symptoms of many neurocognitive conditions such as bipolar disorder. The release of all neurotransmitters is circadian regulated. Therefore, studies that characterize the role of circadian rhythmicity in regulating cognitive and mood function in BD are essential for illuminating the therapeutic path. The efficacy of entrainment in managing symptoms of BD has been shown previously. Additionally, common therapeutic interventions for BD such as valproic acid, SSRIs and lithium have been shown to impact the circadian rhythm, partially explaining their therapeutic effect. I propose a bench protocol for enhancing the rhythmicity of SCN human explants. This will provide groundwork an in-patient regimen that stimulates the SCN activity through methods shown success in culture. I hypothesize that returning the circadian cycle in BD to a rhythmic baseline leads to physiological changes that are observable by the patient and psychiatrist in an encounter, such as changes in sleep quality and melatonin level in saliva. This approach can also promote insight and help the patient regulate their activities and emotions to improve their mood symptoms. The jet lag phenomenon is a stark example of observable physiological changes, showing that circadian reset provides the thermodynamic potentiality for introspection.",South Dakota medicine : the journal of the South Dakota State Medical Association,2025,Delaram Moradpour; Lee Baugh
40550160,Experience of the First Epilepsy Monitoring Unit in South Dakota.,"Long term video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring in an epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of seizure disorders and differentiating epileptic seizures from non-epileptic events. EMUs provide 24-hour monitoring with specially trained staff, mounted cameras for seizure observation, the ability to withdraw anti-epileptic medication and the ability to utilize seizure provoking techniques such as hyperventilation and sleep deprivation. These benefits allow EMUs to obtain a definitive diagnosis in as many as 88% of visits. South Dakota opened its first EMU in January of 2024 allowing more patients to remain in-state for seizure diagnosis and increasing the quality of epilepsy care in South Dakota. A retrospective analysis was performed of patients undergoing elective vEEG monitoring in South Dakota's first EMU from January 2024 to October 2024. Data points were recorded including patient demographics, reason for admission, adverse events during admission and outcome of the study. Thirty-six vEEG studies were conducted between January 1, 2024, and October 11, 2024. The median age of patient was 34.5 years with 21 females (58.3%) and 15 males (41.7%) served. Hispanic and Native American were the highest represented minorities, each forming 8.3% of patients. The median length of study was 93 hours. Twenty-seven studies (75.0%) were considered diagnostically conclusive while capturing a clinical event or recording epileptiform EEG activity that aided in diagnosis. Twenty-six EMU visits (72.2%) resulted in a medication change prior to discharge. Only 5 studies (13.9%) conducted in the EMU experienced adverse events including status epilepticus, rash, UTI and agitation. The EMU has been an invaluable addition to medical care in South Dakota. It provides a safe and reliable diagnostic study that allows for better diagnosis and improved treatment of seizure patients while staying closer to home.",South Dakota medicine : the journal of the South Dakota State Medical Association,2025,Colton Carlson; Kaitlyn Schaunaman; Kaitlyn Gonzalez Otarula
40550130,Young People's Experiences Using a Digital Mental Health Tool to Support Their Care in a Real-World Service: Lived Experience-Led Qualitative Study.,"The uptake of digital mental health tools (DMHTs) in mental health services is suboptimal, limiting key avenues to facilitate personalized and measurement-based care. This misses critical opportunities for enhanced patient-clinician communication, improved assessment, and early intervention. This paper aims to understand young people's experiences and perceptions of engaging with a DMHT to support their care in a real-world setting over time. This study is part of a larger randomized controlled trial, where an added human support, the digital navigator (DN), provided technological and engagement assistance for young people to use a DMHT as part of usual care. The DN conducted 118 semistructured interviews with 73 young people (mean age 22.7, SD 2.7 y) at baseline and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up visits. We found that the majority of young people were enthusiastic about incorporating a DMHT into their care when they understood its potential to facilitate shared decision-making and enhance self-awareness of their mental health. Notably, the DN's support was effective in fostering this understanding at the initial stages of implementation. However, it was evident that the lack of clinician buy-in for using the DMHT posed a risk of disillusionment to young people's sustained engagement with the tool. Young people perceived that clinician uptake of the tool was poor, limiting its perceived value addition and sustainability. Young people want to use DMHTs in their care and DNs can effectively facilitate implementation through ongoing engagement and technical support. However, successful implementation of DMHTs also depends on broader systemic factors, particularly on clinician and service engagement. Future research should examine how to address these contextual barriers and optimize DN support for implementation and sustained engagement of DMHTs.",JMIR mental health,2025,Carla Gorban; Min K Chong; Adam Poulsen; Ashlee Turner; Haley M LaMonica; Sarah McKenna; Elizabeth M Scott; Ian B Hickie; Frank Iorfino
40550124,A Customized Neural Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Target for Functional Disability Among Veterans With Co-Occurring Alcohol Use Disorder and Mild Traumatic Brain Injury: Protocol for a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) commonly co-occur, exacerbating symptoms and negatively impacting function. Co-occurring AUD and mTBI (AUD+mTBI) represents a unique and heterogeneous brain state impacting symptoms and function. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive neuromodulatory treatment with burgeoning evidence for improving brain function and symptoms for AUD and mTBI each alone. However, there is no consensus on the optimal neural target or treatment site of stimulation for either condition alone or when they co-occur. This study aims to (1) test the preliminary efficacy of high-frequency rTMS provided to a customized neural target to treat functional disability among veterans with AUD+mTBI and (2) assess the sustainability of rTMS effects on functional disability among veterans with AUD+mTBI. This single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) involved treatment-seeking veterans with AUD+mTBI recruited from a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital. Veterans will be randomly assigned to (1) a novel TMS target site using neuronavigation or (2) standard clinical left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using the Beam F3 method. All participants first receive 10 daily sessions of sham rTMS, followed by 10 daily sessions of active rTMS (10 Hz) provided by a trained TMS administrator. Veterans will complete self-report study questionnaires before and after sham and active rTMS session blocks as well as at 2-week, 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month posttreatment follow-up time points. The primary outcome is the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0. The secondary outcomes include alcohol use on the Timeline Follow-Back calendar, the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale, the Obsessive-Compulsive Drinking Scale, the Alcohol Craving Questionnaire, the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory, the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire. This study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the Edward Hines Jr Department of Veterans Affairs Hospital (19-021). This study includes a Food and Drug Administration investigational device exemption (G180292). A 6-year research plan timeline was developed, including cost and no-cost extensions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of June 2025, overall, 27 veterans with AUD+mTBI who had been enrolled in the study had completed the neural target identification phase and were awaiting enrollment in the RCT phase. Data collection for the RCT phase will be initiated soon and is expected to be completed by April 2026. We expect the results of this study to be available by May 2027. We will be able to provide preliminary evidence of the efficacy, safety, and feasibility of a novel TMS target for veterans with AUD+mTBI.

40550119,Exploring Factors Related to Social Isolation Among Older Adults in the Predementia Stage Using Ecological Momentary Assessments and Actigraphy: Machine Learning Approach.,"As the global population ages, the economic burden of dementia continues to rise. Social isolation-which includes limited social interaction and feelings of loneliness-negatively affects cognitive function and is a significant risk factor for dementia. Individuals with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment represent predementia stages in which functional decline may still be reversible. Therefore, identifying factors related to social isolation in these at-risk groups is crucial, as early detection and intervention can help mitigate the risk of further cognitive decline. This study aims to develop and validate machine learning models to identify and explore factors related to social interaction frequency and loneliness levels among older adults in the predementia stage. The study included 99 community-dwelling older adults aged 65 years and above in the predementia stage. Social interaction frequency and loneliness levels were assessed 4 times daily using mobile ecological momentary assessment over a 2-week period. Actigraphy data were categorized into 4 domains: sleep quantity, sleep quality, physical movement, and sedentary behavior. Demographic and health-related survey data collected at baseline were also included in the analysis. Machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, Gradient Boosting Machine, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, were used to explore factors associated with low social interaction frequency and high levels of loneliness. Of the 99 participants, 43 were classified into the low social interaction frequency group, and 37 were classified into the high loneliness level group. The random forest model was the most suitable for exploring factors associated with low social interaction frequency (accuracy 0.849; precision 0.837; specificity 0.857; and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.935). The Gradient Boosting Machine model performed best for identifying factors related to high loneliness levels (accuracy 0.838; precision 0.871; specificity 0.784; and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.887). This study demonstrated the potential of machine learning-based exploratory models, using data collected from mobile ecological momentary assessment and wearable actigraphy, to detect vulnerable groups in terms of social interaction frequency and loneliness levels among older adults with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment. Our findings highlight physical movement as a key factor associated with low social interaction frequency, and sleep quality as a key factor related to loneliness. These results suggest that social interaction frequency and loneliness may operate through distinct mechanisms. Ultimately, this approach may contribute to preventing cognitive and physical decline in older adults at high risk of dementia.

40550117,A Mobile App (Joint Effort) to Support Cannabis Use Self-Management and Reinforce the Use of Protective Behavioral Strategies: Development Process and Usability Testing.,"Canada's legalization of recreational cannabis use (CU) has further highlighted the need for innovative interventions that promote lower-risk CU. Young adults aged 18-25 years represent the age group with the highest prevalence of CU. Protective behavioral strategies (PBSs) have been shown to help manage CU and reduce its negative consequences. To date, only a few interventions have focused on PBSs. To address this gap, a mobile app prototype using PBSs to influence CU was developed with and for young adults. This study aims to describe the development process and usability testing of Joint Effort, a CU self-management mobile app prototype centered on promoting the use of PBSs among young adults with any past 30-day CU. Intervention mapping (IM) and a co-design approach were used. Six steps were followed: (1) focus groups were conducted to identify needs and preferences regarding CU interventions; (2) a matrix of change objectives was used to select target behaviors and determinants; (3) theory-based intervention methods and practical applications were selected; (4) focus groups were held to validate the intervention structure and examples of tailored messages; (5) preliminary intervention content was created; and (6) the intervention content was transposed into a mobile app prototype. Usability was assessed through qualitative semistructured interviews and the User Version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale (uMARS), completed by a sample of 20 university students with a mean age of 21.8 (median 22) years, 14 (70%) of whom were women and 15 (75%) were undergraduates. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Four themes were identified from the interviews: Joint Effort was visually pleasing and easy to use; the content was well-adapted to the target audience and nonjudgmental; customization functions were appreciated; and the app was perceived as helpful and relevant for initiating behavior change. The prototype received a mean quality score of 4.43/5.0 (SD 0.53) per item on the uMARS. The mean scores on the 5 subscales were as follows: engagement (4.14, SD 0.53), functionality (4.60, SD 0.47), aesthetics (4.53, SD 0.52), information quality (4.44, SD 0.61), and subjective quality (3.36, SD 0.53). Our findings highlight the added value of IM and a co-design approach, underscoring the importance of incorporating user feedback in the development of mobile apps. Building on the strong usability results, the Joint Effort prototype has since been developed into an iOS mobile app, and larger-scale evaluations are currently underway to assess its acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy.",JMIR formative research,2025,José Côté; Patricia Auger; Gabrielle Chicoine; Jinghui Cheng; Sylvie Cossette; Guillaume Fontaine; Christine Genest; Shalini Lal; Judith Lapierre; M Gabrielle Pagé; Marc-André Maheu-Cadotte; Geneviève Rouleau; Billy Vinette; Didier Jutras-Aswad
40550099,"Elevated soluble CD226 in Takayasu arteritis is useful for differentiation from giant cell arteritis, disease activity assessment, and prognosis prediction.","Takayasu arteritis (TAK) is characterized by vascular injury, in which endothelial cells and immune cells including natural killer cells, have key roles. CD226 is an activating receptor expressed on natural killer cells and T cells, and the soluble form of CD226 (sCD226) is increased in diseases involving these cells. Therefore, we investigated the utility of serum sCD226 as a biomarker for TAK. Serum sCD226 levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 34 TAK patients and 21 giant cell arteritis (GCA) patients. The associations between sCD226 levels and the angiographic classification, disease activity, and prognosis of TAK were analyzed. Serum sCD226 levels were significantly higher in TAK patients than in GCA patients. In patients with TAK, serum sCD226 levels were significantly elevated in the group of type Ⅴ compared with type Ⅰ to Ⅳ. Serum sCD226 levels were also elevated in patients with active TAK and in those with poor responses to corticosteroids. Moreover, the cumulative probability of relapse was increased in patients with high sCD226 levels. Serum sCD226 levels differentiated TAK from GCA and were associated with disease activity and relapse of TAK. Thus, serum sCD226 might be a useful biomarker for the management of TAK.",Medicine,2025,Miki Nakano; Masahiro Ayano; Shoichi Fukui; Nozomi Iwanaga; Tomofumi Tatsutani; Ayako Takaki-Kuwahara; Yasutaka Kimoto; Mitsuteru Akahoshi; Kiyoshi Migita; Atsushi Kawakami; Yoshifumi Tada; Hiroaki Niiro
40550098,Evaluating the effect of metformin on sarcopenia: A Mendelian randomization study.,"Sarcopenia is prevalent among elder patients with type 2 diabetes. As a first-line medication for managing type 2 diabetes, metformin has shown controversial effects on sarcopenia. This study aims to analyze the impact of metformin on sarcopenia using Mendelian randomization analysis. We selected 30 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with metformin used as instrumental variables from genome-wide association studies. Mendelian randomization was conducted using inverse variance weighted (IVW), Mendelian randomization Egger, and weighted median methods. Additionally, we performed heterogeneity tests, Pleiotropy analyses, and sensitivity analyses to validate our findings. The IVW method indicated a P-value of .63 and an odds ratio (OR) of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.69-1.25) for the relationship between metformin use and walking pace. For appendicular lean mass, the IVW method showed a P-value of .42 and an OR of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.28-1.70). In contrast, the IVW analysis indicated a significant relationship between metformin use and right hand grip strength, with P-value of .01 and OR (95% CI) = 0.64 (0.45-0.91), as well as for left hand grip strength, with P-value of .01 and OR (95% CI) = 0.65 (0.45-0.92). Notably, a causal relationship was established between metformin use and lower hand grip strength, while no causal relationship was found between metformin use and walking pace or appendicular lean mass. This study suggests that caution is needed regarding long-term metformin use in the context of sarcopenia.",Medicine,2025,Cheng Fan; Shiyuan Huang; Chunhua Xiang; Yi Song
40550095,Early repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the spinal cord region for the treatment of spinal cord injury: A case report.,"Currently, the global incidence of spinal cord injury (SCI) ranges from approximately 10.4 to 83 cases per million individuals, with an estimated 500,000 new cases diagnosed annually. Current clinical treatments for SCI primarily include early surgical intervention, pharmacological therapy, and personalized rehabilitation programs. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive, painless, and relatively safe treatment option that avoids the side effects and dependency associated with medications. In recent years, TMS has emerged as a promising approach in SCI rehabilitation. However, TMS is often administered late in the course of treatment and typically requires stimulation of multiple sites, which can be time-consuming, cumbersome, and may limit its effectiveness. Recently, we conducted ultra-early single-site TMS on a patient with SCI. Notably, the patient experienced rapid recovery from both motor and sensory impairments, representing a highly successful application of TMS in SCI treatment. The patient is a 57-year-old male who developed low back pain a week ago without any apparent cause. After sitting for extended periods, the pain intensified, making it difficult to turn over. He experienced numbness and weakness in both lower limbs, as well as sensory numbness in the saddle area. The rehabilitation evaluation concluded an incomplete SCI, with significant muscle weakness in both lower limbs accompanied by pain, rendering the patient dependent on others for daily care. TMS was administered as a single-target treatment for the L4/L5 intervertebral disc. The treatment parameters included a frequency of 25 Hz, 20 single stimuli per session, a stimulation duration of 0.8 seconds, an interval of 15 seconds between sessions, 76 repetitions per session, and a total of 1520 stimuli per session. The treatment was administered once daily for 5 consecutive days each week, followed by 2 days of rest, and repeated the following week. After 1 week of treatment, the pain in both lower limbs was significantly alleviated. After 2 weeks, the patient was able to walk independently without the aid of a walker, exhibiting a cross-domain gait. Four weeks later, the patient could walk independently with a normal gait and was able to perform activities of daily living independently. Both the modified Barthel Index and Spinal Cord Independence Measure scores showed significant improvement. The treatment plan adopted for this patient was swift, timely, and precisely targeted, leading to rapid improvements in mobility, sensory function, and activities of daily living in both lower limbs, thereby enabling a quicker recovery of professional and social activity abilities.",Medicine,2025,Nannan Yang; Qi Xiao; Tao Liu; Fuqin Zhang
40550090,Webbed skin of the posterior labial commissure: A rare cause of dyspareunia: A case report.,"Dyspareunia is a common disease affecting the physical and mental health of individuals. There are several reasons for dyspareunia. It is essential to identify the causes of dyspareunia and to implement targeted treatments. The patient was a 26-year-old married woman who presented with dyspareunia lasting for several months, and never successfully engaged in sexual intercourse. She had a webbed skin with a scar at the posterior labial commissure from the 5 o'clock position to the 7 o'clock position of the vaginal opening, partially blocking it. This case presented a rare cause of dyspareunia. In this case, we designed a five-flap method to extend the skin length of the vaginal opening and solved the problem of obscuration of the patient's vaginal opening. After surgery, the vaginal opening appeared normal, with an apparent increase in diameter, and the incision was recovered. In this case, we attempted a five-flap plasty on the webbed skin of the posterior labial commissure, and the outcome was satisfactory. This demonstrates the potential of this new treatment. This case report can help clinicians broaden their treatment options.",Medicine,2025,Shoujie Wang; Kai Xu; Banghui Shi; Zhikang Zhu; Jialun Shen; Xiaoling Chen
40550088,Clinical prediction of prognostic outcome of intravenous thrombolysis in mild stroke.,"Development and validation of an easy-to-visualize nomogram for acute mild ischemic stroke (MIS) with unfavorable outcome 3 months after application of alteplase intravenous thrombolysis. A retrospective cohort study analysis was conducted at the Baoding First Central Hospital, involving 461 patients diagnosed with acute MIS who received alteplase thrombolysis within the treatment time window. The LASSO regression technique was employed to identify significant variables and develop nomograms. The model's performance was assessed through area under curve-receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration plots, and decision curves, followed by a final evaluation of its validity. Five predictors that were found to be significantly associated with a 3-month adverse prognosis in patients who underwent intravenous thrombolysis for mild stroke were identified as door-to-needle time, homocysteine levels, brain natriuretic peptide, postthrombolysis National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (i.e., immediate postthrombolysis NIHSS score, postthrombolysis NIHSS score (P-NIHSS)), and the monocyte to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio. A visualization chart was constructed. The model had strong predictive performance, with an area under curve-receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.904 (95% confidence interval, 0.858-0.944) for the training cohort and 0.852 (95% confidence interval, 0.768-0.917) for the validation cohort. This straightforward predictive model efficiently identifies factors linked to unfavorable prognosis at the 3-month mark following intravenous thrombolytic therapy for acute MIS, thereby enhancing clinical practice and optimizing the distribution of social resources.",Medicine,2025,Chao Feng; Bing Dai; Mo Yang; Feifei Yu; Qing Liang; Yinglei Li; Tao Qie
40550079,Left atrial appendage occlusion procedure and antithrombotics: less may be enough for lower risk patients: A single-center observational study.,"Antithrombotic therapy following left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) is recommended to prevent device-induced thrombosis and stroke. Guidelines suggest oral anticoagulants and aspirin for the first 45 days and then dual antiplatelet therapy for 6 months. However, regimens for antithrombotic therapy varies widely. This study aimed to assess the characteristics of patients receiving minimal versus standard antithrombotic therapy post-LAAO, and to examine the association between treatment type and thrombotic/bleeding risk scores. We conducted a retrospective observational study of patients who underwent LAAO at a teaching hospital between April and December 2023. Patients were categorized into minimal (DOAC only) or standard (DOAC plus aspirin) therapy groups during the first 45 days, and into minimal (SAPT) or standard (DAPT) groups from 45 days to 6 months. Outcomes included CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores, comorbidities, and bleeding/thrombotic events. Statistical analyses included univariate and bivariate comparisons using Chi-square, Fisher exact test, and t-tests. Among 33 patients, 82% received minimal therapy and 18% for the standard therapy in the first 45 days. Standard therapy patients had higher rates of transient ischemic attack (50% vs 7.5%), stroke (100% vs 37%), coronary artery disease (100% vs 44.4%), and NSAID use (33.3% vs 3.7%, P < .05). The CHA2DS2-VASc scores were significantly higher in the standard group (6.5 ± 0.5 vs 4.6 ± 1.4, P = .002), with no difference in HAS-BLED scores. From 45 days to 6 months, 15.2% received minimal and 84.8% for the standard therapy, with no significant differences in scores. Patients with lower CHA2DS2-VASc scores were more likely to receive minimal therapy, indicating potential for risk-guided antithrombotic management post-LAAO. Further studies are needed to validate individualized treatment strategies.",Medicine,2025,Myung-Rho Kim; Jasmine Dugal; Shawn Wang; Spencer Taylor; Vidhani Goel; Amaan Shafi; Aditi Singh; Kavita Batra
40550070,The association between regional cerebral oxygen saturation and neurological outcomes in cardiac arrest survivors.,"Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) is recommended for monitoring cerebral perfusion status. We aimed to investigate the association between rSO2 and neurological outcomes and correlating parameters with rSO2 in cardiac arrest survivors. This observational study included adult comatose cardiac arrest survivors who underwent targeted temperature management and were monitored with rSO2 between June 2021 and February 2023. We collected rSO2 values monitored after admission to the intensive care unit at initial, last, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after return of spontaneous circulation. We calculated the minimum, maximum, and average rSO2 values. The primary outcome was the 6-month neurological outcome assessed using the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scale, dichotomized into good (CPC 1 or 2) or poor (CPC 3-5). Among the 78 included patients, 33.3% (26 patients) had poor neurological outcomes. The poor neurological outcome group exhibited lower maximum rSO2 (78.5 [70.0-86.8] vs 89.0 [78.3-95.00], P = .006) and lower last rSO2 (58.0 [45.3-71.8] vs 70.0 [56.2-85.3], P = .010). Initial, minimum, and average rSO2 did not differ between neurological outcome groups. The rSO2 significantly changed over 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after return of spontaneous circulation (P = .001). Maximum rSO2 (odds ratio [OR] 0.931; 95% confidence intervals [CIs] 0.885-0.980), last rSO2 during 72 hours (OR 0.950; 95% CIs 0.918-0.983) and rSO2 at 48 hours (OR 0.959; 95% CIs 0.920-0.998) were independently associated with poor neurological outcomes. Among hemoglobin, PCO2, PO2, and mean arterial pressure (MAP), hemoglobin correlated with rSO2 in both neurological outcomes, while MAP only showed an association with rSO2 in the poor neurological outcomes group (R = 0.292). Lower maximum, 48 hours, and last rSO2 values were associated with poor neurological outcomes. The rSO2 was dependent on MAP in patients with poor neurological outcomes.",Medicine,2025,Seok Jin Ryu; Byung Kook Lee; Dong Hun Lee; Dong Ki Kim; Yong Soo Cho; Ji Ho Lee; Jung Soo Park; Jin Hong Min; Yong Hun Jung; Kyung Woon Jeung
40550065,Anti-CASPR2 meningoencephalitis with thickened dura mater induced by various infections: A case report and literature review.,"With the update of novel autoantibodies and the expansion of the clinical spectrum, our understanding of autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is rapidly evolving. Anti-CASPR2 meningoencephalitis is a relatively rare condition that may be induced by infections. A young man presented with 3 episodes of meningoencephalitis potentially triggered by possible viral, Salmonella, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Neuroimaging revealed a thickening of the cerebral dura mater. Laboratory tests found positive serum CASPR2 antibodies in the third episode. Across all 3 episodes, similar clinical manifestations and imaging features were observed. Although autoantibodies in the previous 2 phases were negative, the possibility of infection-related anti-CASPR2 meningoencephalitis remains highly suspected. The treatment regimen comprised antimicrobial agents, corticosteroid therapy, intravenous immunoglobulin, and rituximab administration. Following treatment, the patient's condition improved with no recurrence to date. Repeat testing showed undetectable anti-CASPR2 immunoglobulin G in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Post-treatment contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the resolution of dural thickening. We further reviewed the mechanism of various infection-related AE and characteristics of CASPR2-related disease. To our knowledge, this is the first report of CASPR2 meningoencephalitis with thickened dura mater, indicating the importance of paying attention to antibody-negative AE and monitor antibodies repeatedly when necessary. In addition to immunotherapy, we recommend comprehensive management throughout the disease process.",Medicine,2025,Pan Gao; Xiaowu Chen; Yuhao Li; Fangming Li; Hongya Zhang
40550058,Cefotaxime-associated encephalopathy in peritoneal dialysis patients: A case report.,"Cefotaxime is a widely used 3rd-generation cephalosporin antibiotic that is primarily excreted through urine. Third-generation cephalosporins (e.g., ceftazidime, ceftriaxone) and the 4th-generation cefepime are associated with neurological complications. Although cephalosporin-associated encephalopathy (CAE) is well-documented, cases specifically induced by cefotaxime remain remarkably rare. To our knowledge, this is the 1st documented case of cefotaxime-induced CAE in a patient undergoing peritoneal dialysis. A 72-year-old female patient on peritoneal dialysis developed delirium and impaired consciousness 7 days after receiving cefotaxime as part of her anti-infective therapy for a pulmonary infection. The patient expressed concern regarding the onset of impaired consciousness and intermittent delirium as well as her prognosis and potential sequelae. This investigation focused on the potential role of cefotaxime in triggering CAE in peritoneal dialysis patients. The likelihood of cefotaxime causing drug reactions was confirmed using the Naranjo Scale score. Following the suspicion of cefotaxime-induced encephalopathy, the treatment regimen was modified, which included discontinuation of cefotaxime, initiation of intravenous piperacillin/bactam as an alternative antibiotic therapy, and symptomatic treatment with olanzapine. Close monitoring and adjustments to the peritoneal dialysis regimen are essential for managing neurological symptoms. After discontinuation of cefotaxime and appropriate adjustments to the treatment regimen, the patient's clinical condition gradually improved. Symptoms of delirium subsided, consciousness returned to normal, and laboratory indicators stabilized. This case emphasizes the importance of considering the potential adverse effects of antibiotics, particularly in patients with kidney insufficiency undergoing dialysis. This highlights the necessity of vigilance in monitoring drug-related complications for timely detection of encephalopathic symptoms and development of individualized treatment strategies. We acknowledge that cefotaxime may increase the risk of CAE in patients on peritoneal dialysis, necessitating heightened awareness among physicians.",Medicine,2025,Gao Song; Rong Li; Na Yang; Meng-Qun Cheng; Cai-Qiong Zhang
40550045,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases: A Mendelian randomization study.,"In this study, we used the Mendelian randomization (MR) method to systematically examine whether there is a bidirectional causal relationship between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). We analyzed data from 6,44,924 participants using MR to evaluate causality. We employed inverse variance weighted and MR-Egger regression tests for MR analysis. Additionally, we performed sensitivity analyses using the MR-Egger test and Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier. The inverse variance weighted analysis found no evidence of a risk effect between ALS and the neurodegenerative diseases AD, PD, FTD, MSA, and DLB. However, the MR-Egger analysis showed that both AD (odds ratio: 1.079, 95% confidence interval: 1.017-1.145, P = .029) and PD (odds ratio: 1.210, 95% confidence interval: 1.046-1.401, P = .020) have a risk effect on ALS, indicating that AD and PD increase the risk of ALS. Our MR analysis suggests that AD and PD may have a potential causal relationship with ALS. Conversely, ALS does not appear to have a causal relationship with the other neurodegenerative diseases examined (FTD, MSA, DLB).",Medicine,2025,Chaofang Lei; Jiaxu Chen; Zhigang Chen; Yonghong Xiao; Jianbei Chen; Chongyang Ma; Miaomiao Yang; Dahua Wu; Le Xie

40550038,Functional ambulation recovery in MCA stroke survivors: Predictive role of cognitive function and extremely low alanine aminotransferase levels: A retrospective observational study.,"Stroke is a leading cause of disability, significantly impacting mobility. Effective rehabilitation depends on accurate predictors of recovery. Recent studies suggest that both cognitive function and certain initial laboratory biomarkers, such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), could be crucial for predicting recovery outcomes. This study investigates how cognitive function and ALT levels can predict functional ambulation in survivors of middle cerebral artery stroke. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 87 patients who began rehabilitation within 30 days of their first middle cerebral artery stroke. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to identify predictors of ambulation recovery. The variables assessed included age, sex, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Berg Balance Scale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and extremely low ALT levels. Multivariate binary logistic regression revealed that female sex, lower Mini-Mental State Examination and Berg Balance Scale scores, and extremely low ALT levels were associated with poorer odds of achieving functional ambulation. This research underscores the critical role of integrating cognitive assessments and routine biomarkers into rehabilitation practices to enhance prognostic accuracy and personalize rehabilitation strategies. The findings highlight the need for further investigation to confirm these results and explore the underlying mechanisms, with the aim of advancing individualized rehabilitation approaches and improving patient outcomes.",Medicine,2025,Hyeonwoo Jeon; Namo Jeon; Minsong Kim; Mingu Kang; Suebeen Kim; Doo Young Kim

Significant progress was observed in blood-brain barrier disruption techniques and the development of molecular probes, especially those targeting IDH and MGMT mutations. Molecular imaging has been pivotal in advancing glioma research, contributing to improved diagnostic accuracy and personalized treatment strategies. However, challenges such as clinical translation and standardization remain. Future studies should focus on integrating advanced technologies into routine clinical practice to enhance patient care.",Medicine,2025,Hui Zhou; Yilin Luo; Shiguang Li; Guoping Zhang; Xianchun Zeng
40550024,Usefulness of digital infrared thermography video using FLIR T560 in detecting hypothermia associated with complex regional pain syndrome type I: A CARE-compliant case report.,"Because the diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) majorly relies on patients' subjective clinical complaints, CRPS can be overdiagnosed, underdiagnosed, or missed entirely in clinical practice. CRPS is related to dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, which causes temperature changes in patients' skin. This case report evaluates the effectiveness of the FLIR T560 portable thermal imaging camera in detecting hypothermia associated with CRPS type I, potentially enhancing diagnostic accuracy. We present a 25-year-old female with pain and limited passive range of motion in all parts of her hands bilaterally for 7 months. The bilateral hand pain was aggravated by active and passive range of motion. Also, the patient had bilateral hyperesthesia and allodynia of her entire hands, and skin atrophy and hypohidrosis were observed on both hands. The skin color of both hands was relatively cyanotic. Stiffness was checked during the passive range of motion of her bilateral fingers. Additionally, mild motor weakness was checked on the finger flexor and extensor bilaterally. The patient was diagnosed with CRPS type I. The FLIR T560 was used to record thermal images in an insulated room, revealing a lower surface temperature (approximately 1°C-2°C difference), shown as less bright, on her bilateral hands and forearms compared with a normal subject. We administered Pregabalin 50 mg oral medication twice daily and the contrast bath. At 1-month-follow up, about 50% of her pain was reduced. We demonstrate that the FLIR T560 thermal imaging camera can show hypothermia on the hands bilaterally in CRPS type I, which can be helpful for the accurate diagnosis of CRPS. The FLIR T560 camera is a portable and convenient tool that may support the diagnosis of CRPS.",Medicine,2025,Yewon Jang; Sungho Kim; Min Cheol Chang
40549994,Pearls & Oy-sters: Arterial Wall Enhancements and Rapid Clinical Progression in Noninflammatory Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy.,"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a common cause of lobar intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and cognitive impairment for which diagnostic criteria have been recently revised. A subset of CAA cases have superimposed inflammation in the form of CAA-related inflammation, which may result in a more severe clinical course. We present the case of a 61-year-old man who presented with subacute behavioral changes, motor aphasia, and right hemiparesis due to an ICH in the left superior frontal gyrus. Brain MRI revealed a small chronic cortico-subcortical right occipital hemorrhage and multiple lobar microbleeds, fulfilling the criteria for probable CAA. One year later, he developed acute psychosis with aggressive behavior. β-Amyloid (Aβ) 1-40 and 1-42 levels were reduced in the CSF, with normal total tau and phosphorylated tau. He remained clinically stable during the following years. At age 68, he showed a rapid cognitive deterioration over 6 months, atypical for CAA. Repeat brain MRI showed multiple cortico-subcortical microbleeds and microinfarctions. High-resolution vessel wall MRI showed concentric wall enhancement in multiple arterial segments. These findings raised concerns for an inflammatory process, in the form of either inflammatory CAA or vasculitis. The neuropathologic findings were consistent with severe CAA without vessel wall inflammation. This case highlights the periods of steep progression that may occur in CAA and that Aβ accumulation alone, without inflammation, may be associated with arterial wall enhancement, mimicking a vasculitic or amyloid-related inflammatory process. The value of this neuroimaging feature for patient stratification or prognosis requires further validation.",Neurology,2025,João Moura; Vasco Abreu; João Pedro Filipe; Ricardo Taipa; Luís F Maia
40549993,Sudden Prehospital Deaths From Brain Arteriovenous Malformations: A Population-Based Study.,"The number of unexpected prehospital deaths from brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is unknown because existing mortality data are derived from hospital-based cohorts. In this study, we aimed to determine the rate and causes of AVM-related deaths in a large population-based cohort, both in and outside hospitals. We hypothesized that AVMs infrequently cause unexpected prehospital deaths, and when they do, it is typically due to hemorrhages rather than epileptic seizures. In this population-based cross-sectional study, we examined the AVM-related deaths within the Helsinki University Hospital (HUH) region during 1998-2015, including both diagnosed patients and undiagnosed individuals with prehospital deaths identified at autopsy. Autopsies are legally mandatory in Finland for all unexpected and sudden deaths. Prehospital deaths were identified through autopsy reports, which were obtained from the National Cause of Death Register (using the ICD-10 codes I60.8, I61.0-I61.9, or Q28.0-Q28.3), and the patients who were already diagnosed were identified from the Helsinki AVM Register. Age-standardized detection rates were calculated using the 2013 European Standard Population (ESP)-derived age-specific weights, with 95% CIs derived from the normal approximation of binomial distribution. Between 1998 and 2015, we identified 4 unexpected prehospital AVM deaths in undiagnosed individuals (median age 41 years, 50% female) in the HUH region from the National Cause of Death Register data. For the same period, the HUH AVM database revealed 284 newly diagnosed patients with AVM (mean age at diagnosis 41.1 years [SD 18.0 years], 48% female). Altogether, there were 6 AVM-related prehospital deaths, 2 in previously diagnosed patients. Four of the 6 prehospital deaths were caused by AVM-related epileptic seizures and 2 by AVM hemorrhage. Among individuals experiencing their first AVM-related hemorrhage (n = 168), 1.2% experienced prehospital deaths due to hemorrhage. Similarly, of those diagnosed with AVM-related epileptic seizures (n = 69), 5.8% experienced prehospital deaths from seizures. For people with unruptured and ruptured AVMs, 6-month case fatality rates (CIs) from detection were 5.8% (1.7%-10.8%) and 11.9% (7.1%-17.3%), respectively. The crude and ESP-standardized detection rates of AVMs (including prehospital deaths) were 0.80 (0.71-0.89) and 0.78 (0.69-0.87) per 100,000 person-years. AVM-related prehospital deaths are rare and often caused by epileptic seizures. Most AVM-related deaths occur in hospitals.",Neurology,2025,Anni Pohjola; Aleksanteri Asikainen; Jaakko Kaprio; Ilari Matias Rautalin; Mika Niemelä; Aki Laakso; Miikka Korja
40549991,Clinical Reasoning: A 60-Year-Old Man With Rapidly Progressive Left Hemibody Weakness and Vision Loss.,"A 60-year-old man presented with 2 weeks of progressive left-sided weakness, dysarthria, and an incongruous left homonymous hemianopsia, with MRI brain showing a lesion involving the right cerebral peduncle, optic radiation, and dorsal midbrain. Serum and CSF testing was largely unremarkable. His weakness worsened rapidly, and short-interval repeat imaging demonstrated expansion of the brainstem abnormality. A methodical investigation of inflammatory, infectious, neoplastic, and paraneoplastic causes ultimately yielded the diagnosis. This case provides a comprehensive differential for atypical brainstem lesions, which can pose a diagnostic dilemma, particularly when CSF studies are unrevealing and the location is not amenable to biopsy. In such situations, a systematic approach, including whole-body imaging, can aid in diagnosis.",Neurology,2025,Matthew Rock; Shannon C Shipley; Jessica N Little; Joseph R Berger; Denise J Xu
40549967,"Relationship Between Stroke Knowledge, Health Information Literacy, and Health Self- Management Among Patients with Stroke: Multicenter Cross-Sectional Study.","The World Health Organization highlights the essential role of effective self-management in the prevention and control of chronic diseases, noting that proper self-management can significantly slow disease progression. Stroke, which ranks as the third leading cause of death worldwide, is often accompanied by inadequate self-management among patients. While health information literacy (HIL) has been shown to influence self-management in conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, its role as a mediating factor linking disease perception and health behavior in patients with stroke remains insufficiently explored. Addressing this research gap is vital for developing targeted interventions. The aim of this study was to investigate the current status of HIL, stroke knowledge, and self-management abilities among patients with stroke in Southwest China. Additionally, the study analyzed the relationships among these three factors and their mechanisms of action, providing evidence to inform the development of effective health education strategies for enhancing self-management in patients with stroke. A multicenter cross-sectional design was employed, enrolling 514 patients with stroke from the neurology departments of three tertiary general hospitals in Chengdu between September 2022 and March 2023. Data collection used a standardized set of scales: the health information literacy questionnaire for stroke assessed HIL, the stroke prevention questionnaire evaluated knowledge levels, and the stroke self-management assessment scale measured self-management abilities. Regression analysis and bootstrap mediation effect testing were conducted using SPSS software (version 26.0). Patients with stroke had a mean (SD) score of 17.61 (6.46) for stroke knowledge, 61.17 (13.58) for HIL, and 158.70 (19.07) for self-management skills. Correlation analysis indicated a positive correlation of stroke knowledge with both self-management (r=0.668; P<.001) and HIL (r=0.138; P<.001). The mediation test showed a significant mediating effect of HIL between stroke knowledge and self-management (β=0.543; 95% CI: 0.431-0.663), with an effect share of 82.77%. There is a correlation between HIL and self-management; the higher the HIL, the better is the self-management behavior. Furthermore, HIL partially mediates the effect of stroke knowledge on self-management.",JMIR medical informatics,2025,Mengxue Zeng; Yanhua Liu; Ying He; Wenxia Huang
40549959,"Trajectory of internet gaming disorder among Chinese adolescents: Course, predictors, and long-term mental health outcomes.","Internet gaming disorder (IGD) is a growing public health concern, especially among adolescents. However, most IGD studies are cross-sectional, leaving its developmental course poorly understood. This study examined IGD trajectories, their predictors, and their long-term mental health outcomes among Chinese adolescents. A cohort of 16,833 adolescent gamers (mean age = 13.40, 46.56% girls) was recruited from 76 middle schools in Zigong City through cluster sampling. Assessments were conducted in November 2020 (T1), November 2021 (T2), and November 2022 (T3). IGD was measured using the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale-Short Form (IGDS9-SF). Demographic, gaming, environmental, and psychological factors (e.g., depression, anxiety, sleep problems, suicidal ideation, conduct problems, hyperactivity, resilience, mental wellbeing, prosocial behavior) were also assessed. Growth mixture modeling (GMM) identified IGD trajectories, and logistic regression evaluated predictors and mental health outcomes at T3. GMM identified four IGD trajectories: High-Risk Decreasing (4.5%), Moderate-Risk Stable (19.5%), Moderate-Risk Increasing (3.0%), and Low-Risk Stable (73.0%). Age, gaming time, anxiety, sleep problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, and low prosocial behavior predicted worsening IGD symptoms. At T3, the Moderate-Risk Increasing group had significantly higher risks for adverse mental health outcomes compared to the Low-Risk Stable group, whereas the High-Risk Decreasing group showed no significant or minimal differences in most domains from the Low-Risk Stable group after adjusting for baseline characteristics. These findings underscore the heterogeneous nature of IGD development and highlight the need for long-term monitoring and tailored interventions to mitigate adverse mental health outcomes in at-risk adolescents.",Journal of behavioral addictions,2025,Pu Peng; Zhangming Chen; Silan Ren; Ying He; Jinguang Li; Aijun Liao; Linlin Zhao; Xu Shao; Shanshan Chen; Ruini He; Yudiao Liang; Youguo Tan; Xiaogang Chen; Jinsong Tang; Yanhui Liao
40549955,Evolving diagnosis and comorbidities of gaming disorder: Insights from psychiatry departments in five Chinese hospitals from 2018 to 2023.,"The 11th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) recognizes gaming disorder (GD) as a behavioral addiction, but its implications for the clinical diagnostic practice of GD remain underexplored. This study examines the clinical diagnosis of GD since its inclusion in ICD-11 to understand trends in diagnosis rates in psychiatric departments and patient characteristics, particularly comorbidities. This multicenter, retrospective observational study was conducted in five large tertiary hospitals and mental health centers across four Chinese provinces. Diagnoses of GD in each hospital were based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) or ICD-11 criteria. Data were extracted from hospital records, including demographics, diagnoses, and medical history. Of the 7,877,415 total visitors, 3,517 unique patients (0.045%) met GD diagnostic criteria. GD diagnoses showed a significant linear increase (χ2 = 83.143, p < 0.001) from 2018 to 2023. 37.59% of GD patients had comorbidities, mostly mood disorders, followed by impulse control disorders, schizophrenia or other primary psychotic disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Patients were younger (F = 48.69, p < 0.001), mainly aged 12-18. This study reveals an upward trend in GD diagnosis from 2018 to 2023, showing a trend toward younger diagnosis age, especially in males. Notably, there's a high rate of comorbidities, with mood disorders being the most common. While ICD-11 may have improved GD identification, further research is needed to clarify whether the increased rates are due to higher prevalence or better recognition.",Journal of behavioral addictions,2025,Xuhao Wang; Shuhong Lin; Xuebing Liu; Shucai Huang; Jing Qi; Tianli Shao; Zhenjiang Liao; Xinxin Chen; Yifan Li; Ying Tang; Hongxian Shen; Qiuping Huang
40549949,Individual-specific subspace of altered functional connectivity predicts clinical symptoms in Internet gaming disorder.,"Despite extensive research efforts aimed at unraveling the neural mechanisms underlying Internet gaming disorder (IGD), reproducibility remains a challenge, largely due to overlooking the clinical and biological diversity within individuals affected by IGD. Therefore, investigating the altered brain features associated with IGD within both individual-shared and individual-specific subspaces is crucial for understanding this complex and heterogeneous disorder. This study included 555 participants, comprising 326 individuals with IGD and 229 recreational game users (RGUs). Firstly, we computed altered functional connectivity (AFC) matrices for individuals with IGD and compared them with those of RGUs. Subsequently, we applied the common orthogonal basis extraction algorithm to partition the AFC of individuals with IGD into individual-shared and individual-specific subspaces. Finally, we examined brain regions exhibiting generally abnormal patterns in the individual-shared subspace and employed multiple linear regression analysis to assess the predictive influence of AFC within the individual-specific subspace on clinical symptoms. Our findings revealed individual-shared altered patterns in the visual network, medial frontal network (MFN), and frontoparietal network (FPN) among individuals with IGD, which are associated with executive control and visual processing. Within the individual-specific subspace, we observed that AFC within the default mode network could predict scores related to fun-seeking behavior in the behavioral activation system (BAS), while AFC within the MFN correlated with reward responsiveness and drive scores in the BAS. Additionally, AFC within the FPN was predictive of scores in the behavioral inhibition system. This study successfully decomposed the AFC of IGD into individual-shared and individual-specific subspaces. The AFC within individual-specific subspaces holds promise as potential biomarkers for elucidating clinical symptoms in IGD, thereby offering an analytical framework for investigating heterogeneity in other addictive behaviors.",Journal of behavioral addictions,2025,Shuang Li; Anhang Jiang; Min Wang; Haosen Ni; Jiejie Fu; Guangheng Dong
40549926,Prognostic Features of Pediatric Primary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis With CNS Involvement.,"In this study, we analyzed genetic variation and prognostic factors in pediatric primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (pHLH) with central nervous system (CNS) involvement, based on data from patients treated at Beijing Children's Hospital between September 2017 and September 2022. A total of 67 pHLH patients were included, with a median age of 4.3 years. Our findings revealed distinct genetic mutation distributions between CNS-pHLH and pHLH without CNS involvement; specifically, CNS-pHLH patients had significantly fewer XIAP mutations but more PRF1 mutations (P=0.006 and 0.002, respectively). In addition, the 3-year overall survival (OS) rate for CNS-pHLH patients was markedly lower compared with those without CNS involvement (50.2%±18.42% vs. 93.3%±9.02%, P<0.001). Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was strongly associated with better prognosis in CNS-pHLH patients, yielding a 3-year OS of 82.0%±23.91% in transplanted patients, significantly higher than the 28.6%±19.40% in nontransplanted patients (P<0.001). Furthermore, a Cox regression analysis identified PRF1 mutation, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) soluble CD25 levels above 280 pg/mL, and elevated ferritin levels as independent risk factors for poor 3-year event-free survival (EFS) in CNS-pHLH (P<0.05). These findings suggest that pHLH patients with PRF1 mutations should undergo regular CNS monitoring to prevent disease progression, and that HSCT may improve long-term prognosis in CNS-pHLH cases.",Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,2025,Chenzi Zhao; Qing Zhang; Haoyue Jia; Sitong Chen; Liping Zhang; Rui Zhang; Zhigang Li
40549903,Immune cell profiling reveals diverse niches of immune residents of the enteric nervous system and potential neuroimmune interactions.,"Gastrointestinal (GI) neuroimmune interactions are crucial sensors and regulators of tissue homeostasis. Most enteric neurons reside within the myenteric plexus of the enteric nervous system in the muscular region, forming a structure called the <i>muscularis externa</i>. Despite established interactions between muscularis macrophages and neurons, the presence and function of other immune cell types remains poorly characterized. Here, we mapped the muscularis immune cell landscape, revealing that diverse cell types are present within distinct locations of the GI tract, and they lie in proximity to neuronal cell bodies and their axons. Using a hypothesis-free computational approach, we identify putative ligand-receptor interactions from publicly available single-cell RNA datasets and further validate one of these (App-CD74). This study provides a valuable reference to encourage new avenues of research underpinning enteric neuroimmune interactions as key contributors to GI homeostasis and diseases.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2025,Haozhe Wang; Aidil Zaini; Bailey Cardwell; Matthew C Rowe; Alana Butler; Connie H Y Wong; Daniel P Poole; Benjamin Marsland; Joel C Bornstein; Nicola L Harris
40549842,COSMOS: Interrater and Intrarater Reliability Study of a Novel Outcome Measure.,"The vast majority of patients with minor stroke achieve what are considered good or excellent outcomes on the modified Rankin Scale (0-1/0-2), yet many are dissatisfied with their outcomes. There is a need for a functional outcome measure tailored for minor stroke that better reflects the spectrum of clinical outcomes within this population. We developed the Canadian Outcome Scale for Minor Stroke (COSMOS) and performed an interrater and intrarater reliability study. COSMOS is a 7-point scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (loss of independence for an instrumental or basic activity of daily living or worse), which accounts for performance limitations and losses of a person's hobbies or passions and of their employment, educational, service, or caregiving pursuits, besides just activities of daily living. One hundred test case vignettes were developed. Stroke physicians, fellows, and research nurses/staff were invited to review training materials and provide the COSMOS grade for 20 cases representing all COSMOS grades (0-6). After a minimum 2 weeks' wash-out period, participants were asked to grade the same 20 cases again. Interrater and intrarater agreement were assessed using Cohen κ, weighted κ, percentage agreement, and intraclass correlation coefficient. Among 33 participants (18 attending physicians, 9 stroke fellows, and 6 research staff/nurses; median 12.5 years of experience), COSMOS had substantial interrater reliability (80.5% agreement [95% CI, 75.7%-85.3%]; Cohen κ, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.72-0.84]) and almost-perfect intrarater reliability overall (87.1% agreement [95% CI, 84.4%-89.7%]; Cohen κ, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.82-0.88]); weighted κ showed almost perfect agreement for both interrater (0.88 [95% CI, 0.85-0.92]) and intrarater reliability (0.92 [95% CI, 0.90-0.94]). The overall chance-adjusted simultaneous intrarater/interrater agreement using intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.94-0.97). Results were similar with substantial to almost-perfect agreement when considering key subgroups based on position (attendings, fellows, research nurses/staff) and years of experience. In conclusion, the newly proposed COSMOS scale demonstrated substantial interrater and intrarater reliability. The scale merits further study in cohort studies and clinical trials of minor stroke.",Stroke,2025,Mayank Goyal; Aravind Ganesh; Salome L Bosshart; Alexander Stebner; Nishita Singh; Bijoy K Menon; Shelagh B Coutts; Johanna M Ospel; Mohammed A Almekhlafi; Julie Kromm; Philippe Couillard; Dar Dowlatshahi; Brian H Buck; Brian van Adel; Karla J Ryckborst; Anurag Trivedi; Chrysi Bogiatzi; Alexandre Y Poppe; Mohamad Mehdi; Luciana Catanese; Ruth Whelan; Robert Fahed; Brindan Sivanandan; Mohamed A AlShamrani; Sachin M Mishra; Umberto Pensato; Ben Agnelli; Arun Kathuveetil; Ivy A Sebastian; Aleksander Tkach; Katrina H D Ignacio; Miranda Wan; Susan Alcock; Rick H Swartz; Genoveva Maclean; Stacey Greco; Carol Kenney; Andrew M Demchuk; Michael D Hill
40549839,Fifty Years of Deciphering Stroke Pathophysiology.,"In the 2025 David G. Sherman Lecture, Jean-Claude Baron emphasizes the major role positron emission tomography played in the breakthroughs in ischemic stroke pathophysiology that took place in the last half-century and allowed major therapeutic advances. Based on his work using PET in both animal models and people with stroke spanning 4 decades, he details his main contributions to key milestones, including (1) the demonstration of the hemodynamic consequences of chronic carotid artery occlusion and the hemodynamic mechanism underlying some transient ischemic attacks; (2) the documentation of the existence of the ischemic penumbra in man and the formal validation, using stringent prespecified operational criteria, of the core/penumbra model; (3) the persistence of substantial penumbral volumes up to 17 hours after stroke onset in a substantial fraction of patients; (4) the demonstration that from early timepoints poststroke, a good fraction of patients do not show the extensive penumbral pattern but instead exhibit large cores or spontaneously reperfusion, indicating the importance of individual patient selection for trials and therapy based on physiological imaging instead of time since stroke onset; (5) the documentation that the salvaged penumbra may not be intact but is often affected by selective neuronal loss, which may impact functional outcome and represent a novel target for neuroprotection; and (6) the demonstration of remote metabolic effects of disconnection resulting in loss of excitatory input, such as crossed cerebellar diaschisis and thalamocortical diaschisis, which may represent additional targets for therapies aiming at adaptive plasticity.",Stroke,2025,Jean-Claude Baron
40549834,Poverty and Stroke: The Need for Socioeconomic Data in Hyperacute Care.,"Poverty profoundly influences stroke risk, access to care, and recovery, yet remains largely invisible in hyperacute stroke trials. Despite growing awareness of health inequities, current research and clinical frameworks rarely capture socioeconomic data at the point of care-particularly during the hyperacute phase, when decisions are time sensitive. This commentary highlights the urgent need to incorporate measures of poverty and social vulnerability into hyperacute stroke care and research. We briefly review existing evidence on the relationship between socioeconomic status and acute stroke outcomes, identify gaps in current data collection practices, and explore why capturing such information has remained a challenge. To address this gap, we propose a practical, rapid-assessment approach using brief, validated tools to measure economic strain in emergency or prehospital settings. These tools can be embedded into clinical workflows with minimal disruption while providing critical context for interpreting outcomes and guiding resource allocation. We envision incorporating such tools into future randomized controlled trials to ensure that socioeconomic factors are systematically captured and analyzed-ultimately enabling more inclusive trial designs, equitable care delivery, and data-driven policy change.",Stroke,2025,Mayank Goyal; Michael D Hill; Jeffery L Saver; Nishita Singh
40549831,Does pneumonia increase the risk of dementia and cognitive decline? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The link between pneumonia and elevated risk of dementia and cognitive decline is still unclear. This study aims to evaluate the link between pneumonia and the subsequent risk of developing dementia. MEDLINE (<i>via</i> PubMed), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica Database), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) databases were searched for studies, published up to 29 February 2024. Eligible studies provided data on adult patients diagnosed with pneumonia and reported outcomes related to dementia or cognitive decline. Quality of observational studies was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using random-effects models. Subgroup analyses were done based on age, geography, study design and pneumonia type. Ten studies were included, encompassing a diverse population sample. Pooled analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between pneumonia and increased risk of dementia (HR = 1.738; 95% CI: 1.358 to 2.225), with substantial heterogeneity across the studies (I<sup>2</sup> = 97.1%). Subgroup analysis indicated that the association was more pronounced in older adults and varied slightly by region and study design. The risk did not significantly differ between bacterial and non-specific pneumonia types. This meta-analysis suggests that pneumonia is associated with a significantly higher risk of developing dementia. These findings underscore the need for diligent monitoring and preventive strategies for patients recovering from pneumonia, particularly among the elderly, to mitigate potential cognitive decline.PROSPERO registration number: CRD42024520631.",Annals of medicine,2025,Zhen Yan; Min Zhang; Lifang Yu; Fulian Zhang
40549812,The test-retest reliability of the H-Reflex and swaymeter in women aged 30-65 years.,"The H-reflex can objectively assess sensorimotor integration relevant to proprioception and postural control. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common and potentially dose-limiting side effect among breast cancer patients undergoing taxane-based treatments, leading to proprioception loss and balance issues, and an increased risk of falling. This study evaluated the between-day test-retest reliability of neurophysiological measures and postural sway, measured via swaymeter in a demographically similar population to those affected by breast cancer. 25 women aged 30-65 years were assessed on two occasions, approximately two weeks apart. The study measured between-day test-retest reliability of the soleus H-reflex and M-wave and postural sway, measured by the swaymeter. The soleus maximum H-reflex amplitude (Hmax) and maximum M-wave amplitude (Mmax) exhibited good to excellent (ICC = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.82-0.96) and moderate to excellent (ICC = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.62-0.91) between-day reliability, respectively. The Hmax/Mmax showed poor to good between-day reliability (ICC = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.31-0.82), and H-reflex latency demonstrated moderate to excellent between-day reliability (ICC = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.65-0.92). The between-day test-retest reliability of anteroposterior (AP) displacement and total sway across the two testing sessions was poor to moderate (ICC = 0.37, 95% CI: -0.03-0.66 and ICC = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.04-0.70, respectively). H-reflex and M-wave measures are reliable for between-day assessments. However, sway measures via swaymeter were less reliable, indicating a need for more robust tools to evaluate balance.",PloS one,2025,Rosiered Brownson-Smith; Jack Carr; Kai T Fox; Samuel T Orange; Nicola Cresti; John Saxton; John Temesi
40549788,"Randomized, Triple-Blind, and Parallel-Controlled Trial of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation for Cognitive Rehabilitation after Stroke.","Right hemisphere stroke frequently results in hemispatial neglect, a disabling condition that can significantly impede the recovery process. The chronic presence of neglect has been linked to poorer outcomes in both cognitive and motor domains. As an adjunct to conventional neuropsychological interventions, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)-a noninvasive technique that modulates neural excitability through low-intensity electrical currents-has gained attention for its potential to enhance cortical plasticity and support functional improvement in affected individuals. In this study, we propose a combined intervention protocol aimed at reducing symptoms of post-stroke hemispatial neglect. It consists of a cathodal tDCS protocol combined with a computerized neuropsychological rehabilitation program specifically designed for the rehabilitation of hemispatial neglect. The neuromodulation strategy is to reduce the hyperactivation of the undamaged hemisphere based on the interhemispheric rivalry model. The intervention consists of 2 weeks, 10 sessions (from Monday to Friday), 45 min each, of tDCS and conventional cognitive stimulation concurrently applied. The tDCS is applied by an 8-channel high definitiontDCS (HD- tDCS) device for 20 min and at 2 mA of intensity. The cathode is positioned over the left posterior parietal cortex (P3 following 10/20 system for electroencephalogram [EEG] electrode placement), and return electrodes are placed at C3, CP5, CP1, Pz, PO3, PO7, and P7. A neuropsychological and functional assessment was carried out at baseline and after the end of the intervention. The primary aim of the present study is to describe the protocol for a parallel, randomized, triple-blind experimental design. To ensure the feasibility of the protocol and its potential efficacy, a comprehensive description of the procedures applied to a single pilot participant is provided. Incorporating tDCS neuromodulation strategies into cognitive rehabilitation processes may lead to shortened intervention times and improve the functional status and quality of life of patients.",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2025,Begoña González Rodríguez; Elena M Marrón; Marcos Ríos-Lago; Aida Arroyo Ferrer; Yeray González-Zamorano; Francisco José Sánchez Cuesta; David De Noreña; Juan Pablo Romero
40549786,"Effects of pressure garments of varying designs on upper extremity sensorimotor functions and quality of life after stroke: Study protocol for a multicenter, double-blind, prospective randomized controlled trial.","Stroke often results in extensive neurological damage, leading to a wide range of rehabilitation needs and challenges, with upper extremity dysfunction being particularly prevalent. Although pressure garments have been used in the rehabilitation of children with cerebral palsy to reduce muscle tone, their therapeutic effects have not been thoroughly investigated in the field of stroke. To determine the effects of pressure garments with varying designs on stroke patients' sensorimotor function and quality of life. A total of 165 participants is required (55/group) with an effect size of 0.125, power of 0.80, alpha level of 0.05, and adjusted for a dropout rate of 20%. This is a multicenter, double-blind, prospective randomized controlled, three-group trial. At three hospitals in Shandong, China, 165 patients within 1-12 months of stroke are randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive Dorsal-Double-layered 10% circumferential reduction (DD-10, intervention), Single-layered 10% circumferential reduction (S-10, intervention), or Single-layered 0% circumferential reduction (S-0, placebo) pressure garments. Pressure garments are worn for 3 hours in the morning, 3 hours in the afternoon, and 8 hours at night daily for 8 weeks. During the first 4 weeks, patients also receive 30-min occupational therapy sessions. The primary outcome is the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity to assess motor control. Secondary outcomes are the Box and Block Test (BBT) for assessing dexterity, Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) for assessing muscle tone, Visual Analogue Scale for assessing pain, Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) for assessing self-perceived upper extremity function, and 36 Item Short Health Survey (SF-36) for assessing quality of life. Measurements are taken at Time 1(Baseline), Time 2 (Week 4), and Time 3 (Week 8). The expected outcome of this study is that it can determine the design of pressure garments best suited to improve sensorimotor function and the quality of life of stroke patients. It can also extend the clinical value of pressure garments and help healthcare professionals make more targeted treatment choices for stroke patients.

Surgery remains the only effective and widely accepted treatment; early diagnosis and intervention can significantly prevent blindness. Hence,Understanding the current epidemiological status of cataract is crucial for formulating better healthcare policies and effectively preventing blindness due to cataract. This study utilizes Global burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 data to conduct an in-depth analysis of the burden of cataract from 1990 to 2021, including gender disparities, risk factors, and the relationship between Socio-Demographic index (SDI) and disease burden. Additionally, we performed a frontier analysis of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) due to cataract from 1990 to 2021. Finally, we used the BAPC model to project the burden of cataract by gender from 2022 to 2030. The study revealed that the global burden of cataract remains significant. Worldwide, the Estimate Annual Percentage Change (EAPC) for cataract prevalence was 0.2117([95% CI] 0.1172-0.3063); the EAPC for cataract DALYs is -0.4798([95%CI] -0.5766--0.3828). Predominantly affecting females, individuals aged 50 and older, and those in medium-low and low SDI regions. Furthermore, the Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort (BAPC) model forecast a gradual decline in the global burden of cataract over the next nine years. This study utilized GBD 2021 to provide an in-depth analysis of the current global disease burden of cataracts. The results showed that although the Age-Standardized Rate (ASR) of DALYs decreased, the overall cataract Number still showed an increasing trend from 1990 to 2021 and 2022-2030.",PloS one,2025,Lixia Lin; Yongshun Liang; Guiyang Jiang; Qingqiao Gan; Tianqi Yang; Peipei Liao; Hao Liang
40549740,"Disability-adjusted life years, years lived with disability, and years of life lost of diseases among children and adolescents in national and subnational levels of Iran, 1990-2021: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease 2021.","The global burden of disease (GBD) is a helpful measure that provides estimations regarding the effect of diseases and injuries on public health. This evidence is vital for making health policies and assessing the progress toward global health targets. Specifically, the burden of disease in children and adolescents can have a massive impact on a society's health status. In this study, we aim to investigate the trends in years of life lost (YLL), years lost to disability (YLD), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in children and adolescents under the age of 20 in Iran, based on GBD 2021 data. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) classifies all causes of death and disability into four levels. Level 1 includes three main categories: communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases (CMNNDs), non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and injuries. Level 2 expands these categories into 22 clusters of causes. This study provides a descriptive analysis of the trends in YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs at levels 1 and 2 of the GBD hierarchy, focusing on children and adolescents under the age of 20 in Iran and its 31 provinces from 1990 to 2021. All metrics show an overall decline. DALYs rate from all causes decreased by 79.8%, YLDs by 6.2%, and YLLs rate by 89.3%. This reduction was consistent across all metrics of CMNNDs, NCDs, and injuries, with the exception of YLD for NCDs, which showed a rise between 1990 and 2021; from 3733.4 (2742.7 to 5013.2) to 4036.1 (2941.5 to 5436.5) per 100,000 population. Mental disorders have significantly contributed to the upward trend of NCDs. NCDs, with a rate of 5666.2 per 100,000 population, exhibited the highest DALY rate in Iran in 2021. The trend of DALYs, YLLs, and YLDs of injuries and CMNNDs in Iran has been mostly downward. Differences between provinces have declined over thirty years. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been changes in the trend of several diseases, especially the rise of mental disorders, respiratory infections and tuberculosis. Despite the overall decline in DALYs, YLLs, and YLDs for most causes of death, there has been an increase in YLDs from NCDs, underscoring the importance of addressing this issue. Reviewing YLLs to YLDs ratios for various diseases and injuries, combined with economic analyses of the cost-effectiveness of various health interventions, yields comprehensive evidence for health policy making.",PloS one,2025,Bahareh Gholami; Mohammad-Mahdi Bastan; Samira Gholami; Azar Nejati; Sepehr Khosravi; Mohammad-Reza Malekpour; Nazila Rezaei; Sarvenaz Shahin; Ali Golestani
40549733,Identification and Classification of Position-specific GABAA Receptor Subunit Missense Variants for Their Role In Hippocampal Pyramidal Neurons.,"Understanding the effects of functionally unknown variants in epilepsy associated genes is crucial for elucidating disease pathophysiology and developing personalized therapeutics. With a multiscale framework, spanning from DNA sequence to protein function and neural behavior, we describe a novel approach for predicting and investigating pathogenic mutations, hypothesizing that epileptogenic mutations in the GABAA receptor subunit and nearby predicted mutations may produce similar effects on the CA1 pyramidal neuron model. By exploring the characteristic relationships between predicted pathogenic mutations and proximal epileptogenic mutations, the study aims to estimate the effects of predicted mutations based on the effects of epileptogenic mutations on hippocampal pyramidal neuron simulations. The methodology begins with the collection of GABAA receptor γ2 subunit genetic data, followed by data cleaning and formatting performed in R using a custom script. Next, ensemble predictors will be applied to identify and prioritize the pathogenic missense variants of the γ2 subunit. Mapping a specific pathogenic variant (predicted) to the subunit structural domains shared by epileptogenic mutations will be illustrated, accompanied by molecular modeling of their effects and consideration of evolutionary conservation. Then, variant-specific meta-analysis and parameter normalization will be performed, followed by correlation analysis to identify any significant relationships between predicted mutations and proximal epileptogenic mutations. Using a Python-based neural simulator, multi-compartmental conductance-based neuron model, reflecting the effect of wild-type and epileptogenic mutants will be described. Simulation of neural responses generated by epileptogenic GABAA receptor subtype will be considered for the rough estimation of the predicted pathogenic variants' effect on neural response. To our knowledge, this is the first protocol exploring a multiscale framework to estimate the effects of GABAA receptor variants on neuronal behavior, crucial for epilepsy research. This protocol can serve as a foundation for enhancing predictions of cellular phenotypes caused by potentially pathogenic variants of GABAA receptors associated with epilepsy.",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2025,Ayla Arslan; Pınar Öz
40549721,Assessing Social Dominance in Mouse Models Using the Tube Test.,"Social dominance is altered in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases and serves as a useful outcome measure in preclinical studies of these disorders. The tube test is a simple behavioral assay for evaluating social dominance that does not require expensive equipment. In this test, two mice enter opposite ends of a clear plastic tube, and after meeting in the middle, one (the less dominant) must back out. The tube test can be used for both male and female mice and includes several adaptable parameters to suit the investigator's needs. Mice may be tested against multiple unique opponents to provide an index of social dominance. Social dominance in the tube test remains stable over repeated testing and correlates with performance in other social assays. Additionally, the test can be conducted between cage mates to assess within-cage social dominance hierarchies. The tube test is particularly useful in preclinical therapeutic studies, as it enables longitudinal testing before and after experimental interventions. Therefore, it serves as a convenient outcome measure for mechanistic studies and preclinical therapeutic screening.",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2025,Stephanie N Fox; Shreya N Kashyap; Charles F Murchison; Andrew E Arrant; Erik D Roberson

40549690,Compass-Canada's first child psychiatry access program: Implementation and lessons learned.,"There is a lack of mental health and substance use providers for youth in BC, particularly in rural and remote areas. To address these gaps, Canada's first child psychiatry access program, BC Children's Hospital Compass Program, was developed in 2018 to support providers across the province in providing evidence-based mental health and substance use care to youth under 25. This article describes the program's first five years and provides an overview of its creation, utilization, and clinical uses. Quantitative data collected by the Compass Program from September 2018 through September 2023 were analyzed. Participation and utilization of the service by providers in the province were analyzed and descriptive statistics, including means with standard deviations for quantitative variables have been used to describe demographic and other medical factors related to participants. A total of 2336 new providers have been enrolled since Compass' inception. Number of clinical calls into Compass remained steady over the five-year period with an average of 1085 individual providers served per year. Service use is highest in Vancouver Coastal Region (27.3%), followed by Northern Health (21.4%), Interior (15.7%), Vancouver Island (14.5%), and Fraser (13.4%), and Yukon (0.3%). General practitioners make up over a third of all encounters (34.6%), followed closely by pediatrician encounters making up 27.5% of total encounters from 2018-2023. These two provider types comprise over 60% of all encounters over the 5-year timespan. Encounters with other provider types were less common, with the third most common encounter being Child and Youth Mental Health (CYMH) clinicians, totalling 8.6% of total encounters. 37.6% of encounters were for male patients and 42.9% for female patients with 6.8% reporting ""Other"" genders and 12.7% declining to answer. Medication concerns are the most common reason for accessing Compass, regardless of gender. Therapy questions, resource coordination issues, and diagnostic clarification followed in frequency, comprising a similar amount of consults. Compass consultations have the potential to benefit three groups of people: the specific patient being consulted on, the provider requesting the consultation, as well as the provider's colleagues who might benefit from peer consultation. Capacity building is important given Compass receives calls from rural and remote areas where there are no psychiatrists or child psychiatrists where general practitioners and clinicians regularly work with patients along the entire spectrum of mental health and substance use disorders.",PloS one,2025,Vivian W L Tsang; Michelle C Q Lin; Natalie Huang; Sally Tsoi; Jack Hu; Sonja Sinclair; Priya Watson; Susan Baer; Roberto Sassi
40549667,Generation and Characterization of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived Astrocytes Lacking Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein.,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a leading inherited cause of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, has been studied extensively using rodent models. More recently, human stem cell-derived model systems have also been used to gain mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of FXS. However, these studies have focused almost exclusively on neurons. Further, despite growing evidence for a key role of glia in neuronal function in health and disease, little is known about how human astrocytes are affected by FXS. Therefore, in this study, we successfully developed a protocol that captures key spatiotemporal milestones of brain development and aligns with the process of gliogenesis as well. Together this offers a useful framework for studying neurodevelopmental disorders. First, we patterned the human induced pluripotent stem cells into the neuroectodermal lineage with dual Suppressor of Mothers against Decapentaplegic (SMAD) inhibition and small molecules. Subsequently, we utilized specific growth factors and cytokines to generate control (CTRL) and FXS patient-derived astrocytic progenitor cells (APCs). Treatment of APCs with ciliary neurotrophic factor, a differentiating cytokine, regulated and drove the progenitor cells towards astrocytic maturation, yielding forebrain-specific glial fibrillary acidic protein-expressing astrocytes. We found that these astrocytes are functional, as evidenced by their calcium responses to ATP application, and they exhibit dysregulated glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism in FXS. Taken together, these findings provide a useful experimental platform of human origin for the investigation of cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous consequences of alterations in astrocytic function caused by neurodevelopmental disorders.",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2025,Bharath Kumar Reddy; Nikhita Annaiyappa; Aditi Bhattacharya; Sumantra Chattarji; Rakhi Pal

This study was to determine the optimal factor structure of two trauma screening assessments: the PTSD Checklist for <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5)</i> and the International Trauma Questionnaire, within this parent population. Confirmatory factor analysis examined and compared one novel <i>DSM-5</i> model and 14 previously identified <i>DSM-5</i> and <i>International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11)</i> trauma symptom models among Australian parents of autistic children (<i>N</i> = 563). Three <i>DSM-5</i> PTSD models (anhedonia, hybrid, and intrusion/distress) provided a marginal fit, with the novel intrusion/distress model offering a superior fit. None of the five <i>DSM-5</i> models tested achieved a good overall fit. For <i>ICD-11</i>, a three-factor model best fit the latent structure of PTSD symptoms. For complex PTSD (CPTSD), a two-factor second-order model and a six-factor first-order model provided a superior fit over five alternative CPTSD models. Results strongly support the internal reliability and construct validity of the <i>ICD-11</i> PTSD and CPTSD models in Australian parents of autistic children, as measured by the International Trauma Questionnaire. The <i>ICD-11</i> models outperformed the best <i>DSM-5</i> models, highlighting their superiority for this population. While more complex <i>DSM-5</i> models showed better fit than simpler ones, they still did not achieve a good overall fit. Notably, the results were largely consistent when assessing individuals meeting Criterion A for PTSD, specifically in relation to parenting-related traumatic experiences. The International Trauma Questionnaire is a more reliable and suitable tool for assessing PTSD and CPTSD in Australian parents of autistic children.

40549583,Seizure Activity Induced by Electroshock in Drosophila Larvae.,"Epilepsy presents a significant health burden that is exacerbated by high numbers of individuals who are drug-refractory. Whilst some drug-refractory patients do respond to non-drug treatments (e.g., vagal nerve stimulation, ketogenic diet, etc.), the last resort for many is challenging and expensive surgery to provide relief from seizures. Whilst it is generally acknowledged that antiseizure medications with a broader range of targets are required, the hurdle in achieving this is the identification of novel drug targets. Genetically tractable model animals offer promise in this regard. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has become a powerful model for investigating the mechanistic basis of, and better treatments for, seizures. Many identified fly mutations result in larvae and adults exhibiting seizure-like activity in response to strong stimulation (electrical, mechanical, and/or thermal). Many of these mutations are in genes homologous to those that contribute to human genetic epilepsies (e.g., the voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channel). It is also now possible to replace a fly gene with its human equivalent that additionally, carries a disease-related mutation. Thus, the humble fly has become an avatar to model human disease. This study describes a suitable method to use Drosophila larvae for low to medium-throughput drug screens to identify unique compounds, and their targets, that have antiseizure potential.",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2025,Mariam Huertas Radi; Jack Corke; Richard A Baines
40549579,Sleep disturbances and PTSD: identifying baseline predictors of insomnia response in an intensive treatment programme.,"<b>Objective:</b> This study examined whether baseline demographic and clinical variables could predict clinically significant reductions in insomnia symptoms among veterans receiving a 2-week Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)-based intensive PTSD treatment programme (ITP). A key aim was to identify individuals likely to benefit from additional, sleep-focused interventions.<b>Method:</b> A total of 449 veterans completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) at baseline, post-treatment, and at 1- and 3-month follow-up. Linear mixed models were used to analyse insomnia trajectories and clinical predictors (e.g. PTSD severity, depression, posttrauma cognitions, neurobehavioral symptoms). Machine learning models (neural net, random forest, elastic net, and ensemble) were trained to classify participants with clinically meaningful insomnia improvements.<b>Results:</b> Veterans reported large average PTSD severity reductions (<i>d</i> = 0.96), whereas depression and insomnia symptoms reduced moderately (<i>d</i> = 0.57) and modestly (<i>d</i> = 0.34), respectively. Higher PTSD severity, depression severity, negative posttrauma cognitions, and neurobehavioral symptoms were linked to poorer insomnia outcomes. None of the demographic or military service factors significantly predicted insomnia trajectories. Machine learning models performed only slightly better than chance (AUC range = 0.52-0.62) in predicting insomnia severity reductions.<b>Conclusions:</b> Although insomnia symptoms improved during the ITP and improvements persisted up to 3-month follow-up, a substantial number of veterans continued to experience significant sleep problems post-treatment. Given the limited predictive accuracy of machine learning models using self-reported variables, incorporating additional biological or psychosocial factors may be necessary to identify veterans with PTSD who need more specialised sleep interventions.",European journal of psychotraumatology,2025,Philip Held; Ashby Boland; Sarah A Pridgen; Dale L Smith

To address this issue, this study aimed to predict 28-day unplanned hospital re-admission for these patients. From linked de-identified datasets, patients with alcohol use disorders who had hospital re-admissions between 2015 and 2018 were identified. Univariate and multiple logistic regression were conducted to select variables for inclusion in five machine learning models-logistic regression (baseline), random forest, support vector machine, long-short term memory and clinical bio bidirectional encoder representation of transformers (Clinical Bio-BERT)-to predict the 28-day re-admission. Eight hundred and sixty-nine patients with alcohol use disorders incurred 2254 hospital admissions. Patients aged 45-49 or 70-74 or 75-79 were 4-5 times more likely to be re-admitted than those in other age groups; males were 36% more likely than females; patients who use polysubstance were 3.3 times more likely than otherwise. Patients with ""respiratory system disorders"" or ""hepatobiliary system and pancreas disorders"" had 60% higher risk than otherwise.

40549433,Digital Decision Aids to Support Decision-Making in Palliative and End-of-Life Dementia Care: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Making a care-related decision is a complex cognitive process. Patient decision aids could provide information on potential options about risks and benefits, incorporate individual values and preferences, and help people with dementia or their family carers make decisions about palliative and end-of-life care. This systematic review aimed to critically evaluate and synthesize evidence on the effectiveness of digital decision aids to support decision-making in palliative and end-of-life care for patients with dementia, their family carers, or clinicians. A systematic literature search in 4 health-related databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science) was performed in September 2024. Articles were included if the study focused on the development and evaluation of a digital decision support tool on end-of-life dementia care, used an experimental design, and was available in full text in English. Studies using a nonexperimental design were excluded. The Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool Version 2.0 or the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions Version 2.0 was used to assess risk of bias. Narrative synthesis and meta-analyses were performed to comprehensively summarize the technologies and outcomes of the decision aids. The literature search across datasets identified a total of 1274 records. With an additional 5 records from citation searching and reference reviewing, a total of 20 articles were included, with 10 studies using data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 10 pretest-posttest pilot studies. Technologies of visual aids, videos, web pages, and telehealth were reported in the included studies to support decision-making for end-of-life dementia care. Most decision aids focused on the decision about the primary goal of care (life-prolonging care, limited care, and comfort care), except for 1 visual aid focusing on the decisions about feeding tube placement and drug treatment for dementia. Most decision aids engaged both patients and their family carers. Pilot studies examining feasibility showed that most participants found these decision aids relevant to their needs and easy to use, and were able to complete the intervention sessions. Meta-analyses of 4 RCTs showed that video decision aids were effective in increasing the proportion of participants opting for comfort care (odds ratio 3.81, 95% CI 1.92-7.56) but inconclusive for the proportion of documented do-not-hospitalize orders (odds ratio 1.60, 95% CI 0.70-3.67), compared to the control group. Internet-based decision aids offer a feasible and acceptable approach to support the shared decision-making between patients, families, and clinicians. The included studies reported various outcome measures, including preferred goal of care, quality of palliative care, decision-making performance, and health care use. More large-scale RCTs are needed, and consistent outcome measures should be considered to evaluate the effects of end-of-life decision aids.

40549427,"AI in Medical Questionnaires: Innovations, Diagnosis, and Implications.","This systematic review aimed to explore the current applications, potential benefits, and issues of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical questionnaires, focusing on its role in 3 main functions: assessment, development, and prediction. The global mental health burden remains severe. The World Health Organization reports that >1 billion people worldwide experience mental disorders, with the prevalence of depression and anxiety among children and adolescents at 2.6% and 6.5%, respectively. However, commonly used clinical questionnaires such as the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory suffer from several problems, including the high degree of overlap of symptoms of depression with those of other psychiatric disorders and a lack of professional supervision during administration of the questionnaires, which often lead to inaccurate diagnoses. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the health care system is facing the dual challenges of a surge in patient numbers and the complexity of mental health issues. AI technology has now been shown to have great promise in improving diagnostic accuracy, assisting clinical decision-making, and simplifying questionnaire development and data analysis. To systematically assess the value of AI in medical questionnaires, this study searched 5 databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure) for the period from database inception to September 2024. Of 49,091 publications, a total of 14 (0.03%) studies met the inclusion criteria. AI technologies showed significant advantages in assessment, such as distinguishing myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome from long COVID-19 with 92.18% accuracy. In questionnaire development, natural language processing using generative models such as ChatGPT was used to construct culturally competent scales. In terms of disease prediction, one study had an area under the curve of 0.790 for cataract surgery risk prediction. Overall, 24 AI technologies were identified, covering traditional algorithms such as random forest, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbor, as well as deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks, Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers, and ChatGPT. Despite the positive findings, only 21% (3/14) of the studies had entered the clinical validation phase, whereas the remaining 79% (11/14) were still in the exploratory phase of research. Most of the studies (10/14, 71%) were rated as being of moderate methodological quality, with major limitations including lack of a control group, incomplete follow-up data, and inadequate validation systems. In summary, the integrated application of AI in medical questionnaires has significant potential to improve diagnostic efficiency, accelerate scale development, and promote early intervention. Future research should pay more attention to model interpretability, system compatibility, validation standardization, and ethical governance to effectively address key challenges such as data privacy, clinical integration, and transparency.",Journal of medical Internet research,2025,Xuexing Luo; Yiyuan Li; Jing Xu; Zhong Zheng; Fangtian Ying; Guanghui Huang
40549406,Role of Sleep and White Matter in the Link Between Screen Time and Depression in Childhood and Early Adolescence.,"With the widespread adoption of screen-based devices among adolescents, there is growing concern that more screen time could contribute to mental health problems such as depression. It is thus critical to identify potential mediating factors that could help explain this potential risk relationship. Recent evidence indicates that more screen time could impact sleep duration and brain structural connectivity (ie, white matter organization), which are critical for emotional health. Notably, sleep duration is a modifiable behavior that health care providers can easily target. To identify the association between screen time during late childhood and depressive symptoms in early adolescence, and to investigate whether these associations are mediated by sleep duration and white matter organization. This prospective study was conducted from January 2024 to June 2024. Data from the Adolescent Behavior Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study were used to identify clinical and neuroimaging characteristics of participants at late childhood (T1; defined as aged 9-10 years) and early adolescence (T2; defined as age 11-13 years). Children and their parent/caregiver were recruited across 21 US cities. Participants with no past/current psychiatric disorders at T1 were selected for analyses. Initial analyses were conducted in 2024 and finalized in February 2025. Outcomes included screen time assessed using a self-report questionnaire, sleep duration assessed using the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire, and depressive symptoms characterized using the Child Behavior Checklist. Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging and a tract profile approach were used to characterize the orientation dispersion index of 3 white matter tracts that are known to be implicated with depression: cingulum bundle, forceps minor, and uncinate fasciculus. Analyses included 976 participants (460 children [47.1%] were female, mean [SD] age was 9.9 [0.6] years at T1 and 11.9 [0.6] years at T2). Each additional hour of daily screen time at T1 was associated with a 0.12-point (95% CI, 0.04-0.20; P = .008) increase in Child Behavior Checklist depressive score at T2. Shorter sleep duration and worse cingulum bundle organization (greater orientation dispersion index) at T2 mediated 36.4% (95% CI, 18.2%-63.6%) of the association between more screen time and more depressive symptoms. Results of this study show that more screen time in late childhood was associated with more depressive symptoms, potentially due to shorter sleep and worse white matter organization during early adolescence. These findings emphasize the importance of promoting healthy habits and balancing screen time with adequate sleep.",JAMA pediatrics,2025,João Paulo Lima Santos; Adriane M Soehner; Candice L Biernesser; Cecile D Ladouceur; Amelia Versace
40549386,Central Precocious Puberty and Psychiatric Disorders.,"Within the physiological range, early pubertal timing is associated with an increased risk of mental health issues. Previous studies examining the associations of central precocious puberty (CPP) with mental health have yielded inconclusive results. To describe the risk for development of psychiatric disorders in patients with CPP and to identify periods during which patients with CPP are at heightened risk of developing psychopathological conditions. In this population-based, retrospective cohort study, patients with CPP and matched controls were identified from German health insurance data (approximately 6.5 million individuals) and followed from January 2010 to June 2023. Individuals were included if they had continuous insurance coverage for at least 2 years during the study period. Data were analyzed from July 2024 to March 2025. Diagnosis of CPP. Diagnosis of depression, anxiety disorders, oppositional defiant and conduct disorders (ODD/CD), and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Incidence rates for psychiatric disorders before and after the diagnosis of CPP were compared between patients and controls exactly matched for sex, birth year interval, insurance period, and obesity. After the application of validation criteria, 1094 patients with idiopathic CPP (438 born from 2010-2014 [40.0%]; 999 female [91.3%]; 249 [22.8%] with obesity) were identified and compared with 5448 controls (2184 born between 2010-2014 [40.1%]; 4975 female [91.3%]; 1242 with obesity [22.8%]). Compared with controls, patients with CPP were more likely to receive a diagnosis of any mental disorder (270 patients [24.7%] vs 920 controls [16.9%]; adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 1.48; 95% CI, 1.31-1.67), depression (82 patients [7.5%] vs 252 controls [4.6%]; aRR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.37-2.20), anxiety disorders (88 patients [8.0%] vs 312 controls [5.7%]; aRR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.16-1.82), ODD/CD (87 patients [8.0%] vs 243 controls [4.5%]; aRR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.39-2.23), and ADHD (123 patients [11.2%] vs 397 controls [7.3%]; aRR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.27-1.86). Temporal trends showed increased incidence rates for ODD/CD even before the diagnosis of CPP. For depression and ADHD, incidence rates remained increased for at least 8 years after the initial CPP diagnosis. In this retrospective cohort study of patients with CPP, CPP was associated with an increased risk of psychiatric disorders, with evidence supporting long-term mental health outcomes, suggesting that caretakers of children with CPP should be vigilant for the emergence of psychiatric symptoms to initiate psychiatric care at an early stage.",JAMA network open,2025,Lars Dinkelbach; Corinna Grasemann; Cordula Kiewert; Lisa Leikeim; Börge Schmidt; Raphael Hirtz
40549360,Construct validity of the CoCo-P: Associations between cognitive complaints during participation and cognitive and emotional consequences.,"Cognitive complaints are common following acquired brain injury (ABI) and can hinder social participation. To address this, the CoCo-P was developed as a tool to identify cognitive restrictions experienced in various everyday contexts, such as work and leisure. This study aimed to evaluate the construct validity of the CoCo-P by assessing its associations with two widely used clinical questionnaires, the USER-P and CLCE-24, as reference measures. Forty-five ABI survivors completed these questionnaires, along with assessments of mood (HADS), self-efficacy (GSES), health-related quality of life (EQ6D), and cognitive functioning (MoCA). Results indicated strong positive associations between the CoCo-P and both USER-P and CLCE-24. Additionally, self-efficacy was strongly negatively associated with reported restrictions, while no significant associations were observed with estimated mood disorders or cognitive functions. These findings demonstrate the construct validity of the CoCo-P, supporting its potential as a valid tool for assessing cognitive restrictions experienced in daily life by individuals with ABI.",Applied neuropsychology.

40549359,Investigating Awareness and Acceptance of Digital Phenotyping in Dhaka's Korail Slum: Qualitative Study.,"Digital phenotyping (DP), the process of using data from digital devices, such as smartphones and wearable technology to understand and monitor people's behavior, health, and daily activities, has shown significant promise in mental health care within high-income countries. However, its application in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is limited, particularly among impoverished populations such as slum residents. This study investigates the awareness, knowledge, acceptance, and implementation of DP, including willingness to share data, and concerns regarding privacy and data security, among residents of Dhaka's Korail slum, one of Bangladesh's largest and most densely populated informal settlements. Understanding awareness, acceptance, and privacy concerns surrounding DP in these settings is critical for its effective implementation. We conducted 8 focus group discussions with 79% (30/38) of female participants (mean age 37, SD 13.7 years). Participants included 20 individuals diagnosed with serious mental disorders and 18 caregivers. The focus group discussions also included a section explaining what DP is. Smartphone ownership was reported by 45% (17/38) of the participants, while 92% (35/38) of the participants had access to a smartphone through family members. There was a general lack of awareness about DP among the participants. Initially, 92% (35/38) of participants had no prior knowledge of DP, but after receiving an explanation, they acknowledged its potential applications and benefits. Participants recognized the use of DP for health monitoring, particularly in managing mental health conditions. Participants expressed willingness to share certain types of data, particularly phone usage and location data, provided that content-level information remained private. Despite these perceived benefits, significant concerns about privacy and data security emerged. Participants expressed fears about the potential misuse of their personal information, with some feeling resigned to the idea of already being constantly monitored. Trust in DP tools emerged as a critical factor for adoption, highlighting the need for transparent data protection policies and user control over data sharing. Additionally, participants emphasized the importance of adapting DP tools to local contexts, including cultural considerations and technological literacy. While DP presents a promising avenue for mental health support in underserved urban populations, its adoption in LMIC slum settings requires targeted educational initiatives, robust privacy safeguards, and community involvement to ensure trust and usability. DP tools should be adapted to fit the cultural context of the target population, possibly involving modifications to the types of data collected or the way data are interpreted. While DP holds potential to improve mental health care in underserved communities, addressing barriers related to awareness, privacy, culture, and usability is crucial. Focusing on educational initiatives, robust data protection, cultural adaptation, user-friendly design, and community engagement, DP can become a valuable tool in bridging the mental health care gap in LMICs.",JMIR formative research,2025,Nadia Alam; Domenico Giacco; Bulbul Siddiqi; Swaran P Singh; Sagar Jilka
40549357,Challenges faced by Medicaid managed care coordinators working with members with substance use disorder.,"Medicaid managed care organization (MCO) care coordinators play a crucial role in assisting high-need Medicaid members with substance use disorder (SUD) and facilitating their connections with medical and social services. This study assessed challenges faced by care coordinators serving patients with SUD, including the types and frequencies of barriers, associated care coordinator and patient factors, and their relationship with burnout and job satisfaction. Web-based survey data from 322 Virginia Medicaid MCO care coordinators. Coordinators rated 15 barriers related to providing services to patients with SUD. Principal components analysis (PCA) identified 3 subscales categorizing these challenges (challenges accessing resources, administrative and regulatory burden, and data integration). Multivariable linear regression explored associations between coordinator and patient factors and subscales for categories of barriers. Pearson correlations were used to examine the relationship between these barriers and job satisfaction. Coordinators reported a high frequency of challenges in many care coordinating activities: Between 49% and 82% reported each barrier as ""somewhat"" of a problem or a ""major"" problem. Using PCA, 3 main categories of barriers were identified. Having a high proportion of patients with SUD was associated with greater difficulties in accessing resources (P < .01) and data integration issues (P < .05), and working for specific MCOs was associated with all 3 categories of barriers (P < .05). Job satisfaction and burnout were correlated with all 3 categories as well and were most strongly associated with administrative and regulatory burden. Care coordinators face multiple challenges serving Medicaid members, particularly those with SUD. State-level Medicaid policies supporting care coordinators may help.",The American journal of managed care,2025,Sarah J Marks; Valentina Vega; David Zhu; Hannah Shadowen; Ashley Harrell; Jason Lowe; Andrew Mitchell; Andrew J Barnes; Peter J Cunningham
40549329,Congenital syphilis: adverse pregnancy outcomes and neonatal disorders.,"Treponema pallidum (T. pallidum) poses a significant hazard to the health of both expectant mothers and neonates. The bacterium can be transmitted via the placenta from an infected mother to the fetus during pregnancy. Congenital syphilis may occur if the infant is exposed to the infection through contact with the mother's body fluids after delivery. The symptoms of congenital syphilis can severely compromise a newborn's health. In addition to various pathological anomalies, affected children may face skin, bone, internal organ, and nervous system issues. These complications can lead to long-term developmental delays, cognitive impairments, and increased risk of infections. Early detection and treatment are crucial to mitigate these risks and promote healthier outcomes for both the infant and the mother. The worldwide prevalence of congenital syphilis is escalating, rising from 203 cases per 100,000 in 2015 to 295 cases per 100,000 in 2021. The primary treatment for syphilis is currently penicillin G therapy, which produces reliable clinical efficacy. This review offers a thorough analysis of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth, miscarriage, stillbirth, and neonatal disorders such as skin lesions and skeletal malformations. The aim is to foster the development of innovative preventive and early diagnostic strategies through a thorough analysis of diagnostic data. These initiatives are expected to reduce the number of affected children significantly, hence enhancing societal stability and safeguarding the health of mothers and infants.",Infection,2025,Baihuan Duan; Yuefang Zhou; Xinyi Wang; Huiqiao Wang; Yan Li; Xiang Zhou; Yujun Tang; Chenbin Zhu; Peng Liu; Jiaofeng Peng
40549322,The potential impact of clindamycin on neurosurgery patients: a randomized controlled trial.,"The study investigates whether adding clindamycin to neurosurgery patients' as a postsurgical management regimen improves recovery, provides neuroprotection, and prevents neurological complications. Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and neurotensin (NT) were measured as biomarkers of inflammation, brain damage, and neuronal apoptosis. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups (n = 22 each) to receive the standard management plus either ceftriaxone (2 g / 12 h) or plus ceftriaxone and clindamycin (900 mg/8 h) as a combination therapy for seven days. NSE serum levels in the clindamycin and control group on day 3 were (10.01 ± 1.64) versus (23.77 ± 11.75), respectively (p = 0.0001). NT serum levels in the clindamycin and control groups on day 3 were (4.5 ± 2.8) versus (8.29 ± 7.97), respectively (p = 0.0418). Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on day 3 was (14.32 ± 1.13) versus (14.23 ± 1.31) in the clindamycin and the control groups, respectively, (p = 0.724). SOFA score assessed on day 3 (5 (22.7%)) and (1 (4.5%)) had grade 1, (15 (68.25)) and (14 (63.35)) had grade 2, (1 (4.5%)) and (5 (22.7%)) had grade 3, (0 (0.0%)) and (1 (4.5%)) had grade 4, and (1 (4.5%)) and (1 (4.5%)) had grade 5 in the clindamycin and control groups, respectively. Adjunctive use of clindamycin might be a novel option that reduces secondary neurological injury/damage after neurosurgeries.

40549283,Project ImPACT Reduces Social Hyporesponsiveness and Translates to More Optimal Expressive Language Outcomes in Some Infants at Increased Likelihood of Autism.,"Low responsiveness to sensory stimuli, particularly stimuli that are social in nature (i.e., social hyporesponsiveness), predicts expressive language in autistic children and in infant siblings of autistic children (Sibs-autism), who are at high likelihood for a future diagnosis of autism and developmental language disorder. However, our understanding of whether social hyporesponsiveness can be addressed via early intervention to improve expressive language outcomes of Sibs-autism is limited. This randomized controlled trial investigated whether Project ImPACT, a caregiver-implemented Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Intervention (NDBI), has an indirect effect on expressive language outcomes by reducing social hyporesponsiveness.  Sibs-autism were randomized into a Project ImPACT group (n = 23) for 12 weeks of intervention, or into a non-Project ImPACT control group (n = 23). Social hyporesponsiveness was measured immediately following intervention, and expressive language was measured three months after the end of intervention. Project ImPACT indirectly influenced distal expressive language outcomes through social hyporesponsiveness, but only for infants whose caregivers had high levels of education at study entry. Clinical implications of the results are discussed.",Journal of autism and developmental disorders,2025,Jennifer E Markfeld; Jacob I Feldman; Catherine T Bush; Paul J Yoder; Tiffany G Woynaroski
40549270,"Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of Adjunctive Brivaracetam in Japanese and Chinese Patients with Focal-Onset Seizures: Interim Analysis of a Phase 3 Open-Label Extension Trial.","This trial evaluated long-term safety, tolerability, and maintenance of efficacy of adjunctive brivaracetam (BRV) in Japanese and Chinese patients aged ≥ 16 years with focal-onset seizures (FOS). Interim analysis of data from EP0085 (NCT03250377), a long-term follow-up trial of adjunctive BRV 50-200 mg/day in Japanese and Chinese patients. Post hoc analyses assessed efficacy for 12- and 24-month completers and BRV retention. At data cutoff (June 1, 2023), 207 patients had enrolled; of these, 157 (75.8%) were ongoing and 50 (24.2%) had discontinued. Overall, 137 patients were 12-month completers and 63 were 24-month completers. Mean age was 36.7 years and 107 (51.7%) patients were female (100 [48.3%] male). Mean duration of epilepsy was 17.16 years. At data cutoff, total duration of BRV exposure was 378.5 patient-years. Mean duration of BRV exposure was 667.8 days (median 427.0 days), with a median modal dose of 200.0 mg/day (range 25.0-200.0 mg/day). Kaplan-Meier-estimated BRV retention rates at 12, 24, and 36 months were 85%, 76%, and 68%, respectively. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported by 184 (88.9%) patients, drug-related TEAEs by 60 (29.0%), serious TEAEs by 29 (14.0%), and 8 (3.9%) discontinued as a result of TEAEs. Median FOS frequency/28 days decreased from 7.59 during baseline to 4.11 during the evaluation period. For the overall evaluation period, 12-month, and 24-month completers, median percentage reductions from baseline in FOS frequency/28 days were 42.4%, 44.0%, and 38.9%, respectively, and 50% responder rates were 46.4%, 46.7%, and 38.1%. Based on this interim and post hoc analysis, long-term adjunctive BRV was well tolerated and efficacious in Japanese and Chinese patients with FOS. The efficacy response was maintained over time in those completing 12 and 24 months of trial participation. Overall, 68% of patients remained on BRV treatment for 3 years.

40549225,Update on paraproteinemic neuropathy.,"This article reviews recent clinical updates and research on the evaluation and management of patients with peripheral neuropathy in association with monoclonal gammopathies. Recent studies have elucidated pathogenic mechanisms of IgM paraprotein associated neuropathies, including nodal and paranodal targets and complement mediated processes, suggesting novel therapeutic targets. New chemotherapeutic regimens have improved outcomes and neurotoxic side effect profiles in the treatment of patients with light chain (AL) amyloidosis and POEMS syndrome. Establishing when a monoclonal gammopathy is causative of a peripheral neuropathy remains a clinical challenge. New therapeutic drugs for treatment of IgM paraprotein associated neuropathies show promise. Identifying AL amyloidosis and POEMS early in patients presenting with neuropathy are important. Clinical phenotyping and antibody testing are critical to evaluating patients with paraproteins and peripheral neuropathy.",Current neurology and neuroscience reports,2025,Rebecca Traub; Samuel M Rubinstein; Christopher Dittus
40549216,Can short-term memory capacity change resting brain behavior? Findings from neuropsychological assessment and dynamic causal modeling.,"This study aimed to investigate different short-term memory capacities (STMC) on resting brain of healthy individuals particularly the neuropsychology and connectivity behaviors. The outcomes may serve as a baseline for clinical diagnosis of memory decline due to aging and mental disorders. It was hypothesized that resting brain of low and typical STMC individuals behaves differently. Thirty-nine healthy young male adults were recruited from local universities. They were categorized as typical or low STMC based on their scores in the Malay Version of the Auditory-Verbal Learning Test (MVAVLT). A resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was conducted and data were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) and dynamic causal modeling (DCM). Nine neuropsychological assessments were significantly higher (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in typical STMC participants compared with low STMC participants. Four activation clusters survived the contrast ""Low > Typical"" uncorrected at set and cluster levels threshold (<i>p</i><sub>FWE</sub> < 0.05). A causal model containing these clusters as nodes found that there is no preference on negative or positive connectivity among typical and low STMC groups. Nevertheless, implementing a reduced connection scheme revealed more significant connections for the low STMC group. To conclude, the low STMC participants scored lower in all neuropsychological assessments, but a higher activation profile with more areas being connected effectively as compared with the typical STMC group. The results suggest a higher resting neural activity and communication among certain brain areas in low STMC individuals that the brain could have executed as a compensation strategy.",Applied neuropsychology.

40549212,NOVA2 expression in pituitary gland and in functioning and non-functioning pituitary adenomas: a preliminary study.,"Pituitary adenomas (PAs) are generally benign tumors with varying clinical presentations. While functioning PAs (FPAs) secrete hormones leading to distinct endocrine disorders, non-functioning PAs (NFPAs) often manifest with mass effect symptoms. Current medical therapies for PAs have limited efficacy, particularly for NFPAs. This highlights the need for new diagnostic and therapeutic targets. This study aimed to investigate the expression of Neuro-Oncological Ventral Antigen 2 (NOVA2), a factor involved in alternative splicing, in normal pituitary glands and PAs, to evaluate its potential as a novel therapeutic target. Tissue samples from 12 PA patients (9 NFPAs and 3 FPAs) and 8 normal pituitary glands were collected. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to assess NOVA2 expression. Semi-quantitative evaluation of NOVA2 staining was conducted using Histoscore. NOVA2 was expressed in the endothelial cells of both PAs and normal pituitary glands, with higher expression in PAs. Notably, NOVA2 was present in PA cells regardless of adenoma type, while normal pituitary epithelial cells were negative for NOVA2 expression. There was no statistically significant difference in NOVA2 expression between FPAs and NFPAs. This is the first study to demonstrate that NOVA2 is expressed in PA cells but not in normal pituitary epithelial cells. These findings suggest that NOVA2 could serve as a potential target for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in PAs, especially considering the lack of specific biomarkers and effective medical therapies for these tumors. Further research with a larger sample size is warranted to validate these preliminary findings.",Acta neurochirurgica,2025,Pasquale De Bonis; Francesca Ghidoni; Veronica Tisato; Erika Rimondi; Roberta Gafà; Michele Picciocchi; Maria Chiara Zatelli; Alba Scerrati; Michele Alessandro Cavallo; Alba Madoglio
40549196,Enhanced identification of novel pathogenic variants in hereditary hearing loss through physical phasing with integrated short and long-read sequencing data.,"Haplotagged variant calling is essential for determining genetic etiologies in hereditary hearing loss (HHL) cases when familial testing is unavailable, and long-read whole-genome sequencing (lrWGS) enables this by outperforming in several key areas: enhanced detection of structural variations (SVs) and precise long-range haplotype phasing. In this study, we enrolled two HL cases from the China Deafness Genetics Consortium (CDGC) cohort, whose genetic tests were previously inconclusive due to a lack of pedigree segregation data. Small variants (including SNVs and InDels) profiles were generated by short-read whole-genome sequencing (srWGS), while SVs were identified and co-phased with small variants using a read-based approach. As a result, 87% and 83% of the chromosomal regions were successfully phased, and reached mean haplotype block lengths up to 661.9 kb and 309.9 kb, respectively. A total of 483 and 434 small variants, along with three and six heterozygous SVs in coding and splice regions of 201 HL-associated genes were phased. Pathogenic interpretations resolved compound heterozygosity in MARVELD2, identifying a pathogenic (P) variant NM_001038603.3:c.782G > A in trans with a novel pathogenic (P) deletion (NM_001038603.3:c.1183-1288_1503 + 195del). Additionally, we identified a known P variant NM_022124.6:c.5369-1G > A, which was oriented in trans with a P deletion NM_022124.6:c.-5-12_67 + 154del in the CDH23 gene. This study demonstrates the clinical utility of integrating srWGS and Nanopore lrWGS for comprehensive variant detection and haplotype determination in HL cases with limited family background details, providing a robust framework for resolving complex genetic etiologies and improving diagnostic precision.",Molecular genetics and genomics : MGG,2025,Lu Kang; Qian Zhang; Chao Wang; Jia Geng; Xinlei Li; Mingjun Zhong; Sihan Liu; Xuegang Wang; Yu Lu; Jing Cheng; Yongxin Ma; Fengxiao Bu; Huijun Yuan
40549179,Quantification of Lewy body pathology by cerebrospinal fluid endpoint dilution RT-QuIC in a neuropathological autopsy cohort of clinically heterogeneous participants.,"The identification of biomarkers predicting the burden of brain alpha-synuclein (α-syn) pathology in vivo represents a research priority in Lewy body disease (LBD). Recently, some kinetic parameters of seed amplification assays (SAAs) for α-syn showed associations with measures of clinical progression. However, preanalytical and analytical factors significantly affect these parameters, reducing reproducibility. The Endpoint Dilution (ED) SAA Real-time Quaking-induced Conversion (RT-QuIC) is emerging as an alternative, more accurate tool for seed quantification. Still, the approach needs validation in large patient cohorts. We applied the ED RT-QuIC to postmortem ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 357 brain donors, including 168 who showed LBD at neuropathologic examination. We estimated the seeding dose, yielding positive responses in 50% of replicate reactions (SD50), using the midSIN algorithm and correlated these values with postmortem synuclein pathology burden and clinical severity measures. LBD was staged through the Unified Staging System for Lewy Body Disorders and the Lewy pathology consensus criteria. The SD50 values (expressed in log<sub>10</sub>SD/ml) differed significantly among participants at different LBD stages (p < 0.0001), with those at a neocortical stage demonstrating higher values than those at a brainstem-predominant stage (p < 0.0001). The SD50 values were significantly associated with the LBD load evaluated through immunohistochemistry (Rho = 0.62, p < 0.0001). Participants showing higher SD50 values performed worse at the last available scores on clinical scales evaluating motor (Rho = 0.33, p < 0.0001) and olfactory functions (Rho = - 0.33, p < 0.0001). The SD50 scores accurately distinguished neocortical LBD participants from those at lower stages (area under the curve, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.79-0.92). The CSF ED RT-QuIC measure of α-syn seeds correlated significantly with LBD burden and clinical severity scores. These findings validate the CSF ED RT-QuIC as a quantitative assay for misfolded brain α-syn in LBD. This novel approach may be clinically applied to identify individuals at different stages of LBD pathology in research settings.",Acta neuropathologica,2025,Andrea Mastrangelo; Serena Caldera; Sophie E Mastenbroek; Erica Vittoriosi; Shorena Janelidze; Geidy E Serrano; Alireza Atri; Holly Shill; Erika Driver-Dunckley; Shyamal Mehta; Charles H Adler; Angela Mammana; Franco Magliocchetti; Simone Baiardi; Thomas G Beach; Oskar Hansson; Piero Parchi
40549177,Beta-band desynchronization in the human hippocampus during movement preparation in a delayed reach task.,"Though the hippocampus is known for its role in memory and navigation, growing evidence has suggested that it is involved in voluntary movement. By investigating whether the hippocampus is active during movement preparation, we can understand its role in motor control. In this study, we utilized a Delayed Reach task to measure beta-band (13-30 Hz) amplitude changes in the human hippocampus during movement preparation. We hypothesized to observe beta-band event-related desynchronization (ERD) during the movement preparation phases. Eleven patients diagnosed with drug-resistant epilepsy were implanted with stereoelectroencephalographic (SEEG) depth electrodes and SEEG signals were recorded. We pre-processed the raw neural signals using the zap-line noise removal technique and re-referenced the data using a novel weighted electrode shaft re-referencing technique. The beta-band Power Spectral Density (PSD) was calculated using multi-taper spectral analysis and trial averaged PSD between task phases was compared using a cluster-based permutation test. We then compared modulation between ipsilateral vs. contralateral contacts using the group-level Yate's z-test. 91% of participants and 46.8% of hippocampal gray matter contacts (n = 149) exhibited significant beta-band ERD during the Delay phase compared to baseline. During the Response phase, 100% of participants and 69.8% of hippocampal gray matter contacts exhibited significant beta-band decreases. We observed no significant difference between ipsilateral and contralateral contacts (p > 0.05). This study is the first to demonstrate hippocampal beta-band modulation during movement preparation, implying that the hippocampus may be involved during the movement processing.",Experimental brain research,2025,Xiecheng Shao; Ryan S Chung; Shivani Sundaram; Roberto Martin Del Campo-Vera; Jonathon Cavaleri; Selena Zhang; Adith Swarup; Alexandra Kammen; Miguel Parra; Xenos Mason; Christi Heck; Charles Y Liu; Spencer S Kellis; Brian Lee
40549163,The repair of large meningomyelocele defects using perforator artery-based non-island fasciocutaneous flaps.,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes and complications of surgically closing myelomeningocele (MMC) defects in infants using perforator artery-based non-island fasciocutaneous flaps. Between January 2022 and March 2024, 12 infants (8 girls and 4 boys) underwent closure surgery for MMC defects. All patients underwent surgery in the first 48 h after delivery. All newborn care, laboratory, and radiological values of patients who underwent surgery within 48 h after birth were performed. The surgery to be applied was determined according to the evaluations of plastic surgery, anesthesia clinic, and neurosurgery. All patients were evaluated in the newborn clinic, and their postoperative close follow-ups were conducted there. The surgical area was evaluated together by plastic surgery and neurosurgery. The most frequent surgical flap problem was venous congestion in the flap's distal part (75% of instances, nine patients). Wound dehiscence occurred at the flap edge in 25% of our patients (three patients), in the T zone of the donor site in 20% (two patients), and on both sides in 5% (one patient), all of which were successfully treated without surgery. None of the patients developed hematomas, but seroma was seen in 10% of the donor regions. There was no flap loss or total necrosis. No patient had a reoperation due to flap-related problems. Our follow-up period was 4 months, and no late-stage problems (wound dehiscence or sinus) were detected. CONCLUSıON: We believe closing a MMC defect with a perforator artery-based non-island fasciocutaneous flap is a safe and successful procedure with low morbidity. The most common consequences are venous congestion and mild wound dehiscence, which are often addressed as non-surgical problems. Long-term follow-ups revealed no late problems.",Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,2025,Necati Ucler; Recep Anlatıcı
40549046,The prognostic value of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity in patients with lung cancer receiving immunotherapy: a propensity score matching study.,"Sarcopenic obesity (SO) is a prognostic factor and its impact on response to immunotherapy is still unknown in lung cancer. We aimed to explore the role of SO and body composition in predicting overall survival (OS) in patients with lung cancer receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We conducted a retrospective study involving 119 patients with lung cancer who underwent immunotherapy. The subcutaneous fat area (SFA), visceral fat area (VFA) and skeletal muscle index (SMI) were determined by the cross-sectional computed tomography at the L3 lumbar vertebral level. Sarcopenia and SO were defined by SMI and body mass index. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard analyses were used to evaluate the impact of body composition on survival. The propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was used to reduce bias and a nomogram was created to predict the OS. The Kaplan-Meier survival showed that patients with sarcopenia and SO had poor survival time in the total and PSM cohort. The Cox analyses revealed that sarcopenia (Hazard ratio (HR): 2.04, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.04-4.01, P = 0.039) and SO (HR: 3.17, 95%CI: 1.49-6.75, P = 0.003) were independent OS predictors. SFA and VFA were not associated with OS. The SMI, age, stage, albumin level and SFA were used to develop a nomogram. Patients with high nomogram scores had worse OS (P < 0.0001). Sarcopenia and SO are prognostic factors in patients with lung cancer receiving ICIs. A nomogram that integrates body composition is sufficiently accurate for predicting OS in patients with lung cancer receiving immunotherapy.",The oncologist,2025,Wen Wang; Xintian Xu; Hongming Liu; Yongxia Cui; Qian Han; Tingting Yang; Mengxing Tian; Yu Qian; Xin Jin; Lei Lei
40549040,"Prediction of methotrexate neurotoxicity using clinical, sociodemographic, and area-based information in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","Methotrexate is a critical component of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy that can result in neurotoxicity which has been associated with an increased risk of relapse. We leveraged machine learning to develop a neurotoxicity risk prediction model in a diverse cohort of children with ALL. We included children (age 2-20 years) diagnosed with ALL (2005-2019) and treated in Texas without pre-existing neurologic disease. Clinical information was obtained by medical record review. Neurotoxicity occurring post-induction and prior to maintenance therapy was defined as neurologic episodes occurring within 21 days of methotrexate. Suspected cases were independently confirmed by 2 pediatric oncologists. Demographic and clinical factors were compared using logistic regression. The dataset was randomly split (80/20) for training and testing. random forest (RF) with boosting and downsampling using 5-repeat, 10-fold cross-validation was used to construct a predictive model. Neurotoxicity developed in 115 (8.7%) of 1325 eligible patients. Several factors including older age at diagnosis (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.15-1.24) and Latino ethnicity (OR = 2.79, 95% CI: 1.83-4.35) were associated with neurotoxicity. The RF had an area under the curve of 0.77 with a train error rate of 0.29 and a test error rate of 0.24. The overall sensitivity was 0.73, and specificity was 0.69. In one of the largest studies of its kind, we developed a novel risk prediction model of methotrexate-related neurotoxicity. Ultimately, a validated model may help guide the development of personalized treatment strategies to reduce the burden of neurotoxicity in children diagnosed with ALL.",The oncologist,2025,Rachel D Harris; Olga A Taylor; Maria Monica Gramatges; Amy E Hughes; Mark Zobeck; Sandi Pruitt; M Brooke Bernhardt; Ashley Chavana; Van Huynh; Kathleen Ludwig; Laura Klesse; Kenneth Heym; Timothy Griffin; Rodrigo Erana; Juan Carlos Bernini; Ashley Choi; Yuu Ohno; Melissa A Richard; Alanna C Morrison; Han Chen; Bing Yu; Philip J Lupo; Karen R Rabin; Michael E Scheurer; Austin L Brown
40549030,Astragaloside's Role in Microglial Neuroinflammation: A Multi-Method Study Combining Experimental and Computational Analyses.,"This study investigates the mechanism by which astragaloside (AST) modulates microglial metabolism to alleviate inflammatory injury following oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R), a model simulating ischemic brain injury. Four groups were studied: Control, Model, AST-treated, and Positive Control (NBP). Cell injury was assessed via CCK-8 assay, and microglial M1 polarization was analyzed by flow cytometry. TNF-α and IL-1β protein levels were measured using ELISA, while IL-1β and IL-10 mRNA expression was quantified by PCR. Core targets were identified through network pharmacology, followed by GO/KEGG enrichment analysis and molecular docking. Protein expression was validated by Western blotting, and metabolic changes were evaluated via metabolomics. AST significantly attenuated OGD/R-induced microglial injury, suppressed TNF-α and IL-1β expression, and inhibited M1 polarization while upregulating IL-10 mRNA. Network pharmacology and molecular docking revealed AST's strong binding affinity to key energy metabolism proteins, including SRC, AKT, and mTOR. Western blotting confirmed activation of SRC and AKT pathways. Metabolomics indicated that AST reversed OGD/R-induced metabolic shifts, downregulating linoleic acid metabolism while modulating glycerophospholipid and pentose phosphate pathways. Astragaloside mitigates OGD/R-induced inflammatory injury by modulating SRC and AKT signaling pathways, leading to metabolic reprogramming in microglia. These findings highlight AST's potential as a therapeutic agent for neuroinflammatory disorders.",Neurochemical research,2025,Dian Ou; Jiating Li; Yiming Shi; Xiaodan Liu; Nujiao Deng; Lequn Peng; Yanling Li; Tingting Xiong; Yang Bai; Wei Zhang; Huang Ding
40549026,Transient receptor potential vanilloid channel 2 contributes to multi-modal endoplasmic reticulum and perinuclear space dilations that can also be observed in prion-infected mice.,"Our recent work on the prion protein and Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (NKAs) led us to revisit data from over 50 years ago, which suggested similarities between vacuolation phenotypes in rodents poisoned with cardiac glycosides (CGs) and spongiform degeneration in prion disease. At that time, this hypothesis was dismissed because the vacuolation observed in prion diseases affects neurons, whereas CG poisoning in rodent brains led to swellings of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in astrocytes. We speculated that this difference might be specific to rodents and document here that the vacuolation shifts to neurons in mice expressing a humanized NKA α1 subunit. Next, we investigated the molecular mechanisms that could cause similar ER vacuolation in human cells in vitro. We found that certain stressors-such as overexpression of NKA α subunits and exposure to specific toxins known to trigger the unfolded protein response-can induce a phenotype characterized by profound ER dilation that is most strikingly observed for the perinuclear space (PNS). The ion imbalance typically caused by functional NKAs does not contribute to this phenotype. In fact, it can occur even with the overexpression of catalytically inactive NKAs. Several lines of evidence, generated with pharmacological agents, ion-specific dyes, antagonists, and truncated expression constructs, suggest that a calcium leak channel in the ER, known as transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (TRPV2), plays a role in this ER and PNS dilation. Additionally, we observed that the formation of these vacuoles coincides with a decrease in steady-state levels of the lipid kinase PIKFYVE, which is recognized for its role in endolysosomal fission and fusion processes. Finally, we found evidence of vacuoles in cryosectioned brains of prion-infected mice that can be filled with a fluorescent marker targeted at the ER and PNS. This raises the possibility that this vacuolation phenomenon contributes to spongiform degeneration seen in prion diseases.",Acta neuropathologica,2025,Wenda Zhao; Shehab Eid; Chris Sackmann; Declan Williams; Xinzhu Wang; Yunqing Ouyang; Thomas Zerbes; Gerold Schmitt-Ulms
40549020,Off-Label but On-Target: Sacral Neuromodulation for Neurogenic Bladder Dysfunction.,"Neurogenic bladder dysfunction (NBD) is a frequent complication of neurological diseases including Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and spina bifida. Managing NBD remains challenging, especially for patients who fail to respond to standard therapies. Sacral neuromodulation (SNM), though FDA-approved for non-neurogenic conditions, is increasingly explored off-label in neurogenic populations. Recent studies demonstrate that SNM can improve lower urinary tract symptoms, bladder storage, and emptying in select NBD patients. Small case series and retrospective reviews suggest reduced catheterization and medication use. Technological advances, such as closed-loop systems and MRI-compatible devices, are broadening SNM's clinical potential. SNM is emerging as a valuable, minimally invasive treatment for neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Careful patient selection and understanding of underlying pathophysiology are essential for success. As evidence grows and device innovations continue, SNM could reshape management strategies for patients with neurogenic bladder.",Current urology reports,2025,Keianna Vogel; Nissrine Nakib
40548975,Resilient outcomes in people with a history of mental disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic: an international 2-years longitudinal prospective study.,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the global population was exposed to a significant psychological stress, which had an impact on the mental health in individuals with pre-existing mental disorders. Despite their heightened vulnerability, subgroups within this population demonstrated resilient outcomes throughout the pandemic. This study aims to identify predictors of long-term, sustained resilient outcomes among people with a history of mental disorder during the first two years of the pandemic. In this international 2-year, 5-wave longitudinal online survey, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and the PTSD Checklist DSM-5 were used for a proxy measure of psychological distress. As possible predictors of sustained resilient outcomes, we investigated socio-demographic characteristics, economic and housing status, pandemic-related issues, chronic diseases, social support, fear of contamination and personal values which were investigated respectively through the Oslo Social Support Scale, the Padua Inventory, and the Portrait Values Questionnaire. Data were analysed with a Mover-Stayer Latent Transition Analysis model. Nine-hundred and forty-three participants with a mental disorder were included in the analysis. Variables associated with a higher chance of sustained resilient outcomes were older age, maintaining a job, and having more people in the household. In contrast, female gender, losing job, difficulty in meeting basic needs, higher fear of contamination, hedonism, less social support and loneliness resulted in a lower likelihood of presenting sustained resilient outcomes. This study identified factors that predictsustained resilience in people with mental disorders. The newly discovered predictors could prove invaluable in developing strategies to enhance the resilience of people with mental disorders during times of crises, such as pandemics.",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,2025,I Pinucci; F Tedeschi; R Serra; M Patanè; C Acartürk; D Andriani; R A Bryant; S Burchert; G Caggiu; D Campos; C Conflitti; C Davisse-Paturet; M Felez-Nobrega; D Fuhr; B J Hall; J M Haro; A C Huizink; C Knaevelsrud; G Kurt; A Lam; I Leijen; R Mediavilla; M Melchior; E Mittendorfer-Rutz; N Morina; M Monzio Compagnoni; P Nicaise; C Palantza; C Panter-Brick; D Papola; S Quero; C Rodriguez Prada; S Seedat; H Setyowibowo; P Smith; J van der Waerden; H Walter; A Witteveen; M Pasquini; M Sijbrandij; C Barbui; L Tarsitani
40548942,The lincRNA Pantr1 is a FOXG1 target gene conferring site-specific chromatin binding of FOXG1.,"Derailed gene expression programs within the developing nervous system, encompassing both transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes, can cause diverse neurodevelopmental diseases (NDD). The NDD FOXG1-syndrome lacks full understanding of the mechanistic role of its eponymous gene product. While it is known that FOXG1 acts in part at the chromatin by binding to regulative regions, it is unclear what factors control its presence at specific sites. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can mediate site-directed transcription factor binding, but their potential role in FOXG1-syndrome has not been described. Here, we show that FOXG1 localisation is regulated at selected loci through the lncRNA Pantr1. We identified FOXG1 as an upstream transcriptional activator of Pantr1 in human and mice. Further, we discovered that FOXG1 has the ability to associate with RNAs. Both transcriptional regulation of Pantr1 by FOXG1 and binding of both partners build up a regulative network that impacts the localisation of FOXG1 at selected genomic loci. Specifically, Pantr1 facilitates cooperative presence of FOXG1/NEUROD1 at specific sites, and Pantr1 reduction leads to redistribution of FOXG1 to comparably more generic binding sites. The rescue of impaired dendritic outgrowth upon FOXG1 reduction by simultaneous overexpression of Pantr1 underlines the importance of the FOXG1/Pantr1 regulative network.",Nucleic acids research,2025,Fabian Gather; Tudor Rauleac; Ipek Akol; Ganeshkumar Arumugam; Camila L Fullio; Teresa Müller; Dimitrios Kleidonas; Ruth Geiss-Friedlander; Andre Fischer; Andreas Vlachos; Rolf Backofen; Tanja Vogel
40548903,Towards Better and More Valid Zebrafish Models of Alzheimer's Disease: A Scientific Tribute to Prof. Mikhail I. Aghajanov.,"The most common form of dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severely debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that afflicts over 50 million people globally. Despite extensive its research using various animal models, nearly all promising AD treatments have failed in clinical trials. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have recently emerged as a valuable alternative to traditional (rodent) models of AD, possessing conserved neurotransmitter systems and disease pathways with humans, as well as orthologs for key genes associated with neurodegenerative disease. Here, we review recent advances and applications of zebrafish to study the pathogenesis of AD, and discuss the advantages, limitations, and potential future directions of research utilizing zebrafish AD models. This paper is dedicated to the late Professor Mikhail I. Aghajanov (1939-2024), a prominent Armenian neurochemist and a true crusader for fundamental AD research.",Journal of neurochemistry,2025,Maria M Kotova; Adam Michael Stewart; Artem Grigoryan; Sanobar Shariff; Foad Mirzaei; Burhan Kantawala; Karen Dilbaryan; Murilo S de Abreu; David S Galstryan; Jiahao Cui; Longen Yang; Konstantin B Yenkoyan; Allan V Kalueff
40548886,Medication Nonadherence in Children and Adolescents with ADHD.,"<b></b><i>Objective:</i> Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects 6-10 % of children and adolescents worldwide. While psychopharmacological treatments effectively reduce symptoms, incomplete adherence is common, diminishing their effectiveness. This study investigated medication nonadherence and its predictors in children and adolescents with ADHD. <i>Method:</i> The TDM-VIGIL study, a multicenter prospective observational study in Germany, examined drug-related risks of ADHD medication in hyperkinetic disorders and nonadherence. Participants aged 6-18 years with ADHD (ICD-10/DSM-IV) starting stimulants or nonstimulants were assessed for nonadherence using the Medication Assessment Questionnaire (MAQ) at multiple time points. Patients were classified as fully or not fully adherent, and logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors. <i>Results:</i> Among 198 participants (mean age = 10.4 years), 66.1 %-75.4 % were fully adherent across time points. Higher age and lower intelligence were significantly associated with nonadherence, while sex, disease severity, adverse events, treatment setting (outpatient, day clinic, inpatient), medication class (stimulant, nonstimulant), and treatment strategy (mono- versus polypharmacy) were not. <i>Conclusions:</i> Medication nonadherence is common in youth with ADHD, with higher age and lower intelligence representing relevant risk factors. Clinicians should consistently monitor adherence and address individual barriers.",Zeitschrift fur Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie und Psychotherapie,2025,Konstantin Mechler; Tobias Banaschewski; Tobias Hellenschmidt; Christoph U Correll; Frank M Theisen; Michael Kaess; Michael Kölch; Gerhard Libal; Tobias J Renner; Jörg M Fegert; Andreas Karwautz; Paul L Plener; Peter Heuschmann; Stefanie Fekete; Marcel Romanos; Karin Egberts; Alexander Häge
40548845,Transient Elastography Increases Readiness for Change in Inpatients With Alcohol Use Disorder: The ELISA Pilot Study.,"Opportunistic interventions (OIs) are health events facilitated by healthcare providers through education that can motivate individuals to adopt risk-reducing behaviours. Our aim was to evaluate transient elastography (TE) as an OI in patients with AUD by assessing changes in validated psychometric scores (PS) of alcohol insight and readiness for change. In this prospective, proof-of-concept pilot study, patients with AUD without TE in the past year were enrolled from an inpatient addiction unit. At baseline, three PS assessing insight and readiness to change were administered: Hanil Alcohol Insight Scale (HAIS), revised Readiness Ruler (RR) and Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES-8A). TE was performed, interpreted, and followed by repeat PS testing. The primary outcome was change in PS. Secondary outcomes were prevalence of fibrosis and steatosis on TE, alcohol use and linkage to hepatology care. From 4 January 2022 to 4 January 2023, 23 patients were enrolled: mean age: 51 years (SD ± 12), 74% male, 61% White and all with severe AUD, and mean of 20 (± 9) daily drinks, 286 g (± 127 g) or 35.7 (± 15.9) units of alcohol, for a median of 14 years (IQR 10-21.5). After TE, there were significant increases in revised RR and SOCRATES-8A from 5 to 8.6 (± 2.1, p < 0.01) and 81.5 to 85.0 (± 8.0, p = 0.04), respectively, indicating improved motivation and readiness for change. HAIS did not change: 11.1-11.0 (± 3, p = 0.36). Cirrhosis and steatosis grade ≥ 2 were detected in 4/23 (17%) and 8/23 (35%), respectively.

40548824,SOD1 Protein Content in Human Central Nervous System and Peripheral Tissues.,"Gene silencing therapy is an effective treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients carrying mutations in the superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) gene aiming to reduce noxious forms of SOD1 in the central nervous system (CNS). The normal steady-state level of SOD1 protein in human CNS is therefore of interest but is contested. In this work we have analyzed SOD1 protein content, total protein content, and SOD1 enzymatic activity in six areas of the CNS as well as in four peripheral tissues from sporadic and familial ALS patients and non-ALS controls. Our results show that SOD1 in the human CNS constitutes around 100 μg/g wet weight corresponding to about 0.16% of the total protein in the studied areas. Of the peripheral tissues analyzed, kidney and erythrocytes contain roughly equal amounts, liver higher, and skeletal muscle lower levels of SOD1 compared to the CNS. This data shows SOD1 protein levels around 10 times lower compared to previously published figures. However, SOD1 can still be considered an abundant protein considering that > 12 000 proteins are expressed in human cells. There was no difference in SOD1 protein content between sporadic or familial ALS patients and control individuals. The level and activity of SOD1 are not deviating in the areas of the CNS that are most vulnerable to ALS. Instead, insufficient control of SOD1 structure and aggregation could be important factors behind the vulnerability of motor areas to SOD1 proteotoxicity.",Journal of neurochemistry,2025,Laura Leykam; P Andreas Jonsson; Karin M E Forsberg; Peter M Andersen; Thomas Brännström; Stefan L Marklund; Per Zetterström

40548693,Brain-derived exosomal hemoglobin transfer contributes to neuronal mitochondrial homeostasis under hypoxia.,"Hypoxia is an important physiological stress causing nerve injuries and several brain diseases. However, the mechanism of brain response to hypoxia remains unclear, thus limiting the development of interventional strategies. This study conducted combined analyses of single-nucleus transcriptome sequencing and extracellular vesicle transcriptome sequencing on hypoxic mouse brains, described cell-cell communication in the brain under hypoxia from intercellular and extracellular dimensions, confirmed that hemoglobin mRNA was transferred from non-neuronal cells to neurons, and eventually expressed. Then we further explored the role of exosomal hemoglobin transfer in vitro, using human-derived cell lines, and clarified that hypoxia promoted the transfer and expression of exosomal hemoglobin between endothelial cells and neurons. We found the vital function of exosomal hemoglobin to protect against neurological injury by maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in neurons. In conclusion, this study identified a novel mechanism of 'mutual aid' in hypoxia responses in the brain, involving exosomal hemoglobin transfer, clarified the important role of exosomal communication in the process of brain stress response, and provided a novel interventional perspective for hypoxia-related brain diseases.",eLife,2025,Zhengming Tian; Yuning Li; Feiyang Jin; Zirui Xu; Yakun Gu; Mengyuan Guo; Qianqian Shao; Yingxia Liu; Hanjiang Luo; Yue Wang; Suyu Zhang; Chenlu Yang; Xin Liu; Xunming Ji; Jia Liu
40548635,Optic Nerve Invasion in Retinoblastoma: Impact of Eye Salvage and Adjuvant Chemotherapy.,"Optic nerve invasion (ONI) is an important risk factor for extraocular metastasis in retinoblastoma. This study evaluates the impact of pre-enucleation chemotherapy, delayed enucleation, and adjuvant chemotherapy on survival in patients with varying degree of ONI on histopathology. A retrospective review of consecutive enucleated eyes with any degree of ONI from 29 Chinese treatment centers 2012-2017. Children with other high-risk histopathological features, extraocular disease at diagnosis or bilateral enucleation were excluded. Among 2500 enucleated eyes, 386 eyes with isolated ONI (one eye per child) met the inclusion criteria: prelaminar (n = 204), intralaminar (n = 70), retrolaminar without tumor at transected optic nerve (n = 96), or retrolaminar with tumor at transected end (n = 16). Primary enucleation was performed in 59% of cases, whereas 41% underwent secondary enucleation after eye salvage therapies. Delayed enucleation beyond six months from diagnosis significantly increased the likelihood of tumor at optic nerve transection (21% vs. 2%; P < 0.001). The five-year cause-specific survival (CSS) was 96.7% overall: prelaminar (100%), intralaminar (98%), retrolaminar without transected end involvement (94%), or tumor at transected optic nerve (58%). Secondarily enucleated eyes with retrolaminar ONI without transected end involvement had lower CSS than those primarily enucleated (85.6% vs. 100%; P = 0.022). The five-year CSS was higher but not statistically significant, for eyes treated with or without adjuvant chemotherapy: intralaminar ONI (100% vs. 95.7%; P = 0.193), retrolaminar ONI without tumor at transected end (100% vs. 93.5; P = 0.413), and tumor at the transected end (80.0% vs. 45.0%; P = 0.192). Timely enucleation reduces the risk of tumor involvement at optic nerve transection. Delay in enucleation by pre-enucleation chemotherapy may reduce the effectiveness of subsequent adjuvant chemotherapy.",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,2025,Zhao Xun Feng; Junyang Zhao; Deion D'Souza; Nan Zhang; Mei Jin; Brenda Gallie
40548629,Does the Association Between Eye Disease and Cognitive Function Vary by Genetic Risk of Cognitive Decline? An Analysis of Hospital Data With Replication in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging.,"Age-related eye diseases are inconsistently associated with cognitive decline which could be due to effect modification. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether two genetic factors previously found to be associated with cognitive decline, the KIBRA (WWC1) and PDE7A/MTFR1 genes, modify the association between eye disease and cognitive function. Data from a Montreal hospital-based cross-sectional study (n = 302) were used for the primary analysis. Candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs17070145 (KIBRA gene) and rs10808746 (PDE7A/MTFR1 gene) were included in linear regression models to test for effect modification of the relationship between eye disease (glaucoma or age-related macular degeneration [AMD]) and cognitive function. Six oral cognitive tests were used. A replication analysis was done using the Quebec data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) (n = 4238). Effect modifications by expanded genomic regions around the candidate SNPs were tested. Three statistically significant interactions with two cognitive function measures -category verbal fluency and immediate story recall-were found in the Montreal study: glaucoma and AMD with rs17070145 and verbal fluency (P < 0.03) and glaucoma with rs10808746 with immediate story recall (P < 0.05). Similar interactions, although not with the same cognitive measure, were found in the CLSA: AMD with KIBRA and glaucoma with PDE7A/MTFR1. Our results suggest that the KIBRA and PDE7A/MTFR1 genes may modify the association between eye disease and cognitive function. This knowledge may help to better understand the mechanism by which glaucoma and AMD are related to cognitive function.",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,2025,Emily Tran; Mohan Rakesh; Gisele Li; Ellen E Freeman; Marie-Hélène Roy-Gagnon
40548556,Measurement of level of PTSD with the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ): bias and precision when using full ordinal or dichotomized items.,"<b>ABSTRACT</b><b>Background:</b> The introduction of the WHO ICD-11 created a need for reliable and valid measures of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD (CPTSD). The International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ) has been applied to different samples and cultures. Previous research using the original ordinal polytomous items supported the construct validity of the ITQ across different language versions in a sample of refugees in treatment and found evidence of locally dependent items and differential item functioning (DIF) relative to gender and time since trauma in the PTSD subscale. Another strand of research on the measurement properties of the ITQ has used dichotomized items and focused on discovering the model that best described the data found no evidence of DIF.<b>Aim:</b> To investigate the consequences of using dichotomized ITQ PTSD items for detecting DIF, other departures from the Rasch model as well as implications for measurement precision.<b>Methods:</b> We used Rasch and graphical log-linear Rasch models for the analysis, as these models have previously been employed in the only psychometric study using the original polytomous ITQ PTSD items.<b>Results:</b> The use of dichotomized PTSD items lead to detection of less DIF than previous research with the polytomous items, and it accentuated local dependence between items and DIF relative to gender. Measurement by scores over dichotomized items increased the standard error of measurement and reduced the reliability to a level, where psychometric theory would conclude that the measure of PTSD was inapplicable. In contrast, previous research has shown measurement by the polytomous ITQ PTSD items to have precision and reliability sufficient for screening for PTSD.<b>Conclusions:</b> The original polytomous ITQ PTSD items are recommended for purposes of studying measurement properties of the ITQ and treatment effects.",European journal of psychotraumatology,2025,Tine Nielsen; Ask Elklit; Sabrina Brødsgaard Nielsen; Mikkel Auning-Hansen; Svend Kreiner; Maria Louison Vang
40548538,A Kidney Transplant Recipient Treated With Migalastat for Fabry Disease for 33 Months.,"Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder characterized by impaired glycosphingolipid metabolism as a result of deficient or absent α-galactosidase A activity.This enzymatic defect leads to the progressive accumulation of glycosphingolipids within various tissues, resulting in multisystem involvement, including renal dysfunction, cardiovascular pathology, cerebrovascular complications, andperipheral neuropathy.This report presents the case of a 57-year-old female who underwent kidney transplant 5 years earlier because of end-stage renal disease of unknown etiology. Genetic screening identified the GLA gene variant c.937G>T (D313Y). The patient exhibited symptoms, including vertigo,tinnitus,headaches, andupperlimbparesthesia, alongside findings of left ventricular hypertrophy and microangiopathic white matter lesions. Initiation of migalastat therapy led to symptomatic improvement without adverse effects orthe need for modifications in her immunosuppressive regimen. After 33 months of migalastat therapy, renal function remained stable, left ventricular hypertrophy resolved, and no progression of cerebral white matter lesions was observed. Thus, migalastat was shown as a well-tolerated and effective therapeutic option for Fabry disease in kidney transplant recipients with amenable GLA mutations.",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,2025,Theodoros Eleftheriadis; Maria Divani; Christina Poulianiti; Maria-Anna Polyzou-Konsta; Evangelos Lykotsetas; Andriani Balatsouka; Ioannis Ioannidis; Ioannis Stefanidis

40548535,Validated Score for Prediction of Neurological Complications After Living Donor Liver Transplant.,"Neurological complications after liver transplant greatly increase patient mortality and morbidity. Our study aimed to assess the prevalence and risk factors associated with neurological complications after liver transplant and to investigate the possibility of creating a predictive model to identify patients more likely to develop these complications. After Institutional Ethics Committee approval, researchers prospectively gathered data on patients who received living donor liver transplant at the Dr. Rela Institute and Medical Centre in Chennai, India, from January 2019 to September 2022. We examined perioperative factors to identify risk factors and evaluated outcomes of interventions in cases involving neurological complications. Among 569 liver transplant recipients, 42 (7.4%) developed neurological complications. Complications included altered sensorium, convulsions, localized neurological deficits, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, and intracranial hemorrhage. Using logistic regression analysis, we identified several independent factors that predicted neurological complications afterlivertransplant.These factors (odds ratio; 95% CI) were preoperative Model for End-Stage LiverDisease score (1.76; 95% CI, 1.05-2.93), preexisting hepatic encephalopathy (2.49; 95% CI, 1.16-5.33), requirement for vasopressor support for >24 hour from end of surgery (3.08; 95% CI, 1.25-7.58), postoperative sepsis (3.55; 95% CI, 1.51-8.34), early allograft dysfunction (5.37; 95% CI, 2.23-12.93), and duration of intensive care unit stay >6 days (3.55; 95% CI, 1.63-7.75). Utilizing regression coefficients, we created a risk index, named Neurological Complications Post-Liver Transplant score (NC-PoLT). A score ≥4 predicted neurological complications after liver transplant (area under the receiver operating curve of 0.87). The NC-PoLT scoring index can serve as a tool to identify patients who may be at risk of developing neurological complications after living donor liver transplant. This internally validated metric aids in predicting outcomes and recognizing target groups for preventive strategies. However, an external validation of this score has not yet been conducted.",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,2025,John S Christian; Akila Rajakumar; Amal F Sam; Susan Paulin; Ashwin Rammohan; Mohamed Rela
40548528,Mitigating fraud in a fully decentralized clinical trial of a digital health intervention.,"Decentralized clinical trials (DCT), digital survey methodologies, and health monitoring technologies create the potential to reduce study participant burden as well as enhance sample diversity and enrollment pace. However, fraudulent participant activity poses a significant threat to study validity and data integrity. This study quantifies fraudulent attempts at participation in a DCT of a mobile mental health intervention for problematic substance use and discusses methods to prevent and detect fraudulent activity. Adults residing in the US reporting problematic substance use were recruited for a fully remote DCT via 2 primary channels: social media advertisements and survey panels. The DCT offered incentives totaling up to $100 for completing assessments over the 12-week study. To prevent and detect fraudulent activity, the research team utilized VPN and proxy detection, checked for duplicate identifiers (e.g., emails, phone numbers, IP Addresses), and compared age and date of birth (DOB) responses across timepoints. Descriptive statistics and group comparisons across the 2 sources of recruitment methodology were utilized to quantify and characterize fraudulent activity. Of the 2,781 eligible screeners completed, 1,725 (62%) were determined to be fraudulent prior to randomization, detected most commonly by duplicate identifiers (65%) and/or VPN and proxy detection (47%). Of the 258 randomized participants, 51 (20%) were later determined to be fraudulent based upon age and/or DOB mismatch. Notable patterns in fraudulent activity (e.g., 42% of fraudulent screening respondents reported the exact age of 30 years; stylistic formatting of email address accounts) were identified. The fraudulent recruitment rate was higher for social media advertising (85%) than survey panels (26%). Both social media and survey panel recruitment resulted in high levels of fraudulent activity in a DCT of a mobile mental health intervention. Researchers conducting DCTs and/or online surveys are urged to take several precautions and preventative measures to insulate against fraudulent activity including embedding identity verification procedures in consent processes. Researchers should consider making personal contact with a participant to verify identity as well as remain vigilant for fraudulent activity and its real-time dynamic potential.

40548495,Wernicke Encephalopathy in a Child With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: A Case Report.,"Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) is a life-threatening neurological disorder caused by thiamine deficiency, commonly associated with alcoholism but also observed in malnourished pediatric cancer patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy. WE remains underdiagnosed in children, with many cases only confirmed postmortem. We report a 6-year-old girl with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who developed WE secondary to treatment-resistant nausea and vomiting. The patient presented with acute gait disturbance, ophthalmoparesis, and paraparesis following persistent vomiting and significant weight loss. Initial diagnostic evaluations, including cerebrospinal fluid analysis and neuroimaging, suggested alternative diagnoses such as cerebellitis and Guillain-Barré Syndrome. However, progressive neurological deterioration, the emergence of encephalopathy, and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of hyperintense lesions in the periventricular, periaqueductal, and cerebellar regions supported the diagnosis of WE. The overlapping features with other neurological conditions contributed to a delay in recognizing WE and initiating thiamine therapy. Despite initiating high-dose intravenous thiamine, symptom resolution was significant but partial. Unfortunately, the patient later developed lymphomatous meningitis and sepsis and ultimately succumbed to complications. This case highlights the importance of early clinical recognition of WE in pediatric leukemia patients with prolonged vomiting, as delayed diagnosis can lead to irreversible neurological damage or death. Given the limitations of early neuroimaging findings, clinical suspicion should prompt immediate thiamine supplementation. The report points out the need for heightened awareness of thiamine deficiency in pediatric oncology, emphasizing the role of prophylactic supplementation in high-risk patients.","Cancer reports (Hoboken, N.J.)",2025,Ghazaleh Shakibamaram; Mohammadreza Dolikhani; Farideh Moussavi; Syna Sarraf; Bredsin Benyamin; Soroor Advani
40548491,"A Short Review of Migraine headaches in Nigeria: Epidemiology, Current Challenges, Treatment Approaches, and Future Directions for Improved Management.","Migraine, a leading cause of global disability, disproportionately burdens low-resource countries like Nigeria, where healthcare inequities, cultural stigma, and infrastructural gaps hinder effective management. Despite global advances in migraine therapeutics, Nigeria's burden remains understudied, with fragmented data on epidemiology, treatment access, and outcomes. We conducted a narrative review of the literature on migraines in Nigeria using sources such as PubMed, MEDLINE, African Journals Online (AJOL), and Embase. This review synthesizes a broad range of peer-reviewed articles, regional reports, and gray literature to provide an interpretative overview of the topic. Available evidence suggests that migraine prevalence in Nigeria is estimated at 15-20%, with urban areas reporting rates as high as 26% and a pronounced gender disparity (3:1 female-to-male ratio). Rural regions experience significant underreporting, often attributed to cultural interpretations of migraine symptoms as spiritual phenomena. Most patients rely on over-the-counter analgesics, with 30% developing medication-overuse headaches. Advanced therapies such as triptans and CGRP inhibitors are largely inaccessible due to prohibitive costs. Nigeria's approach to migraine care lags significantly behind global standards, underscoring the need for context-specific innovations. Priority areas include the expansion of telemedicine to overcome specialist shortages, incentives for local medication production, and the integration of traditional healers into formal referral networks. Policy reforms and collaborative efforts among stakeholders are essential to align Nigeria's migraine management with evidence-based practices, ultimately reducing the burden on individuals and the economy.",West African journal of medicine,2025,Ayokunle Osonuga; Adewoyin A Osonuga; G C Okoye; Odusoga A Osonuga; Adebayo DaCoasta; Ayotunde C Osonuga; Demilade DaCosta
40548445,Recruitment and retention in the concealed weighing arm of a pilot study comparing weighing methods in the treatment of adults with anorexia nervosa: lessons learned.,"Empirically supported treatments for eating disorders (EDs) recommend weighing all patients regularly and sharing that weight with patients (i.e. open weighing). However, many ED treatment providers and programs practice blind, or concealed weighing, in which patients are weighed but not informed of their weight. This Last Word article presents the authors' experiences with recruitment and retention in the concealed weighing arm of a pilot study assessing open versus concealed weighing in a treatment program that is historically accustomed to practicing open weighing. Although clinician anxiety has been associated with the use of blind weighing, it may arise whenever clinicians use a weighing method with which they are less familiar. Careful training and support of all multidisciplinary team members and research study personnel is necessary in order to effectively assess the utility of these different weighing methods to determine whether one is associated with better treatment outcomes for patients.",Eating disorders,2025,Renee D Rienecke; Philip S Mehler; Kim Anderson
40548426,Early treatment versus expectant management of hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus for preterm infants.,"Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitor drugs are used to prevent or treat a PDA. There are concerns regarding adverse effects of COX inhibitors in preterm infants. Controversy exists about whether early targeted treatment of a hemodynamically significant (hs)-PDA improves clinical outcomes. This review updates our previous Cochrane review (2020). To assess the effectiveness and safety of early treatment strategies versus expectant management for hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hs-PDA) in preterm infants. We searched the following sources on 18 October 2024: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, trial registries, and conference abstracts. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which early pharmacological treatment, defined as treatment initiated within the first seven days after birth, was compared to no intervention, placebo, or other non-pharmacological expectant management strategies for treatment of an hs-PDA in preterm (< 37 weeks' postmenstrual age) or low birthweight infants (< 2500 g). The critical outcome was all-cause mortality during hospital stay. Important outcomes included the need for interventional PDA closure, receipt of any PDA pharmacotherapy, chronic lung disease (CLD), severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and moderate/severe neurodevelopmental impairment. We assessed risk of bias in the included studies using Cochrane's RoB 1 tool. We performed data collection and analyses in accordance with the methods of Cochrane Neonatal (fixed-effect meta-analysis using the inverse-variance method). We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for selected clinical outcomes. We included 19 RCTs (2323 participants) and specified two comparisons: seven RCTs (526 participants) compared early treatment (treatment initiated by seven days) and 12 RCTs (1797 participants) compared very early treatment (treatment initiated by 72 hours) versus expectant management. The latter comparison included five new RCTs (1413 participants) published since the 2020 version of this review. We identified one trial awaiting classification and five ongoing trials. Early treatment compared to expectant management for preterm infants Early treatment versus expectant management (no treatment initiated within the first seven days after birth) for an hs-PDA probably results in little to no difference for all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 1.39; risk difference (RD) -0.00, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.02; 6 studies, 500 infants; moderate-certainty evidence), or other important outcomes such as CLD (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.29; RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.03; 4 studies, 339 infants; moderate-certainty evidence); may result in little to no difference in severe IVH (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.16; RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.06; 2 studies, 171 infants; low-certainty evidence), and NEC (RR 2.34, 95% CI 0.86 to 6.41; RD 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.08; 5 studies, 473 infants; low-certainty evidence). Early treatment in the first seven days after birth may result in a large increase in any PDA pharmacotherapy compared to expectant management (RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.86 to 2.83; RD 0.57, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.66; 2 studies, 232 infants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain on the need for surgical PDA ligation or transcatheter occlusion (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.80; RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.03; 4 studies, 432 infants; very low-certainty evidence). Neurodevelopmental outcomes were not reported. Very early treatment compared to expectant management for preterm infants Very early treatment versus expectant management (no treatment initiated within the first 72 hours after birth) for an hs-PDA probably results in little to no difference for all-cause mortality (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.51; RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.05; 12 studies, 1797 infants; moderate-certainty evidence) or other important outcomes such as CLD (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.14; RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.06; 12 studies, 1797 infants; moderate-certainty evidence), severe IVH (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.65; RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.04; 9 studies, 1653 infants; moderate-certainty evidence), NEC (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.31; RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.03; 10 studies, 1745 infants; high-certainty evidence), and moderate/severe neurodevelopmental impairment (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.21; RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.06; 2 studies, 635 infants; moderate-certainty evidence). Very early treatment in the first 72 hours after birth may result in a large increase in any PDA pharmacotherapy (RR 2.02, 95% CI 1.84 to 2.22; RD 0.88, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.90; 8 studies, 1361 infants; low-certainty evidence), but results in a trivial reduction in invasive PDA closure (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.79; RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.01; 10 studies, 1706 infants; high-certainty evidence) compared to expectant management. For outcomes with moderate to very-low certainty, we downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision, or a combination thereof. Sensitivity analysis showed that very early use of ibuprofen may lead to a moderate increase in mortality in extremely preterm infants (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.80; RD 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.08). Early or very early pharmacotherapeutic treatment of an hs-PDA probably results in little to no difference in mortality in preterm infants (moderate-certainty evidence). However, very early use of ibuprofen may lead to a moderate increase in mortality in extremely preterm infants. Conversely, very early treatment of an hs-PDA leads to a trivial reduction in the need for invasive PDA closure (high-certainty evidence). Early or very early hs-PDA treatment may result in little to no difference in CLD, severe IVH, or NEC (low- to moderate-certainty evidence). Very early treatment of an hs-PDA also probably results in little to no difference in moderate to severe neurodevelopmental impairment (moderate-certainty evidence). Given the potential adverse effects of medical therapy, future research should focus on identifying the appropriate patient population for clinical trials to maximize the chances of detecting a clinically meaningful effect while avoiding potential harm.

40548419,"Assessing the Efficacy of Peko-D Forte as Add-on Therapy for Parkinson's Disease: A Proof of Concept, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study.","Hypoestes rosea, an endemic shrub in Nigeria and Cameroon with documented anti-inflammatory properties, has been shown to modify disease progression in transgenic mouse models with Parkinson's Disease PD. We investigated the efficacy and side effect profile of Hypoestes rosea (Peko-D forte) in improving motor performance of PD patients. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept (phase I) study involved 19 patients with mild to moderate PD. Routine dopaminergic therapy was maintained. Following randomization, half of the patients received 4 capsules each of 350 mg Peko-D forte tablets, and the other half, 4 capsules of matching placebo (USP-grade starch) for 8 weeks. After a wash-out period of 4 weeks, patients were switched over (cross-over design). The effects of the medication on motor activity were analyzed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Overall, 14 patients completed the study, comprising 93% males with a mean age of 72 (13.2) years. Their median (IQR) UPDRS score at baseline of 18 (13-20) improved significantly with both Peko-D forte 12 (6 - 16) and placebo 12.5 (9- 15) (p<0.001). Compared to baseline, Peko-D forte improved bradykinesis, rest tremor amplitude and frequency, and rigidity. There was no significant difference between the median UPDRS score with the use of Peko-D forte compared to placebo. The test drug had 93% tolerability with a good side effect profile. Peko-D forte improved motor functions in PD, and it is safe and tolerable. Its efficacy is unclear due to the lack of significant difference between the test drug and placebo. Larger studies will be needed to confirm its efficacy.

40548404,Mortality and hospital admissions in people with eating disorders: longitudinal cohort study in secondary care-linked English primary care records.,"Research on mortality and admissions for physical health problems across eating disorder diagnoses in representative settings is scarce. Inequalities in these outcomes across a range of sociodemographic characteristics have rarely been investigated. We investigated whether people with eating disorders had greater all-cause mortality and physical health-related in-patient admissions compared with those without eating disorders, and whether associations varied by sex, ethnicity, deprivation, age and calendar year at diagnosis. Using primary care Clinical Research Practice Datalink linked to Hospital Episode Statistics, we matched people with an incident eating disorder diagnosis (any, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, eating disorders not otherwise specified, generic eating disorder or a referral code) from primary care Read codes to four people without eating disorders (1:4 matching) on year of birth, sex, primary care practice, year of registration and index date. We used univariable and multivariable Cox (mortality) and Poisson (admissions) models, and fitted interactions to investigate whether associations varied by sociodemographic characteristics. We included 58 735 people (90.1% female, 91.6% White). People with any eating disorders had higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 2.15, 95% CI: 1.73-2.67). Anorexia nervosa had the highest mortality (hazard ratio: 3.49, 95% CI: 2.43-5.01). People with any eating disorders had higher rates of planned (incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.80, 95% CI: 1.4-1.87) and emergency admissions for physical health problems (IRR: 2.35. 95% CI: 2.35-2.46) and emergency admissions for injuries, accidents and substance misuse (IRR: 5.26, 95% CI: 5.24-5.29). Mortality and admission rate ratios were greater in males. People with eating disorders have high rates of mortality and physical health-related admissions. Observed inequalities call for an understanding of why such inequalities exist. These findings highlight the need for prompt and effective treatment for eating disorders, and for improved guidance on primary care management of people with eating disorders.",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,2025,Annie Jeffery; Joseph F Hayes; Naomi Launders; Glyn Lewis; David Osborn; Helen Bould; Naomi Warne; Francesca Solmi
40548384,Loss of PDE10A is associated with metastasis of colon adenocarcinoma.,"<i>Phosphodiesterase 10A</i> (<i>PDE10A</i>), located on cytoband 6q27, acts as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in glioblastoma, where its loss drives aggressive tumor behavior and is associated with a proneural-to-mesenchymal (PN-MES) shift. Leveraging bioinformatic analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pan-cancer dataset, we identified gastrointestinal carcinomas, specifically stomach adenocarcinoma and colon adenocarcinoma, as cancers where 6q27/<i>PDE10A</i> loss is prognostic. In both stomach adenocarcinoma and colon adenocarcinoma, <i>PDE10A</i> loss was associated with reduced overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Additionally, <i>PDE10A</i> loss correlated with increased lymphatic invasion and higher AJCC pathologic nodal stage in colon adenocarcinoma. In an independent institutional cohort, immunohistochemical analysis showed lower PDE10A expression in metastatic colon adenocarcinomas compared to primary tumors. Furthermore, <i>PDE10A</i> loss and decreased protein expression corresponded with an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype in both cohorts, consistent with the known PN-MES shift observed in glioblastoma. In summary, <i>PDE10A</i> loss in colon adenocarcinoma is associated with decreased OS and PFS, more frequent lymphatic invasion, higher pathologic nodal stage, metastatic disease, and an EMT phenotype.",Histology and histopathology,2025,Sumaita Arowa; Nicholas Nuechterlein; Vinny Ha; Allison Shelbourn; Ashis Chowdhury; Yeshavanth K Banasavadi-Siddegowda; Jerzy Lasota; Markku Miettinen; Patrick J Cimino
40548334,Applying the Health Stigma and Discrimination Framework to psychosis stigma in Malawi.,"Psychotic disorders are highly stigmatized across the globe, negatively impacting people with psychosis and their families. However, little is known about stigma faced by people with psychosis in sub-Saharan Africa. We developed semi-structured qualitative guides based in a constructivist epistemology and formative research methodologies and conducted 36 in-depth interviews (IDIs) and two focus-group discussions (FGDs) with 12 people with lived experience (PWLE) with psychosis; 12 caregivers of PWLE; six traditional healers; six medical providers; six community leaders (1 FGD); and six religious leaders (1 FGD) in Blantyre, Malawi. We drew from the Health Stigma and Discrimination Framework to delineate the stigmatization process. Participants described key drivers of stigma as lack of awareness, prejudice, stereotypes, and fear. Manifestations included experienced, anticipated, witnessed, perceived, internalized and secondary stigma in the form of insults, gossip, abuse, physical violence, restraints, social exclusion, and employment-based discrimination from family and community. With respect to negative outcomes and health and social impacts, stigma impacted quality of care, resilience, mental health, morbidity, social inclusion and quality of life. In Malawi, stigma is pervasive challenge for PWLE, with severe implication for their health and social wellbeing. In partnership with PWLE, investment into the integration of evidence-based stigma reduction activities into existing psychosis management programs is warranted.",PLOS mental health,2025,Melissa A Stockton; Jack Kramer; Joshua Chienda; Abigail M Morrison; Harriet Akello Tikhiwa; Griffin Sansbury; Alex Zumazuma; Hillary Mortensen; Mwawi Ng'oma; Patrick Nyirongo; Isaac Mtonga; Jackson Devadas; Bonginkosi Chiliza; Anthony Peter Sefasi; Patani Mhango; Bradley N Gaynes; Brian W Pence; Kazione Kulisewa
40548333,Schwann Cells and Their Exosomes: Research Progress and Prospect in Spinal Cord Injury.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a severe condition that affects the central nervous system (CNS), for which there is currently no effective treatment. Schwann cells (SCs) transplantation for SCI has been well demonstrated in preclinical studies, showing that it can achieve therapeutic goals by improving autonomic function, reducing neuropathic pain, and enhancing limb function through mechanisms such as alleviating inflammation, modulating immunity, and reducing dense scar formation. However, the transplantation of SCs sometimes encounters adverse events, such as low survival rates, significant rejection reactions, limitations on transplantation methods, and the formation of glial scars, all of which severely hinder its clinical application. Meanwhile, SC-derived exosomes (SC-exos) also hold great potential in treating SCI, with specific roles, including immune modulation, anti-inflammatory effects, angiogenesis, apoptosis inhibition, and promotion of axonal regeneration, even surpassing traditional cell therapy in certain aspects. This paper aims to elucidate the potential mechanisms and valuable therapeutic roles of SCs and SC-exos in the treatment of SCI, as well as to provide insights for subsequent research directions by analyzing their current limitations.",Neural plasticity,2025,Xin Wang; Wei Yan; Lin Zhu; Lingzhi Wei; Haobo Cao; Fanni Yang; Yibao Zhang
40548320,Psychotropic Drugs for Older Adults With Psychiatric Disorders Presenting to the Emergency Department: Prescription Patterns and Treatment Outcomes.,"A high proportion of patients presenting to Emergency Departments (EDs) consists of vulnerable elderly people. Mental illnesses are frequently related to advancing age, with difficult to detect symptoms. The aim of this study was to investigate psychiatric drug use by geriatric patients in an ED for whom a psychiatric consultation was needed, according to their psychopathology and severity of outcome. During 2014 to 2023, 342 aged patients (35.96% men and 64.04% women; median age = 73 years, range 68-79 years) sought help at the ED of our hospital and required psychiatric consultation. Male sex, nonsuicidal self-harm, and access through emergency medical services were predictors of >48-h ED stay/hospital admission (the main severity outcome). Patients with bipolar disorder (BD) and psychotic disorders were more socially disadvantaged and with significantly longer length of stay at the ED than the other groups. Additionally, BD patients had more psychiatric drug prescriptions at discharge than patients in the other diagnostic groups. Current nonsuicidal self-harm emerged as a predictor of >48-h ED stay/hospital admission. Future studies should focus on investigating suicide risk in ED contexts, on correct diagnosing and on prescription appropriateness of medications in older adults with psychiatric disorders referring to the ED so to tailor-cut treatment on individual patients' needs. This study highlights the significant impact of psychiatric conditions on healthcare utilization among elderly patients presenting to the ED. The findings emphasize the need for improved diagnosis and management of psychiatric disorders, medication optimization, and tailored treatment approaches.",Psychiatric research and clinical practice,2025,Marianna Mazza; Marcello Covino; Francesco Maria Lisci; Caterina Brisi; Georgios D Kotzalidis; Giuseppe Marano; Francesca Abate; Maria Benedetta Anesini; Gianluca Boggio; Michele Ciliberto; Valeria De Masi; Cecilia Falsini; Ester Maria Marzo; Sara Rossi; Maria Chiara Spera; Alberto Torresi; Benedetta Simeoni; Francesco Franceschi; Gabriele Sani
40548319,Major Depressive Disorder in Long COVID and Exposure to Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines During Infection by SARS-CoV-2.,"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is common in long COVID syndrome; however, the neurobiological mechanisms are unclear. An immune activation response has been associated with COVID-19 severity as well as in MDD. We hypothesize that high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines during SARS-CoV-2 infection may be associated with new-onset MDD and severe outcomes such as treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and risk of suicide ideation and behavior (SI/SB). A case-control nested to a cohort study was carried out on a total of 678 COVID-19 survivors (MDD = 184 vs. non-MDD = 494). A pro-inflammatory panel of serum levels of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-13, IL-17α, TNF-α) was evaluated during COVID-19 hospitalization and severe outcomes such as TRD and SI/SB were assessed in individuals with new onset of MDD after hospital discharge compared to non-MDD COVID-19 survivors. High levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines during SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified in MDD participants compared to non-MDD subgroups during long COVID. These differences were sustained also for TRD and SI/SB severity outcomes. There is a mild association of high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and MDD, TRD, and SI/SB. High levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines during severe or critical COVID-19 exposure may explain long COVID associated MDD and thus severe outcomes such as TRD and SI/SB. Identifying elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines during COVID-19 as a risk factor for MDD and severe outcomes underscores the need for early screening and targeted treatments in long COVID. Monitoring cytokine levels may help clinicians predict and manage TRD and SI/SB in this population, improving long-term psychiatric outcomes.",Psychiatric research and clinical practice,2025,Hernan F Guillen-Burgos; Juan F Gálvez-Flórez; Sergio Moreno-López; Sabrina Wong; Angela T H Kwan; Mariana Ramirez-Posada; Juan-Manuel Anaya; Roger S McIntyre
40548298,CCL2 Inhibitor Bindarit Improve Postoperative Cognitive Function by Attenuating Pericyte Loss-Related Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption and Neuroinflammation.,"Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a common complication in elderly patients undergoing surgery and anesthesia and associated with the impaired recovery. Previous studies have demonstrated that PND was correlated with the pericyte (PC) loss in brain, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigates whether C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) in hippocampal tissues contributes to postoperative PC injury, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, neuroinflammation, and cognitive dysfunction. Sixteen-month-old C57BL/6 mice underwent tibial fracture surgery to induce PND. CCL2 expression in hippocampal tissues was downregulated using intraperitoneal injections of 200 mg/kg daily Bindarit for 4 days prior to surgery. Behavioral tests were conducted on the third day postsurgery and brain tissues were collected. Western blotting assessed CCL2 expression in the hippocampus, immunofluorescence evaluated PC coverage, BBB integrity, and neuroinflammation, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) examined BBB microstructure. Bindarit effectively inhibited the surgery-induced increase in hippocampal CCL2 expression and improved postoperative cognitive function. Behavioral tests, including the open field (OF) test and novel object recognition (NOR) test, indicated enhanced locomotor activity and short-term memory in Bindarit-treated mice compared to controls. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that Bindarit treatment mitigated the reduction in capillary length and tight junction (TJ) protein expression, specifically claudin-5 and occludin, which was seen with decreased PC coverage. Additionally, Bindarit suppressed the activation of hippocampal microglia and astrocytes, as evidenced by reduced Iba-1 and GFAP staining. TEM analysis confirmed that Bindarit preserved BBB microstructure integrity postsurgery. This study demonstrates that the CCL2 inhibitor Bindarit significantly reduces the incidence of PND by preventing PC loss, thereby protecting the BBB and alleviating neuroinflammation. These findings suggest that targeting CCL2 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing and treating PND.",Mediators of inflammation,2025,Hui Yuan; Bo Lu; Daofan Sun; Junping Chen; Xiangming Fang
40548259,Functional Characterization of Variants in <i>LARP7</i>: Report of Three New Individuals With Alazami Syndrome and a Literature Review.,"<b>Introduction:</b> Biallelic pathogenic variants in <i>LARP7</i> result in Alazami syndrome, which is characterized by global developmental delay, cognitive dysfunction, and dysmorphic features. Cardiac and skeletal phenotypes are reported in about 30% of individuals. We report three new individuals with Alazami syndrome and functional characterization of <i>LARP7</i> variants in this study. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> We reviewed electronic patient charts. We applied the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology variant classification algorithms. We performed a 3D protein modeling tool for in silico prediction and functional characterization of <i>LARP7</i> variants using qPCR gene expression experiments. We reviewed the medical literature for Alazami syndrome and <i>LARP7</i>. <b>Results:</b> We report three individuals from two unrelated families with characteristic phenotypes suggestive of Alazami syndrome. We identified a homozygous novel missense <i>LARP7</i> likely pathogenic variant (p.Asp54Val) in Family 1 and a homozygous novel pathogenic <i>LARP7</i> variant (p.Lys219Glu∗) in Family 2 using clinical exome sequencing. 3D protein modeling showed large structural changes for both variants compared to wildtype. The functional characterization showed a statistically significant difference in LARP7 expression between affected individuals and wildtype control. We report phenotypic variability within the same family that the cardiac phenotype was only present in Family 1, Case 2. There were < 60 individuals with Alazami syndrome reported to date. <b>Conclusion:</b> We report three new individuals with Alazami syndrome and two novel variants in <i>LARP7</i>. We report the first missense <i>LARP7</i> variant associated with Alazami syndrome. We report the protein 3D structure of <i>LARP7</i> variants. We show a relationship between the p.Asp54Val <i>LARP7</i> variant and LARP7 expression levels. We think that this could be due to abnormal RNA binding of LARP7 as per the 3D protein modeling prediction tool.",Human mutation,2025,Anastasia Ambrose; Oana Caluseriu; Saadet Mercimek-Andrews
40548171,"Mental Health Workforce Inequities Across Income Levels: Aligning Global Health Indicators, Policy Readiness, and Disease Burden.","Despite growing recognition of mental health as a global priority, a critical knowledge gap persists regarding how workforce availability aligns with the burden of mental disorders across income levels. This perspective addresses that gap by comparing mental health workforce indicators and disease burden metrics from the World Health Organization and United Nations datasets, stratified by country income level. The findings reveal a striking misalignment: low- and lower-middle-income countries report the highest disability-adjusted life years due to depression, bipolar disorder, and suicide, yet possess the lowest density of psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, and social workers per 100,000 population. Conversely, high-income countries demonstrate stronger alignment between disease burden and workforce capacity, supported by greater policy readiness and financial allocation. Importantly, this analysis identifies not only a quantitative shortfall in human resources but also a qualitative gap in policy implementation, including limited enforcement, weak integration into primary care systems, and insufficient accountability mechanisms. Even where national mental health plans exist, compliance and execution remain limited, particularly in low-income settings. These inequities compromise efforts toward universal health coverage and Sustainable Development Goal 3.4 on mental well-being.

40548170,A Multilevel Analysis of the Association Between Quality of Antenatal Care and Folic Acid Supplementation During Pregnancy Among Guatemalan Women.,"<b>Background:</b> Folic acid supplementation during pregnancy is essential for preventing neural tube defects and other congenital anomalies. Despite global recommendations, supplementation remains suboptimal in many low- and middle-income countries, including Guatemala, where disparities persist across regions and populations. <b>Objective:</b> To investigate the association between the quality of antenatal care and folic acid supplementation among pregnant women in Guatemala. <b>Design and Setting:</b> This cross-sectional study used data from the 2014-2015 Encuesta Nacional de Salud Materno Infantil (ENSMI), part of the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). A total of 9523 women aged 15-49 with children under two years were included. Folic acid supplementation was assessed through self-reported responses to survey questions. Multilevel logistic regression examined the association between antenatal care quality and folic acid supplementation, accounting for individual, household, and community-level factors. <b>Results:</b> Overall, 15.4% of women reported not taking folic acid during pregnancy. Lower folic acid supplementation was most notable among women who received no or inadequate antenatal care, indigenous women, and those living in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. Women without antenatal care had 97% lower odds of folic acid supplementation compared with those with adequate care (OR = 0.03, 95% CI: 0.02-0.04, and <i>p</i> < 0.001), while intermediate care was associated with 41% lower odds (OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.47-0.74, and <i>p</i> < 0.001). Indigenous women had 26% lower odds of supplementation (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.63-0.86, and <i>p</i> < 0.001), and women in communities with high levels of no media exposure had 33% lower odds of folic acid supplementation (OR = 0.67 and 95% CI: 0.53-0.84). <b>Conclusions:</b> Quality antenatal care plays a critical role in improving maternal nutrition behaviors. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions, such as culturally tailored education, mass media campaigns, and improved access to antenatal careto increase folic acid supplementation among pregnant women in Guatemala.","Global health, epidemiology and genomics",2025,Sueny P Lima Dos Santos; Raegan Yuncker; Ilana R A Chertok; Zelalem T Haile
40548157,Management Challenges of Psychosis and Aggression Secondary to Traumatic Brain Injury: A Report of Two Cases.,"Millions of people in the United States suffer from traumatic brain injury (TBI) yearly. Individuals recovering from moderate to severe TBI are at risk of developing medical and psychiatric comorbidities. Psychosis due to TBI appears to be an infrequent yet serious complication. Psychosis secondary to TBI is debilitating, and its management remains challenging. Individuals may have complex clinical presentations, such as behavioral disturbances (impulsivity or aggression) or other comorbid conditions (anxiety, depression, PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), substance use disorders, and seizure disorders). Atypical antipsychotics are the first line of treatment, along with psychotherapy. Mood stabilizers or antidepressants should be considered for mood disturbance. Other comorbid conditions must be addressed promptly to improve outcomes and stabilize the patient in the community. In this article, we discuss two cases that developed psychosis secondary to TBI along with comorbid conditions and their management.",Cureus,2025,Jude Beauchamp; Tania Sultana; Amir Meftah; Satwant Singh; Chino Ezema; Sana Elham Kazi; Muhammad Azam; Jacky S Petion; Bamidele O Johnson; Esther U Ezenagu; Bashir Aribisala; Thant Htet; Patrice Fouron; Jeffery Lawrence; Tolu Olupona
40548133,An atypical presentation of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in a patient with cryptococcal meningitis in the setting of fingolimod therapy for multiple sclerosis.,"Central nervous system (CNS) cryptococcosis in the setting of fingolimod therapy for multiple sclerosis is an increasingly recognised, and often fatal entity. Furthermore, some patients may develop immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) after the initiation of anti-fungal therapy and cessation of fingolimod. Clinical and radiological progression despite appropriate antifungal treatment often leads to a therapeutic dilemma of whether to use corticosteroids if IRIS is suspected. We present a case of a patient with CNS IRIS that responded to oral prednisolone treatment, in the setting of CNS cryptococcal infection and background fingolimod therapy. Interestingly, our patient had a normal CD4 and total peripheral lymphocyte count. This case serves as a reminder that a high index of suspicion is needed when patients who are being treated with fingolimod, present with subtle symptoms and signs of meningitis, and, additionally, it provides further evidence that IRIS in HIV negative patients, may respond to corticosteroid treatment.",IDCases,2025,Henco Nel; Siong Hui
40547875,Sensory processing in medically unexplained pain syndrome. A systematic review.,"Chronic pain is inherently multifactorial, with biological, psychological and social factors contributing to neuropathic pain (NP) and central sensitization (CS) syndromes. Comorbidity between functional disorders and the lack of clinical biomarkers adds to the challenge of diagnosis and treatment, leading to frustration for healthcare professionals and patients. The main objective of this review is to investigate the association between NP, CS syndromes and sensory processing disorders. A structured search was conducted on the PubMed database using the keywords Central Sensitization, Fibromyalgia, Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, and Neuropathic Pain, combined with the keywords Vision, Audition, Olfaction, Touch, Taste, and Proprioception. PubMed was chosen because it is accessible and user-friendly. Articles within the last five years, from 2018 to 2023, have been included. 380 studies on conditions of CS and sensory processing were identified. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, the number of retained papers was 78. There were a few emerging themes. Reduced sensory thresholds were found to be comorbid with chronic pain conditions, particularly those with a component of CS. Both cranial nerve and sensory evaluation examinations may prove helpful as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and for potential treatments.","Frontiers in pain research (Lausanne, Switzerland)",2025,Nicole Quodling; Norman Hoffman; Frederick Robert Carrick; Monèm Jemni
40547867,Effect of <i>L</i>-theanine on cerebellar granule cell migration related to cognitive disorders.,"Cerebellar granule cell migration plays a crucial role in cerebellum development, and any abnormalities in CGC migration can lead to significant neurological disorders such as anxiety, a common psychological disorder that impacts a person's emotional, physical, and social health. <i>L</i>-theanine, an amino acid found in green tea, demonstrates neuroprotective properties and regulates the release of neurotransmitters by stimulating CGC migration. This study investigated the impact of <i>L</i>-theanine on CGC migration related to cognitive disorders. <i>ddY</i> male mice treated with a single oral dose of <i>L</i>-theanine at varying concentrations (10 mg/kg) were assessed for anxiety, learning, and memory using the maze test and the Morris Water Maze test, where the average completion time and escape time of the mice were considered indicators of cognitive performance. CGC microexplants were isolated from newly born <i>C57BL/N6</i> mice and treated with a series of increasing concentrations of <i>L</i>-theanine. The migration distance of the CGC under the different <i>L</i>-theanine concentrations was assessed after 24, 48, and 72 h post-treatment using phase-contrast microscopy and image analysis software. Mice's anxiety symptoms improved based on their performance on the maze test after treatment with <i>L</i>-theanine at 5 mg/ml. However, <i>L</i>-theanine at 0.05 mg/ml enhanced learning and memory abilities. Compared to other concentrations, <i>L</i>-theanine at 1 µM yielded the longest migration distance for CGC <i>in vitro</i>. Therefore, <i>L</i>-Theanine may serve as a potential therapeutic agent in supporting cerebellar development and enhancing cognitive skills. Further investigation is required to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential of <i>L</i>-theanine in neurodevelopmental disorders.",IBRO neuroscience reports,2025,Mai Ibrahim; Matsuda Tomoko; Kuriya Kenji; Ozeki Makoto; Abe Aya; Hayato Umekawa; Masahiro Nishio
40547769,"A study to determine the relationship between sleep quality and socioeconomic status of the nursing officers working in a selected hospital, Bhubaneswar.","Sleep is a vital biological function, critical for maintaining physical and mental health. Nursing officers, because of their demanding shift work, often experience disrupted sleep patterns. This study aims to determine the association between sleep quality and socioeconomic status among nursing officers in a selected hospital in Bhubaneswar. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Modified Kuppuswamy Scale. An online questionnaire using Google Forms was distributed to 236 nursing officers aged over 25 years. Exclusion criteria included officers on maternity leave, those with a history of sleep disorders, chronic illnesses affecting sleep, and those on sleep-inducing medication. Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 29, with descriptive statistics and Kruskal-Wallis tests used to examine bivariate associations. The majority of participants (66.5%) were aged 25-30 years, with 75.8% being female and 80.9% unmarried, and socioeconomic status was assessed through educational qualifications, occupation, and family income. While there was no significant difference in PSQI scores based on age, gender, and educational qualifications, a significant association was found between PSQI scores and both occupation (<i>P</i> < 0.001) and family income (<i>P</i> < 0.001), with clerks and low-income families showing poorer sleep quality. The study highlights a significant association between sleep quality and socioeconomic factors such as occupation and family income among nursing officers. These findings suggest that socioeconomic disparities contribute to variations in sleep quality, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to improve sleep health among nursing professionals.",Journal of family medicine and primary care,2025,Indrani Sen; Anannya Chatterjee; Ishita Bhattacharya; Soudamini Pahi; R Asokan; Chandan Pradhan; Minati Das; Nibedita Mohanty
40547582,Formalizing Lacanian psychoanalysis through the free energy principle.,"This study presents a computational formalization of Lacanian psychoanalysis using the framework of the free energy principle (FEP)-a theoretical framework for modeling self-organizing systems across multiple scales. We first examine the theoretical compatibility between the two frameworks, highlighting their shared (1) Kantian epistemological foundations regarding the unknowability of reality, (2) constructive nature of internal representational systems, (3) non-linear temporal dynamics that combine prediction and retrospection, and (4) emphasis on representation failures as key driving forces. Building on these convergences, we develop a computational framework that implements core Lacanian concepts through the FEP framework. Through multi-level simulations, this framework captures the interdependence of <i>three orders</i> as a message-passing network, formalizes <i>desire</i> as generalized synchronization between subjects' Symbolic orders, and models <i>the Other</i> through collective dynamics. This FEP-based reformulation renders traditionally obscure Lacanian concepts computationally tractable, thereby establishing a conceptual bridge between Lacanian psychoanalytic insights and cognitive science.",Frontiers in psychology,2025,Lingyu Li; Chunbo Li

40547483,"Long-term, bidirectional associations between depressive symptom severity and opioid use among people with HIV: A prospective cohort study.","The bidirectional relationships between opioid use and depressive symptom severity among people living with HIV (PLHIV) are poorly understood. We hypothesized that higher opioid use frequency would be associated with greater subsequent depressive symptom severity and that greater depressive symptom severity would be associated with higher subsequent opioid use frequency. We analyzed data from the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) - survey sample, a prospective cohort including PLHIV receiving care at 8 US Veterans Health Administration sites. From 2002 to 2018, we assessed past year opioid use frequency based on self-reported heroin and/or prescription opioid use at study entry and follow-up, as well as depressive symptom severity. Time-lagged, generalized estimating equation models were used to construct estimates of the association between opioid use frequency and subsequent depressive symptom severity, and vice versa, adjusting for key sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. In final adjusted models that included 2033 PLHIV (98 % male), subsequent depressive symptom severity was greater (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.44, 95 % CI: 1.22,1.70) for those who used opioids at least monthly compared to those who never used, and the association between these variables appeared to follow a dose-response pattern. Similarly, subsequent opioid use frequency was higher (aOR = 1.38, 95 % CI: 1.17,1.62) for those with moderate depressive symptom severity compared to those with none. Enhanced access to screening for substance use disorders, harm reduction services, and medications for opioid use disorder may be warranted in settings that serve veteran PLHIV; strategies expanding access to mental health services may also be promising.",Addictive behaviors reports,2025,Alexandria Macmadu; Yu Li; Fiona Bhondoekhan; Chung-Chou H Chang; Anees Bahji; Stephen Crystal; Kirsha S Gordon; Robert D Kerns; Rachel A Vickers-Smith; E Jennifer Edelman; Brandon D L Marshall
40547464,Evaluating the burden of caregivers of patients with visual impairment: a multicenter pilot study in Italian visual rehabilitation centers.,"Despite growing evidence that underscores the importance of the caregiver's role in the rehabilitation process, visual rehabilitation (VR) programs often overlook these needs. The aim of this pilot study is to investigate the caregiving burden (CB) among informal caregivers of visually impaired (VI) patients who attend Italian VR centers, setting the bases for large-scale research. Four Italian VR centers were involved. Demographic data and IADL (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale) questionnaire to assess the degree of autonomy of VI patients were collected. Regarding the caregiver, the Italian validated version of the ""Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI)"" was administered. Fifty patients and their caregivers were included. The mean total CBI score was 23.6 points (SD 18.4), which is about the threshold for abnormal stress score. Moreover, 9 (18%) caregivers had scores ≥39, suggesting burn-out or mental disorder. The time-dependent (rho = 0.88), developmental (rho = 0.93), and physical burden (rho = 0.87) domains demonstrated the strongest correlations with overall CBI score. Furthermore, each additional hour of caring increased the score by 1.07 points (<i>p</i> = 0.004). No association was detected between total CBI score and other patient's characteristics, including dual sensory deficit (auditory and visual), as well as patient's IADL score. In this pilot study in VI patients attending VR services, about one half of caregivers of VI patients experienced stress, with 1 in 5-6 suffering from burn-out or mental health issues. Larger studies should assess both the outcome and the resources needed to screen for CB, with care integrated in the patient rehabilitation pathway.",Frontiers in public health,2025,Gianni Virgili; Francesco Ferron; Federico Bartolomei; Ruth Van Nispen; Eliana Costanzo; Giovanni L Ciaffoni; Emanuela Rellini; Simona Turco; Marina Piepoli; Simona Di Pietro; Stefania Fortini
40547463,Association of sleep duration and sleep quality with cognitive frailty in Chinese older adults.,"To explore the relationship between sleep duration, sleep quality and the occurrence of cognitive frailty in the older adults. A total of 9,970 participates were screened in China over the past 9 years. They were divided into cognitive frailty group and non-cognitive frailty groups, and they were evaluated for sleep duration and sleep quality and their relationship with cognitive frailty was analyzed. If interactions are found, further hierarchical analysis is conducted. One thousand six hundred eighty-four participants (16.89%) were diagnosed with cognitive frailty. Participants with cognitive frailty were more likely to be ""unmarried,"" live in rural areas, and were female, with no social activity in the last month. Poor sleep quality, short sleep duration, no napping, and excessive napping are at high risk of cognitive frailty. There was a significant interaction between daytime napping and sleep duration and sleep quality. Among participants with good sleep quality, those who took excessive naps had a 123% increased risk of developing cognitive frailty, with an OR of 2.23 (95% CI: 1.72, 2.86). In the subgroup with sleep duration > 9 h, participants who napped excessively had a significantly increased risk of cognitive frailty (OR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.14-2.30, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Chinese older adults with poor sleep quality are at a 67% higher risk of cognitive weakness, and individuals with less than 6 h of sleep are at a 48% higher risk of cognitive weakness; No napping and excessive napping, the risk of cognitive debilitation increased by 23 and 69%, respectively.

40547443,Music therapy for the treatment of anxiety: a systematic review with multilevel meta-analyses.,"A considerable number of published clinical trials have examined the anxiety-reducing effects of music therapy interventions across several settings, including mental health care, medical environments, and work- and study-related contexts. Music therapy involves personally tailored music interventions that are designed and implemented by qualified music therapists to meet the specific health needs of individual patients. To summarise this evidence base, we conducted a linear restricted maximum likelihood multilevel meta-analysis searching multiple electronic databases (CINAHL, Cochran Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science core collection), from inception to 12th February 2025. The primary measure was the effects of music therapy on 7 psychological anxiety outcomes and physiological outcomes. The secondary measures were outcome, study, sample, or intervention design factors that moderate the effects of music therapy interventions. Meta-analyses were performed on 93 effect sizes (ES) from 51 studies to assess the magnitude of effects of music therapy targeting anxiety outcomes, and to compare effects across key intervention and study design factors. PROSPERO registration (CRD42024495801). Of the 10,210 identified records, 6147 records were screened and 51 articles meeting the research criteria were included. Results showed an overall medium effect of music therapy across all anxiety outcomes (<i>g</i> = 0.357, [0.201, 0.514]; 51 trials, 93 ES), of which a medium effect was found in participants' self-reported anxiety (<i>g</i> = 0.410, [0.236, 0.585]; 50 trials, 61 ES) and a small non-significant effect in physiological outcomes (<i>g</i> = 0.153 [-0.153, 0.400]; 13 trials, 32 ES). Subgroup analyses showed significant larger effects for receptive and combination of active and receptive interventions when compared with active interventions. The findings suggest that music therapy, particularly receptive methods or combinations of receptive and active approaches, offer effective, flexible, and scalable interventions for reducing anxiety symptoms, offering psychological benefits that enhance patient autonomy and quality of life, though its impact on physiological outcomes and long-term effects requires further research.

40547364,"Falls, Sleep Disorders and Cognitive Frailty in Hospitalized Older Adults with Hypertension:A Cross-Sectional Study.","Falls and fall-related injuries are highly prevalent among older adults. Falls negatively impact functional independence and quality of life, and are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Sleep disorders in the older adults are a common phenomenon, with sleep quality gradually deteriorating as age increases. Cognitive frailty(CF) refers to the presence of both physical frailty(PF) and mild cognitive impairment(MCI) without simultaneous diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease(AD) or other dementia. Epidemiological studies have confirmed the association between falls and sleep disorders, as well as CF. However, no studies have yet investigated the relationship between falls, sleep disorders and CF in hospitalized older adults with hypertension. Our study is to explore the relationship between falls and both sleep disorders and CF in hospitalized older adults with hypertension, providing a basis for fall prevention. Demographic characteristics were collected from hypertensive patients aged 65 and above who were hospitalized in the Department of Geriatrics at Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, from July 2022 to June 2024. These patients were assessed for history of falls, sleep quality, CF, depression and nutritional status. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the correlation between falls and both sleep disorders and CF. A total of 266 older adults with hypertension were surveyed in this study, of whom 108 reported having fallen once or more in the past year. Both sleep disorders and CF were significantly associated with an increased risk of falls (sleep disorders: OR=2.625, 95% CI 1.214-5.678, P=0.014; CF: OR=5.920, 95% CI 2.632-13.314, P<0.001). Other significant risk factors included: Age (OR=1.119, 95% CI 1.055-1.188, P<0.001), Comorbidities (OR=2.855, 95% CI 1.353-6.024, P=0.006), Polypharmacy (OR=4.126, 95% CI 1.937-8.793, P<0.001), Compared to hospitalized older adults with hypertension with good nutritional status, those with malnutrition had a 4.698-fold higher risk of falls (95% CI 1.724-12.800, P=0.002). The incidence of falls was higher among hospitalized older adults with hypertension.

40547356,Trends in prevalence and burden of depressive disorders in Iran at national and subnational levels: estimates based on sex and age groups.,"Mental disorders rank among the leading contributors to the global disease burden, with depressive disorders being among the most prevalent. The objective of this study is to examine the prevalence, incidence and years lived with disability (YLDs) associated with depressive disorders, particularly major depressive disorder and dysthymia, in Iran from 1990 to 2021. To achieve this, the research focused on analysing these metrics across various dimensions, including temporal trends, sex differences, age categories and subnational regions. The data used in this study are sourced directly from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, ensuring that the information is both authoritative and reliable. All-age count estimates and age-standardised rates (per 100 000) were calculated for prevalence, incidence and YLDs. The disease burden indicators were analysed for the period spanning from 1990 to 2021, stratified by sex, age and location. The percentage change between 1990 and 2021 was also documented. The 95% uncertainty interval (UI) was reported for each of the reported estimates. The prevalence of depressive disorders in Iran demonstrated a notable upward trend from 1990 to 2021, with the rate of growth being particularly pronounced within the country. The age-standardised prevalence rate per 100 000 individuals for depressive disorders in Iran was 5609 (95% UI 4810 to 6488). By 2021, the number of depression cases in Iran reached 5.2 million, which is approximately 2.37 times the figure reported in 1990. The prevalence of depressive disorders was notably higher among females compared with males. The age-standardised prevalence rate per 100 000 individuals for males was 4184 (95% UI 3545 to 4929). For females, this figure was significantly greater, reaching 7077 (95% UI 6115 to 8172). Out of the total reported cases of depressive disorders in Iran, 3.2 million were observed in females, while males accounted for 2 million cases. The findings highlighted the considerable impact of depressive disorders in Iran, both nationally and regionally, while also revealing variations across sex and age groups. Given the shifts in the demographic structure and the growing burden of these disorders, it is essential to prioritise screening initiatives, education programmes and strategies aimed at enhancing mental health awareness and ensuring improved access to mental health services in health policy planning.",General psychiatry,2025,Sohrab Amiri; Moien A B Khan
40547352,"Double Burden of Financial Constraints and Stigma with Isolation of Families of Bipolar Mood Disorder Patients: A Constructivist Grounded Theory Analysis from Tamil Nadu, India.","The family members of the bipolar patients are subjected to stigma and mental and physical abuse by the bipolar patient. This can reflect as expressed emotion and ultimately affect the financial and physical well-being of the patient and family members. The aim of this study was to understand various challenges faced by caregivers of bipolar disorder patients and their families, including emotional well-being, and financial challenges, as well as community and health system support. A constructivist grounded theory approach is used to understand the issue and develop themes. Caregiving for individuals with bipolar disorder often presents gender-related differences, as women experiencing greater emotional burden and stress compared to men, who may focus more on financial and emotional support. These responsibilities are further complicated by financial constraints related to treatment, as the high costs of medication, therapy, and hospitalizations can be overwhelming, especially for families with limited resources or inadequate insurance coverage. Additionally, stigma and isolation significantly impact both patients and caregivers, as societal misconceptions, workplace discrimination, and excessive concern from the community can lead to withdrawal and reluctance to seek help, worsening mental health outcomes. Gender-based disparity in the well-being of caregivers of mental disorders is a neglected issue, which needs further research and support. Also, health system strengthening and community education are essential to improve the well-being of family members and caregivers of bipolar disorder patients.",Indian journal of psychological medicine,2025,Vrinda Sankar Kala; Arul Saravanan R; Manesh Muraleedharan; Sammita Jadhav; Tanay Trivedi
40547337,Common Neural Correlates for Subjective and Objective Sleepiness Indices: A Functional Connectivity Study.,"This study examined the neural correlates in functional brain connectivity common to subjective and objective sleepiness. Because functional connectivity can be measured at rest and during tasks, it is well suited for exploring the commonalities between sleepiness during psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) and at rest with measurement of The Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Serial resting and task-based fMRI measurements across various states of arousal may reveal a common neural substrate that does not vary with task demands. The neural basis shared by the PVT, an objective measure highly sensitive to sleep debt, and subjective reports of sleepiness may be robust markers for sleepiness and contribute to an improved understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying sleepiness. The participants were 16 healthy right-handed (self-reported) adult men who, after a 2-week home examination, participated in a 14-day/13-night experiment that included 9 days of extended sleep (12 h per night), followed by one night of total sleep deprivation (0 h), and recovery sleep. KSS and the PVT were used as subjective and objective measures of sleepiness, respectively. Functional connectivity in the brain during each condition were measured using fMRI. In particular, the association between the inverse of the reaction time to the PVT task and resting-state functional connectivity was analyzed using a general linear mixed model. Functional connectivity in six pairs of regions commonly associated with the KSS and PVT were identified. These included the anterior cingulate cortex-posterior cingulate cortex (part of the default mode network) and thalamus-middle temporal cortex, indicating that connectivity in these brain regions were strongly associated with sleepiness. These results suggest a common neural substrate for subjective and objective sleepiness, which may be an important indicator of sleepiness. In addition, the functional connectivity between the thalamus and the middle temporal cortex may be a new network that deserves further attention in sleep research. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the effects of sleep deprivation and total sleep deprivation experienced in daily life on the brain and offer a new perspective on the expression of sleepiness in the brain.",Nature and science of sleep,2025,Yuki Motomura; Shingo Kitamura; Kentaro Oba; Ruri Katsunuma; Yuri Terasawa; Akiko Hida; Yoshiya Moriguchi; Kazuo Mishima
40547330,System readiness and the patient care pathway for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and treatment.,"Promising therapeutic interventions that target the underlying pathophysiology are changing the landscape of Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. The AD care pathway must be transformed to meet the challenge of bringing these new therapies to the increasing number of people living with AD within the existing healthcare framework. Challenges include identifying patients who may benefit from treatment interventions early in the course of the disease, ensuring that diagnostic tools are accessible and accurate, and developing capabilities to monitor the effectiveness of interventions over time. These challenges must be addressed at all levels, from primary care settings to tertiary treatment centers; this will require collaborative efforts between health systems, drug manufacturers, and research institutions to navigate this evolving landscape and ensure system readiness for patients and their families with AD. The Spring 2024 Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable (AARR) meeting gathered industry representatives and clinicians to discuss insights, challenges, and solutions that will help researchers and health systems identify patients in the early stages of AD and deliver emerging therapies efficiently and safely.

40547269,HIV Virologic Suppression and Mental Well-being in Adolescents and Young Adults Living with HIV.,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) care programs in resource-limited settings reserve counseling and referral for individuals with identified mental illness for those with HIV virological treatment failure (VTF). Adolescence is a period that may increase the likelihood of internalizing psychiatric disorders (IPDs). We assessed the relationship between HIV VTF and symptoms of IPDs among adolescents and young adults (AYA) living with HIV in Gaborone, Botswana. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Botswana from December 2018 to December 2019 among AYA living with HIV aged 12-24 years. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine relationships between age, sex, and HIV VTF (≥400 copies/mL) and clinically relevant IPD symptoms, namely, depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score of ≥10) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 score of ≥10). Of 553 participants, most were aged 16-19 years (53%) with an equal sex distribution; the minority had VTF using HIV viral load (VL) cutoff levels of ≥400 copies/mL (11%). Close to one-sixth (15%) had clinical depression symptoms; participants aged 16-19 years and 20-24 years were more likely to have clinically relevant depression symptoms when compared to participants who were aged 12-15 years (odds ratio [OR] 3.160, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.094-9.123 and OR 4.748, 95% CI 1.624-13.877, <i>p</i> = 0.0117, for participants aged 15- 19 years and 20-24 years, respectively). Participants with clinically relevant anxiety symptoms (11%) or both clinically relevant anxiety and depression symptoms (8%) did not differ from those without these symptoms by age, gender, or VTF status. Similar results were observed using HIV VL cutoff levels of <1000 copies/mL. HIV VTF may be a poor proxy for mental well-being among AYAs receiving HIV. Universal screening should be considered for AYA receiving care for HIV.",International journal of MCH and AIDS,2025,Barbara Burmen; Gregory Kurtzman; Anthony A Olashore; Leyla Baghirova-Busang; Ohemaa Poku; Phenyo Morakanyane; Ontibile Tshume; Onkemetse Phoi; Mogomotsi Matshaba; Elizabeth D Lowenthal; Knashawn H Morales; Merrian J Brooks
40547215,Development of a brief inpatient curriculum to enhance trainee skills in assessment and treatment of adolescents with substance use and co-occurring mental health problems.,"Adolescence is a critical period for substance use intervention, yet few youth receive evidence-based treatment for both co-occurring substance use and mental health problems. Gaps in professional training limit adequate assessment and treatment of substance use problems among youth receiving psychiatric treatment. We developed a two-session curriculum, integrated into a child/adolescent psychiatry inpatient rotation, to improve knowledge and skills in evidence-based practices for screening, brief intervention, psychoeducation, and care coordination, among multidisciplinary mental health clinicians. A pre/post survey evaluated perceived helpfulness, confidence in clinical skills, and intentions to engage in evidence-based practices. Trainees perceived the content as helpful and reported significant increases in confidence and intention to engage in the targeted evidence-based practices. Implementation of a brief, focused, skills-based curriculum in clinical settings can effectively introduce trainees to core concepts not currently adequately covered in existing curricula.",International journal of psychiatric trainees,2025,Timothy D Becker; Timothy R Rice; Iliyan Ivanov
40547212,Lifestyle and Occupational Factors Associated with Recurrent Stroke among Working-Age Adults in Urban Areas of Thailand.,"Stroke survivors, particularly those of working age, are at an increased risk of recurrent stroke within one-five years of the initial event, largely due to suboptimal management of risk factors. This study aimed to identify lifestyle and occupational factors associated with recurrent stroke in this demographic population. This case-control study included 100 patients with recurrent ischemic stroke and 200 ischemic stroke survivors without recurrence, who were recruited from the hospital database. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify significant factors associated with recurrence, which were presented as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The mean age was 45.4 years (SD = 15.1) among cases and 50.6 years (SD = 6.5) among controls. The male-to-female ratios were 1.17:1 and 1.94:1 in the case and control groups, respectively. Significant factors associated with recurrent stroke included female sex (aOR: 1.83; 95% CI [1.10-3.29]), high fasting blood sugar (aOR: 3.70; 95% CI [1.66-8.27]), current alcohol consumption (aOR: 3.63; 95% CI [2.01-6.54]), sedentary lifestyle (aOR: 2.77; 95% CI [1.50-5.13]), and lack of workplace support for health (aOR: 2.02; 95% CI [1.13-3.63]). The associations between these factors and stroke recurrence varied according to the age group. This study highlights the critical role of modifiable lifestyle and occupational factors in stroke recurrence among working-age adults. Tailored age-specific prevention strategies-emphasizing physical activity, reduced alcohol use, and improved workplace health environments-may reduce the risk of recurrence and enhance health outcomes in this population.",F1000Research,2024,Yupha Wongrostrai; Araya Chiangkhong; Charin Suwanwong; Anon Khunakorncharatphong
